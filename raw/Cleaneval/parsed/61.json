I want to know what graphics cards, ram and processor everyone is using and how well fs2004 performs. I currently have: 512mb ram 2.8 ghz intel extreme graphics card 2 Back to top 99jolegg Chief Captain Joined: Jun 26, 2004 Posts: 5342 Location: England Posted: Wed Feb 02, 2005 10:59 pm Post subject: 512 RAM 2.66 Ghz CPU Nvidia 5200 Its ok for now, FPS gets quite low sometimes, but I'm going to upgrade soon anyway.  Probably going to get another 512 RAM to have a gig, and then a new Radeon 6800 graphics card. _________________ Jon Back to top Fire_Emblem_Master Chief Captain Joined: Oct 19, 2003 Posts: 2464 Location: Grand Rapids, MI Posted: Wed Feb 02, 2005 11:16 pm Post subject: 2GB RAM 2.8Ghz ATI RADEON X800XT Platinum Edition 256MB Back to top bawn Trainee Joined: Dec 15, 2004 Posts: 1 Posted: Wed Feb 02, 2005 11:24 pm Post subject: 512mb 3.4Gh P4 NVidia GeForce 6610XL Back to top Michael_H First Officer Joined: Mar 18, 2004 Posts: 389 Location: B.C.  Canada Posted: Wed Feb 02, 2005 11:32 pm Post subject: P4C 2.4 gig running at 2.66 gigs. 1024 mb PC3200 GForce Ti 4800 se. It runs very well,  no problems at all. It will fly big jets into busy airports day or night with lots of AI and keep up well over 20 fps (2X Anti aliasing)  which is more that adequate for smooth operation. I would really like a better video card though as this one is a bit weak when it comes to ground detail...
