      "text": "10/06/2002 Scuderia Ferrari Marlboro Has revised aerodynamic package for this circuit 1. Michael Schumacher Sunday: Fastest in warm-up but also suffered engine failure in spare car. Beaten into third place off the grid, moving up to second when Montoya stopped under the safety car. Inherited lead when leading teammate stopped on lap 26, now with 12s lead. Pitted and stopped for 11.4s on lap 38, dropped to second place and pushed by Raikkonen , retook lead when Montoya stopped on lap 51. Lead grew to 21s when Montoya retired on lap 57, but then eased up so victory by 1.1s. 1st Saturday: Fastest in both morning sessions. Engine very good in qualifying. Disappointed not to be able to fight for pole. Lost time on third run, his fastest. Didn't extract full potential from car. 2nd/1m 13.018s Friday: Glanced wall on outside of final chicane with right hand rear wheel towards end of morning session and pitted with broken wheel rim. Ran three sets of tyres as he worked on race set-up, determined not to leave anything for chance after last year's problems. 3rd/1m 15.788s 2. Rubens Barrichello Sunday: No major problems in warm-up. Good start, running two stop strategy and up to second place, then overtaking Montoya to lead lap one when Montoya runs wide. Opened up 4.3s when safety car came out. Then opened up gap to teammate, to 5.0s before pitting for 10.6s, longish to clean out side pods. Rejoined sixth, just behind Coulthard , but then dropped back. Moved up to third again with pit stops, but then stopped again on lap 54 in 5.8s, dropping to fourth, just behind Coulthard. Tried to overtake Coulthard on lap 61 when Coulthard delayed by slower car but ran over kerb in final chicane and then settled on third to the flag. 3rd Saturday: Went off onto grass at turns eight/nine and on regaining track, locked up brakes and slammed into wall, damaging right hand front wheel. Hit kerb and spun at turn three/four on third run in qualifying. Admitted playing catch-up for most of the day. 4th/1m 13.301s Friday: Fastest in morning session, then short cut chicane in afternoon session and suffered brake problems. Finds car well balanced. Need to find right settings now. 8th/1m 16.440s West McLaren Mercedes Slightly upgraded Mercedes V109 engine to be used on Saturday 3. David Coulthard Sunday: Routine warm-up although two off-track excursions. Moved up two places to sixth at the start, pushed by Heidfeld and Fisichella after safety car period, but then pulling away again, but struggling with oversteer. Pushed by Barrichello after the Ferrari driver's pit stop, but again pulled away. Made only pit stop on lap 49 in 9.2s, rejoining fourth which became third with Barrichello's second stop and second with Montoya's retirement. Nearly overtaken by Barrichello when delayed by Sato on lap 62, but pulled away. 2nd Saturday: Had a spin at turn eight in first part of morning session but rejoined. Had spin at the end of the session at the final corner in qualifying but able to rejoin. Felt qualifying 'horrible.' Hit traffic on first run and lost time. Second run affected by yellow flags due to Sato incident. Felt third row possible. 8th/1m 14.385s Friday: Had two brief offs in morning session. Problems trying various software options which did not quite work. Worked on race trim. Evaluated tyres, and tried to find the right balance. Still work to be done and can get more out of package. Finds grip level has improved. 1st/1m 15.407s 4. Kimi Raikkonen Continued on page 2 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | Next>"
