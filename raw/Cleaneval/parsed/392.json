      "text": "The European Commission has made it clear to all the Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs in the EU that there is no legal basis for a framework decision on mandatory data retention in the third pillar. The draft framework decision on data retention was introduced in April 2004 by the governments of France, the UK, Ireland and Sweden in an attempt to bypass the Commission, the European Parliament and even national parliaments. In the third pillar, the ministers may agree unanimously on a decision to harmonise legislation on police and justice matters, without any co-decision right for the European Parliament and a very limited margin for national parliaments to amend such a decision. In the proposal for data retention this margin is clearly defined. National parliaments may choose a different timeframe for the retention, but only if they review their decision annually and report to the Commission why they are still differing."

They will co-operate in investigating complaints about cross-border spam from anywhere within the EU, so as to make it easier to identify and prosecute spammers anywhere in Europe.\" There are still very few public hotlines in Europe where internet users can report spam. These hotlines usually only accept complaints about unsolicited e-mail originating in their own country. In that light, the promise of closer collaboration between European authorities seems a bit futile, if the final recipients of the mail, the Internet users, are not involved."

The European Commission gave Microsoft a record fine of 497 million euro after a five-year investigation by the Competition Commissioner into Microsoft's business practice. The Commission ordered Microsoft to offer a version of Windows without a bundled media player and to share more technical information with server rivals."

Only 1 MEP voted against the initiative, and 1 MEP was absent. The former French prime minister Michel Rocard gave an impressive speech in the JURI committee. With all respect for the new Commissioner for the internal market, Charlie McCreevy, he said he and other MEPs felt \"mustard was coming through their noses\". Afirst 'inelegance' Rocard noted was the fact that all the EP amendments in the first reading of the proposal had been ignored by Commission and Council. Secondly, the ministers of Germany and The Netherlands had ignored their own parliaments. Thirdly Rocard opposed the repeated attempts to adopt the proposal in the wrong forum of ministers, twice even at a Fishery Council. Rocard concluded his speech by explaining once more why the word 'technical' in the Council proposal couldn't help anybody distinguish between what is patentable and what is not."

      "text": "The rapporteur from the European Parliament on telecommunication data retention, Alexander Alvaro, has presented his first views on the draft framework decision in a turbulent meeting from the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). Alvaro proposed on 1 February 2005 to split the proposal in two, and give the European Parliament full co-decision power on the decision where it affects the internal market, on the costs and the exact list of data. Currently, the European Parliament only has a 'consultation' right on this issue. It cannot veto or amend the proposed decision, since it is considered third pillar legislation (police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters). Only the ministers from the EU member states can decide about these matters, if they reach unanimity. Alvaro doubts whether the proposal can ever meet the demands of proportionality when it comes to the Internet. He finds the proposal lacks proportionality, is in possible violation of the assumption of innocence, and contrary to the spirit of Article 15 of the E-Privacy Directive of 2002, which only allows for specific and temporary legal measures by member states, not for a harmonising decision. Concluding, he demanded a maximum term of 6 months, a limitation to data already processed by companies for business purposes and rules for general cost reimbursement."

This was decided as part of a proposed regulation, which was already due in late 2004, but was delayed until 7 January 2005. The delay seems to be due to technical problems with stacking multiple RFIDs on documents. The upcoming Luxembourg Presidency of the Council wrote a note on these technical difficulties on 22 December 2004. The note mentions in particular collision problems arising when several RFID tags would be included in one passport. As a possible solution concerning visas, the note proposes to store the biometric data only in the VIS and not on an RFID sticker, and says a majority of EU member states delegations seems to be in favour of this second solution. Concerning residence permits, the Luxembourg Presidency proposes to issue separate cards, with the biometric data on an RFID chip, as is currently planned also for EU citizens' travel documents. This solution is, however, opposed by Germany, where residence permits are already being issued in the form of stickers."

The contracts are said to offer an adequate level of data protection under the EU's data protection laws. Companies can use the clauses to provide a legal basis for transfers to data controllers outside of Europe as from 1 April 2005. The new clauses will be added to those already available under the Commission's June 2001 decision (IP/01/851). Companies believe that some of the new clauses, such as those on litigation, allocation of responsibilities or auditing requirements, are more business-friendly. According to the Commission the new clauses provide for a similar level of data protection as those of 2001 and prevent abuses, the data protection authorities are given more powers to intervene and impose sanctions where necessary. The implementation of this new set of clauses will be reviewed in 2008."
