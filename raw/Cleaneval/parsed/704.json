Currently, a public beta release of the \nsystem is under study. The principal researcher in Kalas is Martin Svensson. RIND, Recommendations and Adaptation of content in New Domains, investigates \nhow a con guration system can be enhanced with recommendations and adaptive user \ninterfaces, to support the user when con guring a complex product. RIND is a 6 \nmonths project funded by Vinnova, and ends in December 2001. \nPrincipal researchers are   Asa Rudstrom, Rickard Cster and Tomas Olsson. CoPIR (Collaborative Information Seeking and Retrieval)addresses the problem of \nsupporting workgroup interaction and collaboration in professional information \nseeking and retrieval. The project ends in December 2001 and is  nanced by Vinnova. \nPrincipal investigator is Preben Hansen."

      "text": "In a typical online grocery store, there will be 10.000 different products to choose from. \nNavigating such a space is not only time-consuming but can also be boring and tedious. \nSome users will have more difficulties than others to efficiently make use of the existing \nonline stores. In a study on an existing hypertext based online store, it was show \nthat elderly users spent in average twice as much time finding items on a \nshopping list than did younger users. In both age categories, users \nsometimes completely gave up when searching for certain items."

      "text": "It has been shown that on-line food shoppers do not gain any time from \nshopping food online, instead they appreciate flexibility in time and \nspace. Shoppers feel that they can avoid the tedious, boring, food \nstores, but they loose the sensuous pleasures of seeing, touching and \nsmelling the products. This is somewhat compensated by getting status among friends from being able to tell stories about how they shop food \nonline. In a study by Richmond on shopping in a virtual reality environment, \nit was found that users also want to be able to access the social aspects \nof a physical store, they want to socialise with other people. Given the problems with navigation and the lack of social interaction \nand sensuous pleasures in the existing online grocery stores, the domain \nshould be an excellent application example for social navigation techniques."

      "text": "Filtering : A couple of user studies show that history-enriched \nenvironments and recommender systems might help filter out the most relevant \ninformation from a large information space. Quality : Sometimes it is not enough that the information obtained \nis relevant, it must also possess qualities that can only be determined \nfrom how other users reacts to it (the social texture discussed in the \nintroduction). Only when an expert verifies that a piece of information \nis valid, or when a piece of art is often referred to in the literature, \nwill it be of high quality in the eyes of a navigator. Social affordance : Visible actions of other users can inform us \nwhat is appropriate behaviour, what can or cannot be done. At the same time, \nthis awareness of others and their actions makes us feel that the space is \nalive and might make it more inviting. Here the focus is not on whether \nusers navigate more efficiently, or find exactly what they need more \nquickly; instead, the intent is to make them stay longer in the space, \nfeel more relaxed, and perhaps be inspired to try out new functionality,\nto pick up new products and new information items, or to try out new services\nthat they would not have considered otherwise. Users can quickly pick up on the\n\"norms\" for how to behave when they see others behaviours. Usage reshapes functionality and structure : Social navigation design \nmay alter the organisation of the space. In amazon.com, the structure of \nthe space experienced by visitors is changed: one can follow the \nrecommendations instead of navigating by the search-for-terms structure. \nSocial navigation thus could be a first step towards empowering users to, \nin a natural subtle way, make the functionality and structure \"drift\" and \nmake our information spaces more \"fluid\"\nOf course, social navigation comes with a price. The major drawbacks \nwith social navigation are related to the fact that users has to be visible \nand that it (in many situations) relies on a large user population: Privacy : Since social navigation relies on the visibility\nof people and their actions, people have to give up some of their \nprivacy. In what circumstances are people willing to do this and to \nwhat extent? There is also indications of that the importance of privacy \nis highly individual. Some users are willing to share almost anything about \nthemselves, whilst others want to be totally invisible. Bootstrapping : Since social navigation systems often rely on\nthe accumulated users behaviour, such as, trails of where people have gone and\nrecommender systems, they will work poorly when little information has been\ncollected. Is it possible to find techniques that somewhat overcome this\nproblem by, for instance, using other strategies to recommend in an early stage\nof the systems lifecycle? Snowball effects : At the other end of the bootstrapping problem\nwe face another problem. When more and more people walks down the \n\"wrong\" path this will be indicated as a \"good\" path in a typical social \nnavigation system. To what extent is it possible to detect and deal with \nthese wrong paths? Concept drift : Over time people and information change. What\nwas interesting to me yesterday may be totally irrelevant today. Recommender\nsystems tend to get \"conservative\" in the sense that once they have a user\nprofile it is very difficult to change it. In order for social navigation to be\nreally successful it has to take into consideration that peoples' interests\nchange and that different types of information have different expiration\ndates."
