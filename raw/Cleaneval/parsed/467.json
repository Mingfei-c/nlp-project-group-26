      "text": "Slavery in the\r\nAncient Greek World: An Objective Approach to the Matter by Evangelos\r\nMbeksis Part I 1. Stewards and\r\ndomestics in the Mycenaean period So much has been\r\nwritten about slavery in ancient Greece that one feels one is bringing\r\n\"blue skies to Athens\" by contributing even\r\nmore (1) . However, if we consider the question using strictly historical\r\ncriteria -- thereby freeing ourselves from opinions based upon the later\r\ndevelopment of the institution -- we may then be able to begin to form a\r\ndifferent view of this matter than the one we may now have. The first word,\r\ntherefore, which characterizes that which will later come to be called slavery,\r\nis thms, for the male, and thmos for\r\nthe female . This translates in current usage as \" person of the\r\nhouse . \" As an example, Homer informs us that Lartes, the father of\r\nOdysseus, has male servants to tend his orchard and garden, as well as an old\r\nwoman to care for him . His son's palace has 50 female servants, whose\r\nmost arduous physical labor is the grinding of flour . The head thmos [stewardess] may have the keys to the storerooms and complete authority over\r\nthe other servants . Goatherds, farm workers, those who work as craftsmen,\r\nas well as charioteers, horse trainers, and others, give us a picture of a\r\ncommunity of people who --  because each had his or her special place in Mycenaean\r\nsociety -- could in no way be characterized as inferior . This is the\r\ninescapable conclusion one comes to after a careful reading of the Iliad and the Odyssey , where one can't help but notice that the behavior of the\r\nmale and female servants toward their freeborn masters, and the way\r\ntheir masters interact with them, never gives the reader the\r\nslightest hint of their relatively inferior positions. The bondman or\r\nhouse servant, therefore, represents an active member of the Mycenaean oikognia [\"family,\" normally under the protection of a patriarch] . One\r\nmight even say that what we've been describing represents a rudimentary form of\r\nadoption, which commences as soon as the servant is brought into the household . Not uncommonly, bonds of affection often develop between the master and the slave, which we see characterized, as an example, in the Homeric\r\nepics . In the Odyssey , Anticla [Odysseus' mother], the mistress of the\r\npalace, treats the young slave Eumaus as her own son . He is nurtured\r\nalongside and in the same way as the daughter of the household, Ctimne . When\r\nhe grows to young manhood, she worries about his safety and well-being . And\r\nwhen Anticla dies, her daughter-in-law, Penelope, assumes the responsibility\r\nof his protection . She also takes on the upbringing and care of the daughter of\r\nDlius, her own old and faithful servant . When the suitors\r\ntake over Odysseus' palace, bringing with them a tense and worrisome\r\natmosphere, Eumaus bemoans the diminishment of the tenderness and\r\ndedication to which he had become so accustomed . As we read in the Odyssey , he complains : \"Now everything is gone . If the gods\r\nhave allowed me, through my labor, to accomplish something in my life ; if I have\r\nfood to eat and wine to drink, it is as nothing to me because I can no longer\r\nhear the sweet voice of my master, or the tender affections shown me by my\r\nmistress.\" Also touching, is\r\nthe fact that when Odysseus returns to Ithaka the first people he turns to for\r\nhelp are not his freeborn friends and fellow archons, but his slaves, Eumaus, Philotius, Dlius, and the six sons of\r\nDlius . The same is true with the\r\nfemale slaves of the palace, of whom only twelve, from a total of fifty, have\r\ndeserted to the suitors in spite of the many long years that their master has\r\nbeen away . All\r\nthe rest, as soon as they see him, \"... surround him, taking him by the\r\nhand, and greeting him warmly . And he, feeling a great emotion welling up\r\nin his chest, tries to control a sweet desire to shed tears of joy, for in his\r\nheart he recognizes each and every one of them.\" But let us return\r\nto Eumaus, a typical herdsman and slave of the Mycenaean age . We see\r\nthat he lives independently at some distance from the palace . He has his\r\nown bread, barley flour, and wine in goodly quantities . He slaughters as\r\nmany of the animals in his charge as he desires and whenever he chooses, for\r\nhimself and his visitor . He wears a well-formed tunic, good sandals,\r\nand has two cloaks of wild goatskin ; one for good weather, and a heavier\r\none for when it rains . He has a sturdy house of stone, with a\r\nhallway, portico, fireplace, and enough room to allow him to offer hospitality\r\nto guests . Most important of all, over time, and with no outside help,\r\nhe's been able to purchase his own slave using his own money . He even has\r\nthe right to be armed, as we see in the Odyssey when he offers Odysseus\r\nthe hospitality of his home and stands guard outside with a sword and javelin\r\nwhile his guest is sleeping. Even Odysseus'\r\nfather, old Lartes, can often be found sleeping by the fireplace in the\r\npalace, on the floor, along with the household slaves . So we see -- going\r\nall the way back to the time when we have the first written accounts on the\r\nsubject of slavery in ancient Greece -- that it can in no way be compared to how\r\nthe institution developed in later periods and in other lands. 2.  Slavery in the classical period Let us see what\r\ndevelops later on . In the ensuing years the terms thms and thmos evolve into oiktys and oiktis , because they came into the\r\nhome [ ikos ] and became a member, or pas [child], of the\r\nfamily, which attests to the tenderness with which they were surrounded . When an oiktys first entered a home, the mistress of the house gave him figs,\r\nwalnuts, and other such tidbits to eat, in order to let him know that from that\r\ntime on his life would be sweet and full of good fortune . Slaves took part in\r\nall of the religious holidays, and even participated in the Great Mysteries,\r\nsuch as those which honored Demeter and Persephne at Eleusis . Also, on\r\nthe first day of the Anthestrion in Athens, and the Iaknthian in Sparta, as\r\nwell as at other festivals in Arcadia, the slaves sat at the same tables\r\nwith their masters, and were therefore referred to as omphagoi [dinner\r\ncompanions] . At Epdauros, the temple to Athena belonged to the slaves,\r\nand the Great Priest of this holy shrine had to be a runaway slave, who was also\r\na fierce fighter as well . The slave in a home took part in all of the\r\nreligious observances of the household, and participated in the holidays which\r\nwere held sacred by the family . At his death, he would be buried in the\r\nfamily tomb. Should a slave\r\nsuffer bad treatment at the hands of his master, he had the right to seek\r\nsanctuary at certain sacred places, such as the Temple of Thesus in Athens, or\r\nthe Temple of the Ernyes, located beneath the Hill of Ares, and\r\nlegally claim the right to be sold to another master . A decision of the court was\r\nrequired for a slave to be put to death . There were also special laws\r\ngoverning the rights and treatment of slaves besides that of sanctuary : Xena [hospitality, which forbade mistreatment], specific laws having to do with their\r\nprotection, and a law which granted them the right to own property, called ngtisis [possession of property in a foreign country] . The murder of a slave\r\ncarried the same punishment as the murder of a freeborn citizen, and from the\r\ntime of Solon [the great Athenian lawgiver], the beating or ill-treatment of\r\na slave was punishable by law. As for the talents\r\nand capabilities of slaves, we know, first of all, that many were competent\r\ndoctors : practitioners who were trained along with some of the great\r\nphysicians of the ancient Greek world . This became such a common phenomenon\r\nthat the [Roman] emperor Domition, in the first century A.D., imposed a law\r\nforbidding the medical training of slaves because they had become too numerous . Ermppos, the [one-eyed Athenian] writer of comedies of the second century\r\nA.D., even wrote a book about all of the distinguished authors of his time who\r\nwere slaves . Some of these were Pmpylos, Persios, Ms, and Mnimos,\r\nphilosophers and slaves of Theophrstus, Znon, Epicrus, and\r\nlastly, a banker from Corinth respectively . The Stoic philosopher, Epicttus, who\r\nlived and flourished in the first century A.D., was not only born a slave in\r\nPhrygia, but was disabled as well . The philosopher Phedo [in whose\r\nhonor Plato named his famous dialogue], was brought to Athens as a slave, became\r\na devout student of Socrates after gaining his freedom, and ultimately opened\r\nhis own school of philosophy in Elis . Mnippus, of Gadara, in Syria [3rd century\r\nB.C.], was a slave who was brought to Greece where he became wealthy . After\r\nbuying his freedom, he studied philosophy and eventually became the originator of the serio-comic style [ spouthoglion ]\r\nof writing, authoring a total of thirteen books . Bion, the\r\nBorysthenite [4th/3rd centuries B.C.], was the slave of a rich rhetorician who, when\r\nhe died, left everything to him . Bion had already received an excellent\r\neducation provided for him by his master . After his master's death, he\r\nmoved to Athens where he studied philosophy at the Perpatos (under\r\nTheophrstus) and the Academy (under Xenocrtes) . He became a famous\r\nCynic philosopher, and his writings later strongly influenced Roman satire. Slaves were to be\r\nfound in\r\nmany professions, trades, and crafts . From the ancient rhetoricians,\r\nwe learn that they worked as metallurgists, rope makers, pharmacists, iron\r\nworkers, musical instrument makers, roof tile craftsmen, cooks, and even civil\r\nservants . From a catalogue which names 66 recently freed slaves, together\r\nwith the work they did before gaining their freedom, we find farmers, merchants\r\nof flax, salt meat, vegetables, incense, and sesame . There were middle-men, shop keepers,\r\ngoldsmiths, cobblers, foundry workers, lead and silver molders, metal workers,\r\nscribes, legal secretaries, engravers, and others. As we mentioned\r\nabove, slaves also worked for the state as civil servants . These were\r\ndivided into two categories : laborers and clerks . Life for the\r\nclerks was much better than it was for the laborers . As \"office\r\nworkers\" for the state, they had the right to live in their own homes with\r\ntheir own furnishings . They could accumulate wealth, which became part of\r\ntheir personal estate . They were free to marry and to raise their children . They took part in the sacred ceremonies and processions of their respective\r\ncities . One such clerk, whose name has come down to us, was Pittalkos, who lived a prosperous life and would frequent the courts of Athens\r\nlike a freeborn citizen . The city police [ astinmi ] were also civil servants . In Athens, these were comprised of\r\nScythian bowmen who policed all of the residents of the polis [city],\r\nincluding the freeborn citizens and the voulefts [members of\r\nparliament] . These Scythians were slaves, and were employed by the city,\r\nas were the guardians of public buildings, and the inspectors of weights and\r\nmeasures in the public markets . The majority of the town heralds,\r\nconstables, and clerks of the city courts and accounting departments were slaves . Those whose responsibility included the guarding of the treasury of the\r\narmed forces were slaves, as were most of those who kept and guarded the\r\nofficial archives of the city . At the Pnyx (2) ,\r\nslave civil servants sat directly behind the President, ready to provide him\r\nwith the text of some relevant law or ruling pertaining to the matter under\r\nconsideration . In fact, when it was decided that a revision of the law codes\r\nof Athens needed to be done, the responsibility for this important task was\r\nentrusted to a civil servant by the name of Nicmachus, a slave, who, as chief\r\narchivist of the courts, was the man most qualified for the job. 3.  The\r\nEconomic condition of the slaves Another very\r\nimportant category of slaves was that of the \"undomiciled\" [ xors\r\nokountes ], that is, those slaves who lived and worked independently, and\r\nwho kept their wages or profits  for themselves (except for a small\r\nfee -- usually one or two obols (3) a day -- which was\r\npaid to their \"master\") . These slaves had all of the rights and\r\nprivileges of the aforementioned civil servants : economic independence, a\r\nfamily, and a home of their own . We are fortunate here, because the names\r\nand histories of some of these individuals have come down to us . One\r\nsuch, is Phormon, the right hand man of the banker, Pason, a slave himself\r\nwho, after gaining his freedom, went on to become the wealthiest banker and\r\nmanufacturer in Athens (we will say more about these two anon) . We also\r\nknow that Tmarchus (4) allowed his slaves to operate a\r\nshoe-making factory as a partnership, requiring only that he be paid a fee of\r\ntwo obols per day for each worker, and three obols per day for the chief\r\ncraftsman . And that another slave of the household of the Athenian\r\nChrysippus was the manager of a branch of the factory located on the Bosporus. From what has been\r\nwritten so far, we can -- for Athenian society at least --come to the general\r\nconclusion that we are dealing here with a very vibrant and\r\nimportant slave presence in the productive, agricultural, industrial, civil, and\r\neconomic life of the city . The only field in which we do not see a strong\r\nparticipation by slaves is in the armed forces in general, and in the navy in\r\nparticular -- except in times of dire necessity, such as at the sea-battle of\r\nArginsae in 406 B.C.-- (5), and it is only proper that\r\none wonder why this was so . Surely it wasn't because of a lack of trust\r\nin their loyalty, for we've seen that they were entrusted with many key\r\npositions in the Athenian community . Besides, mercenaries and metics (6) were used as oarsmen in the navy, along with the poorest citizens, so why were\r\nslaves not used as well? Nor was it because the work of a thrantas (7) was thought to be too arduous (especially when\r\ncompared to that of a clerk, a bank employee, or a craftsman) . Why then,\r\nsince there are those who are anxious to convince us that the ancient Greeks\r\nmistreated their slaves, did they not use them in the dangerous and laborious\r\njob of oarsmen in the Athenian fleet? The answer is strictly economic, and has\r\nto do with the fact that, in the period under consideration, the Athenian\r\ncitizen underclass was suffering from severe economic hardship . Some were\r\nliterally starving, in contrast to the large population of resident slaves who\r\nhad a virtual monopoly on commerce and the marketplace, and service as an oarsman in the navy\r\nrepresented the  \"last refuge\" from economic deprivation for the lowest\r\nclasses of the freeborn poor. In this way, a thrantas earning from 3 to 6 obols a day (8) could feed his family . It was, in other words, the one sure way of finding gainful employment at a\r\ntime when most of the other professions and trades were in the hands of either\r\nthe slaves or the metics . And to make the tragic state of the Athenian\r\ncitizen-poor even clearer, it is enough to relate that, after the defeat of the\r\nAthenians in the Lamian War of 322 B.C., of the 31,000 freeborn Athenian\r\nsoldiers who took part, 22,000 lost their civil rights as citizens because their\r\nnet worth had fallen below the qualifying threshold of 2000 drachmas . We\r\nknow as well, that in the 5th century B.C. large numbers of Athenian citizens\r\nwere forced by dire necessity, and under very difficult conditions, to become klruchs in various Athenian kleroucha (9) ,\r\nfar from their native city . On the other hand, when we look at the\r\nfortunes of the wealthiest citizens of Athens in the 4th century B.C., we see\r\nthat the wealth of Demosthenes, the famous orator, did not exceed 14 talents (10), whereas the \"slave,\" Pason, was worth between 75 to 80\r\ntalents upon his death, and only Dphilus, with 160 talents, and Epicrtes\r\nwith 600, exceeded Pason in wealth. But let us take a\r\ncloser look at Pason . It is not clear whether he bought or rented the\r\nbank of his former employer . Soon after taking it over, however, Pason\r\nwas sued by a client for misuse of funds amounting to about 7 talents . Not\r\nonly was Pason exonerated, he never lost the confidence of his many depositors . Besides being the owner of a bank, Pason also owned a factory where\r\nhe manufactured shields . He was a generous donor to good causes, and in\r\n376 B.C. even became an Athenian citizen . It was then that he began to\r\ninvest heavily in real estate . He loaned the Athenian strategs [commander],\r\nTimotheus, money for the needs of the fleet in 373/372 B.C., and even equipped\r\nfive ships himself . As we mentioned above, at his death his net worth was\r\nestimated to be between 75 to 80 talents, a colossal amount of money in those\r\ndays . It is interesting to note that when he retired he leased his bank\r\nand his shield manufactory to his slave, Phormon, for 10,000 and 6,000\r\ndrachmas [per year] respectively. But this begs the\r\nquestion : Where did Phormon, a slave, find such large sums of money in\r\norder to be able to pay off his \"master,\" Pason? And these two are not the\r\nonly slaves to become prominent bankers . We know of others as well, like\r\nKtto, Evmthi, Socrates [not the philosopher], Timdemos, and Stiros, all\r\nof whom also married the widows of their former \"masters,\" as did\r\nPhormon . On the other side of the coin, regarding those who earned\r\ntheir bread by working for it by the \"sweat of their brow,\" we offer\r\nthe following information : In 408 B.C., in a survey of 55 different\r\nmanual trades, only 36% were being performed by citizens ; in 328 B.C., of 74 such trades, 27% were being performed by citizens ; and in Eleuss [about 20 miles from Athens], in 329/328 B.C., of 94 trades\r\nsurveyed, only 21% were in the hands of citizens . From a listing of 27\r\ncontractors and small business employers from the same period, we see only 9\r\ncitizens, or 33% of the total . Another list of a total of 41 merchants,\r\nshows only11 citizens,\r\nor 27% ; and from 15 bidders [for public works projects] we find only 2\r\ncitizens, or 13%. So that the Athenian citizens not only had to compete against the slaves and\r\ntheir freeborn compatriots, they had also to contend with the very tough competition of\r\nthe metics . One can easily see that they were confronted with a\r\ndead-end situation as regards the ways and means by which they were able to earn\r\na living . The only fields in which freeborn citizens formed the majority\r\nwere those of keepers of flocks and herds, animal husbandry, mule and oxcart\r\ntransport, exporters of asbestos, the armed forces, and in the manufacture of\r\nbricks and tiles . All other means of livelihood in the economy were in\r\nthe hands of the metics,  slaves, and slaves who'd been manumitted . These\r\nslaves and former slaves slowly but steadily came to dominate the marketplace\r\ncompletely, eventually replacing even the metics, who began to withdraw from the\r\nmanual trades in order to seek other means of earning a steadier, easier, more\r\ndependable living . The result was a dramatic decrease in their numbers\r\nafter 355 B.C. But in the period\r\nunder consideration here, we see that it's the metics, slaves and former slaves\r\nwho, having little or nothing to lose, are the entrepreneurs . They are\r\nthe ones who engage in the kind of high-risk ventures that, when successful, are\r\nthe most profitable . On the other hand, the freeborn citizens stick\r\nmostly to those activities that are less profitable but not as risky . What\r\ncounts most for the freeborn is to not lose their land, and so we witness the\r\ncitizens of this period staying away from commercial initiatives that entail\r\nputting venture capital at risk . So that a situation develops where, 1)\r\nthe metics and the slaves -- not having any ties at all with the land of Attica\r\n-- predominate in the arena of commerce, together with an ever-shrinking\r\nresidual of extremely rich Athenian citizens who are \"hanging on.\" 2) The aforementioned \"undomiciled\" slaves are able to command good\r\nsalaries as independent agents, or as \"rented-out\" craftsmen. And 3)\r\nthe vast majority of the population, comprised mainly of poor Athenian citizens,\r\nstruggle for their daily bread, and, if there is no other recourse, hire out as\r\nday laborers for the slaves and metics, who are supposedly their\r\n\"inferiors.\" So that we have,\r\nfor example, the citizen Ameinas, a basket maker, who must sell his baskets\r\nfor a measly one drachma apiece [thereby barely scraping out a living], while in\r\nthe shop next door, the metic Phlon, an iron merchant, does a land-office\r\nbusiness . Or Ditrephis, a citizen demolition contractor, who, because\r\nhe is desperate for work, agrees to a contract for a mere 45 drachmas, for which\r\nsum he has to provide the scaffolding, whereas the metic Philokls asks 300\r\ndrachmas just for the excavation . Demosthenes, in his public orations,\r\ntalks about how not a single one of the rich ship owners, ship chandlers, or\r\nwealthy bankers who ever asked for his help in defending against one legal\r\nmatter or another, was an Athenian citizen by birth . It seems, then,\r\nthat most Athenian citizens had to figure out how to get by on their\r\n\"political rights,\" and their land . So much had the ownership\r\nof land become tied to the conception of Athenian citizenship, that, in 403\r\nB.C., a law was actually introduced which, had it passed, would have limited the\r\nprivilege only to those who were landowners . This is why all those who\r\nwere able to achieve citizenship rushed to buy land immediately (like Pason,\r\nwho, as soon as he became a citizen, spent the enormous sum of 20 talents on\r\nland purchases) . Or Artistophnes [not the famous comic playwright], who\r\nbought 255 strmmata (11) . We also\r\nhave the example of [the painter?] Polygntus, who refused payment for his\r\nwork, asking that he be granted citizenship instead.

There was, however, one very\r\nimportant condition : he was obligated by law to teach them a trade . Compliance\r\nwith this condition required the expenditure of a sizable amount of money over and\r\nabove the original purchase price . To ensure compliance, there were some very\r\nstringent laws in place that provided for punishment and fines for those who\r\nkept an unemployed slave ( tholon argn ) . We remember the\r\nexample of Xenophnes [the philosopher of Magna Graecia] who, when asked by\r\nHiron [the tyrant of Syracuse] to tell him how many slaves he owned, replied : \"Two, and I am struggling to keep them fed.\" From\r\nthe above we can safely conclude that this form of \"rudimentary\r\nadoption\" required a certain degree of financial capability, not only for\r\nthe day-to-day upkeep, but for the long term expenses as well . A\r\nfinancial capability that may well have been within the reach of a middle class\r\ncitizen as far as the original purchase price was concerned, but over the years,\r\nwith the ever-increasing competition from the metics and the freed slaves,\r\ntogether with the reduction of the value of land caused by pillage and\r\ninterminable wars, this capability was constricted more and more . To the\r\npoint, in many instances, where the citizen-owner was forced to either rent out\r\nhis slaves, allow them to set up on their own in order to reduce his costs, or,\r\nas a last resort, manumit them . Should one wonder just what kind of\r\nadvantages a citizen-owner could expect from manumitting a slave, we can think\r\nof two that come immediately to mind : 1) his expenses were reduced because\r\nhe was no longer responsible for the slave's care and feeding, and 2) he\r\nreceived\r\na significant sum of money in the form of either a lump sum payment or a steady income\r\nover time, as consideration for granting the slave's freedom . The\r\nprocess of manumission is executed either by the slave himself, or by an agent\r\nhired by the slave to negotiate and/or make payment to his master, thereby\r\nattaining his freedom . In most city-states, the ceremony of freeing a\r\nslave was performed according to traditional formulaic rituals, either in front\r\nof or inside a temple . The record of the procedure was then inscribed\r\nupon an interior wall of the temple for future reference . In Athens,\r\nhowever, the whole process was usually carried out in the law court or at the\r\ntheater, by the making of a verbal or written proclamation stating the name of\r\nthe slave about to be manumitted . The freeborn citizen had another\r\nadvantage, which was that should the manumitted slave die without heirs, his or\r\nher estate would revert back to the former master . The manumission of a\r\nslave without some form of monetary or other consideration was a very rare thing\r\nindeed . Therefore, we can conclude that in order to purchase their\r\nfreedom under the conditions imposed by custom and law, slaves had to have some\r\nmeans of obtaining a steady income . 4. \r\nVocations and conditions of life of the slaves Let\r\nus return now to the vocations which -- for the most part -- separated the\r\nfreeborn citizens from the slaves . We do this to bolster our argument\r\nthat the citizens were deeply and emotionally attached to the land, and were\r\nstruggling hard to keep it, because they had lost ground in all other areas of\r\nthe economy to the metics and freed slaves . Therefore, the possession of land was,\r\neither by custom or law, the essence and source of their right to proudly claim\r\nthe title of freeborn citizens . To make our point, we submit the\r\nfollowing facts about the situation existing in the agricultural areas of\r\nGreece. In\r\nthe 5th century B.C., there were no slaves in Central Greece [within which lies\r\nthe \"breadbasket\" of the country] . In Pltaea [a city in\r\nsouthern Boeota], in 431 B.C., the city was unable to muster a contingent of\r\n110 female slaves . By the 4th century, slaves in Boeota comprised 1/3rd\r\nof the total population . In Locris and Phocis [both in Central Greece],\r\nslavery was virtually unknown prior to the Persian attack in 480 B.C . And\r\nin Attica [the province within which Athens is located], not a purely agrarian\r\narea, the number of slaves working the land was minimal . Among a\r\ngroup of convicted lawbreakers in 451 B.C., whose estates had been forfeit and\r\nsold at auction, only one owned 16 slaves : a metic from Piraeus, whose\r\noffense was to violate the law forbidding him to own land . All of the\r\nrest, whose land and crops -- either standing in the fields or already harvested\r\nand in warehouses -- had no more than one or two slaves . In a\r\ncatalogue of 131 manumitted [Athenian] slaves, not one of the 62 women mentioned\r\nhad worked on a farm prior to being freed . Of the 69 men, there are only\r\n7 who worked on the land as gardeners, and 2 who worked in the vineyards . On\r\nthe other hand, in those areas that were more inclined toward commerce or light\r\nindustry, slaves not only made up the majority, but outnumbered even the metics\r\nand the freeborn citizens . So that in 309 B.C., after the census of\r\nDemetrius of Phlerum, we get the following results : freeborn citizens,\r\n21,000 ; metics, 10,000 ; slaves, 400,000 . On the island of\r\nAgina [in the Saronic Gulf, near Athens], the number of slaves approached\r\n460,000 souls, whereas in Corinth 470,000 . And on the island of Chios [in\r\nthe Northern Aegean], there were many more than on Agina or in Corinth, though\r\nwe don't have precise figures. Let\r\nus look now at the salaries paid to slaves and freeborn . In 325 B.C., the\r\n9 archons of Athens [the chief magistrates and office holders of the State],\r\nwere each paid 4 obols a day, while, during the same period, the State paid\r\nskilled slave craftsmen at the rate of 3 obols per day, plus meals . In\r\n325, members of parliament [ voul ], received 5 obols per day, whereas\r\njurors [ heliaiasts ] got 3 . We take note, therefore, that in the\r\n4th century B.C., a slave received an equal salary with a freeborn juror, and a\r\nslightly lower salary than a magistrate or a member of parliament . Any\r\ncomparison with more modern times regarding this issue is sure to leave us with\r\nmany questions pertaining to the definition of the word \"slave,\" then\r\nand now (1). We\r\nfurther take note that in 400 B.C., a family of 3, together with their 2 slaves,\r\nhad a yearly expenditure of 1000 drachmas, whereas, in 370 B.C., the young\r\nDemsthenes, with his mother and sister, and with no slaves, needed 700\r\ndrachmas per year . When we factor in an estimate of the increase in the\r\ncost of living which took place in the intervening 30 years, we find that\r\nthe slaves -- in both periods -- averaged a daily salary of about 3 obols, which\r\nwas naturally paid them by their owner . This applied to leased slaves as\r\nwell, where the freeborn citizen was also required to provide food, lodging,\r\nclothing, etc., for the slave during the term of the lease . So that we\r\nhave -- in the 4th century B.C. -- domestic, leased, and publicly owned slaves\r\nearning a steady and secure wage amounting to about 3 obols per day . If\r\nwe add in the cost of clothing, feeding, and housing, we see that their\r\nactual salaries amounted to even more. From\r\nAristphanes' great comedy, \"Pltus\" [\"Wealth\"],\r\nperformed in 380 B.C., we learn that shoes cost 8 drachmas and himations (2) cost 20 . In 330 B.C., shoes for slaves cost 6 drachmas, and the chiton (3) worn by slaves cost as much as 7 . We must also add the cost of\r\nmedical treatment for the slave, as well as the cost of teaching him a trade, as\r\nwas required by law . From all of the above, it is abundantly clear that\r\nit was entirely possible -- if not probable -- that there would come a time when\r\na middle class Athenian citizen with a low income, who wished to maintain a\r\nslave in accordance with law and custom, ran a real risk of dropping\r\nprecipitously to the status of the \"newly poor,\" because in order to\r\ndo so he would probably have to mortgage his land, in which case he ran the risk\r\nof losing both his land and his most prized possession of all : that of\r\ncitizen of Athens, as we've already seen happen after the defeat of Athens in\r\nthe Lamian War of 322 B.C. As a result, we see that year after year there are\r\nmore and more slaves manumitted by an ever greater number of middle class\r\nAthenian citizens . Either that, or they were subjugated to the State, metics,\r\nor wealthy Athenians who could afford them . They were also leased out to\r\ncommercial or small industrial interests at an ever increasing rate . It\r\nis during this period that the slave essentially becomes strictly a household\r\nservant of the wealthier families of Athens . Actually, things have not\r\nchanged that much down through the centuries : The main differences being that the Athenian slave had much better future possibilities, more\r\nrespect, more rights, and better [weighted] monetary compensation than the serfs\r\nof the Middle Ages and Czarist Russia, the slaves of the ante-bellum American\r\nSouth, or the \"wage slaves\" of more recent times. Let\r\nus turn now to the much-heralded and much-bemoaned slaves who worked in the\r\nmines of Larium (4) . The importance of\r\nthese mines (right through to about 370 B.C.) was negligible after the revolt of the\r\nmetal-working slaves which took place during the last few years of the Peloponnesian\r\nWar . In all of that time, right from the end of the war in 404 B.C.,\r\nno major Athenian venture capitalist saw fit to invest in these mines . Add\r\nto this the fact that only a small number of poor Athenian citizens worked there\r\nfor their own benefit -- which indicates to us that production had fallen a\r\ngreat deal -- and we can understand why there was a crisis at the mines at this\r\ntime, and why the whole operation was in a very bad state. When\r\nconsidering that the majority of the slaves working in the mines were leased,\r\nthat the freeborn mine operators were paying a minimum of 1 obol per day to their\r\nmasters, and that they had the further expense of clothing and feeding their\r\ncharges -- in addition to which they had to contend with a general economic\r\ndepression in the Athenian economy due to Athens' defeat in the aforementioned\r\nwar -- we can see why the wages of the slaves at Larium were not up to par . We then come to realize that the revolt was not due to any ill-treatment of\r\nthe slaves, but was most likely the result of the slaves coming to the\r\nconclusion that, considering the arduous labor involved, working in the metal mines was not a profitable enough\r\noccupation . This realization is\r\nstrengthened by the later indifference on the part of the venture capitalists to\r\ncontinue operations in Larium, which allowed the poor citizens of Athens to\r\ncome in and try to scratch out a living . It is not until 367 B.C. that\r\nactivity at the mines is revived, only to peak at around 350 B.C., after which\r\ntime there is a steady decline . All of which begs the question : Why\r\nweren't there any revolts during the many years that the mines were productive\r\nunder Athenian hegemony? The answer is simple : it was because during this\r\nperiod the slaves were content and satisfied. As\r\nregards the laws governing the rights of the slaves, we can add the following : Slaves could appear as plaintiffs in an action against their masters who\r\nwere forced to appear to defend themselves . They had the legal right, as\r\npreviously mentioned, to have their own money . However, although they were not\r\nsubject to\r\nmonetary fines when they broke certain laws, they could suffer corporal\r\npunishment instead . In Athens, a slave's master did not have the right to\r\ntake his life . A slave who suffered abuse and who sought sanctuary had\r\nthe right to be sold to another master . For these and other reasons we\r\nread the following lines in the Hecuba by Euripides : \"For\r\nyou Greeks, both the free man and slave are protected by the same laws governing\r\nhomicide.\" What is important here is that old Queen Hecuba is not talking about\r\nAthenians only, but of all Greeks, which tends to indicate that there was a\r\ncommon, pan-Hellenic code of behavior toward slaves in place at that time . Also,\r\nan Athenian who murders his slave is ostracized from the city, a fate considered to\r\nbe worse than the death penalty . To\r\ncontinue with the rights that a slave enjoyed, we see that there were no\r\nrestrictions which told him how to dress ; as a result, he looked\r\nno different from a freeborn Athenian working man on the street or in the agora . He could speak freely\r\non any subject, sometimes even verbally abusing his listeners, as anyone who has\r\nread Greek comedy can verify . The Athenians and all Greeks relied upon their slaves\r\nto fulfill the important role of teachers [ paidagogs ] to their children . Demosthenes, in his Against Meidias , talks about a law which refers\r\nanyone who \"corrupts the morals of a child, woman, freeborn man, or\r\nslave by committing an illegal act against their person\" to the\r\nAssembly [ Heliaia ] for trial . Demosthenes goes on to say : \"You\r\nhave all heard, O Athenians, how philanthropic is the spirit of that law, which\r\nprotects even the slave.\" From Demosthenes we also learn that slaves\r\nwere protected by and subject to the Athenian laws governing commerce . They\r\nhad the right to be captains of [merchant] ships, to represent their masters as\r\nagents in the  foreign ports they visited, and to appear as litigants in the\r\ncourts of law in which cases having to do with commerce were heard . As\r\nfar as income is concerned, we have some pretty startling examples of just how\r\nadept some were at accumulating wealth, such as in the case of Demetrius of\r\nPhlerum's cook, who earned enough money in two years to buy three houses . 5. \r\nSlaves in Lacedaemonia Let\r\nus inquire now as to the condition of the slaves in Sparta, where they were\r\ncalled helots [ iltes ] . There, as opposed to the rest of\r\nGreece, the helots were strongly tied to the land . This situation is\r\nexplained by the fact that in Sparta power\r\nwas entirely vested in the government, and not in the people [ dmos ] as\r\nit was elsewhere in Greece . Spartan\r\ncitizens were outnumbered ten to one by the helots, who were in essence the\r\nproperty of the State . The citizens had the services of the helots who\r\nwere assigned to\r\nthem by the State and who farmed the land as sharecroppers,\r\nbut they had no right to either free them, or to increase or decrease the yearly\r\nportion that the helots were obliged to give to them . The size of this portion was\r\ndetermined by the Spartan State, and was usually about 70 bushels [ mdimni ]\r\nof barley for every Spartan (this increased when he married) . 70 bushels came\r\nto approximately 60 hundred-liters in weight, with an equivalent amount of wine,\r\nand 30 hundred-liters of olive oil additionally assessed . This state-imposed ordinance had a\r\nstabilizing effect upon Sparta, since it allowed its citizen-soldiers to\r\nconcentrate on their most important duty, which was the defense of their country . In order to properly fulfill this duty they were expected to\r\nturn away from all other cares, demands, and pleasures of life. At\r\nthis point, it is important to emphasize that these levies had been enacted by\r\nthe State during a year when the harvests were particularly small . The\r\nresult, of course, was that when the yields were above average or even just\r\naverage, the excess did not go to the Spartan master, who could expect only that\r\nportion of the harvest due him by law, but to the helot and his family . This\r\nsituation could sometimes put the helot into the category of an independent\r\nfarmer, and not just a subsistence sharecropper . To this we must add\r\nthat when booty was acquired on campaigns in which the helots took part, any\r\nplunder taken by a helot was his to\r\nkeep, which meant that it was also his to sell . In this way, and\r\nunder this system -- where the yearly income of the citizens was fixed and\r\nunchanging -- there was created in Lacona a society where the masters grew\r\nsteadily poorer, while the helots, year by year, increased their wealth . As further proof of this, we offer the following : When Cleomnes,\r\nthe king of Sparta, needed to raise money for the State, his proposal that this be done\r\nby giving the helots the right to purchase their freedom was adopted by the\r\nEphors [Magistrates] . 6000 helots took advantage of this opportunity and\r\nthe sum which accrued to the benefit of the Spartan treasury amounted to a total\r\nof 500 talents . In other words, 6000 helots were in a\r\nfinancial position to pay over the sum of 5 silver mins [ mna ] apiece for\r\ntheir freedom : a very respectable sum in those days, and indicative of\r\ntheir financial independence (5) . It\r\nmust also not escape our attention that all of the contemporary criticism\r\nregarding the conditions under which the helots lived never seem to compare\r\nthese conditions with the ones under which the Spartan citizen himself had to\r\nlive . To demonstrate, in other words, how the citizen was treated by the\r\nState in comparison to how the helot was treated . If one were to compare\r\nthese two entities within the framework of  Spartan society, one would soon\r\ncome to realize that whether it be in the military, the economic, or the\r\npolitical realm of Spartan life, the laws under which the citizen-soldier lived\r\nwere harsher by far than those governing the helot . This because, as\r\npreviously mentioned, the helot was considered to be the property of the State,\r\nand no Spartan citizen had the right to harm or destroy him, just as no\r\nSpartan citizen had the right to harm or destroy any other State property . Only\r\nthe Spartan military government could determine a helot's punishment, and never\r\na private citizen. We\r\nwill now enquire into the \"krypteia,\" because the truth needs to be\r\ntold about this much-misunderstood institution of Spartan life as well . We\r\nsee the word krypteia, and learn about what it means for the first time, from\r\nthe great Lacedaemonian lawgiver, Lycurgus . It was designed to teach\r\nyoung Spartans how to steal food so as to be able to survive under harsh wartime\r\nconditions (6) . It was, therefore, part of their\r\ntraining which, in addition to their barely adequate \"Spartan\" diet (7) ,\r\ninspired them to devise impromptu food-gathering survival skills that would be of life-saving value to them in the years to come . In spite of this,\r\nhowever, should the Spartan youth be discovered and caught, he was whipped and\r\nput on reduced rations . It was Plato who made this law, given to the\r\nSpartans by Lycurgus, well known among the Greeks . And, much later, it\r\nwould be Aristotle who made the law of krypteia synonymous with the training of\r\nyoung Spartans to stealthily murder those helots thought to be a threat against\r\nthe Spartan State . In truth, the helots were anything but a threat to\r\nSparta. Let\r\nus see now just who these helots actually were . The [Greek] geographer,\r\nStrabo, tells us (G.35) that the first capitulation of the Laconians to the\r\nDorians came about as a result of a treaty which granted the former equality and\r\na measure of civil rights . However, at around 1000 B.C., under the rule\r\nof Agis, the son of Euresthnes, this treaty was violated . The result\r\nwas an uprising by the inhabitants of the territory of Helos, after which, when\r\nthe Spartans had put down the revolt, the name helots gained currency and came\r\nto mean those descendants of the original inhabitants of the country . From\r\nthat time forward, the helots became part of the almost totally peaceful and\r\nharmonious population, all of whom came to be known as Lacedaemonians . The\r\nhelots served in the army and the navy . In the navy, they served as\r\nrowers, and in the army as adjutants, porters, and even armed troops [hoplites] . Should a helot distinguish himself in battle, he would be given his freedom\r\nand be graduated to higher category ; that of a neodamdon [newly-enfranchised\r\ncitizen] as a reward for his bravery . Another category was that of mthones ,\r\nwho were the children of a helot mother and a Spartan father . These\r\nchildren were brought up as foster brothers and sisters of the Spartans, and\r\nboth sexes received the same training and upbringing as any other Spartan child . They could, in time, attain full Spartan citizenship, which brought with it\r\nall the rights, privileges, and obligations of a full-fledged Spartan. Which\r\nbrings us to ask the following : How is it that these so-called\r\n\"enemies\" of Sparta were able to receive Spartan military training,\r\nand even allowed to bear arms during wartime? And why, since the helots so\r\noutnumbered their \"masters,\" the ratio in war being in excess of 7 to\r\n1, weren't the Spartans afraid that the helots would turn on them or desert to\r\nthe enemy?  In spite of many opportunities to do so, there is not one\r\ninstance of desertion by helots during a battle to be found in the ancient\r\nsources . On the contrary, at the battle of Thermopylae, the helots chose\r\nto die to the last man instead of deserting to the Persians, as the Thebans did . Going\r\nback to the Spartans and the helots, we will refer now to a third class of\r\ninhabitants of Lacedaemonia ; the periokoi [literally,\r\n\"dwellers around\"] . These \"neighboring peoples\" (8) had won the right to claim the lion's share during the first land\r\ndistribution lottery instituted by Lycurgus . From the 39,000 klrous [lottery\r\ntickets] distributed, the periokoi received 30,000 and the Spartans\r\nonly 9000 . Another fact which exposes the lie about how unfair the\r\nSpartans were, and how they oppressed the rights of all who were not pure-born\r\ncitizens of Sparta . Equality in the joys and pleasures of life was the\r\nrule, but no equality existed when it came to the duties and obligations of a\r\nSpartan : Such things fell to him alone within the purview of the Spartan way of\r\nlife, and its harsh ethic of military greatness . Closing\r\nnow with our references to Sparta, we remember the words of Archidmus, one of\r\nSparta's great kings, as recorded by the historian Thucydides : \"There\r\nare no differences between one man and another, only the superiority that one\r\nachieves who has been trained in the hardest school.\" 6. \r\nSlavery in Thessaly, Crete, and other parts of Greece There\r\nwere slaves in other parts of Greece besides Athens and Sparta . In Thessaly, they\r\nwere called penstai and thettaloiktai; in Sicyon, korinophroi; in Argos, gymntai; in Crete, klartai, mnotai, afamitai,\r\nthloi, and okeis, and in Locris, oikitai. Corinth's\r\ntyrant Perinder, the son of Cypslus, banned the purchase of new slaves in a\r\nmeasure designed to help the thtes (9) ,\r\nmost of whom were unemployed and starving . Aristotle tells us he did this\r\nbecause he wanted \"even the mediocre to prosper,\" so as not to think\r\nabout wanting to have a say in running [or overturning?] the government . In\r\nThessaly, the penstai were landowners and homeowners . They could have a family, worked wherever they\r\nwished, and were free to carry weapons . Under such conditions, it should\r\ncome as no surprise that some acquired more wealth than their masters. In\r\nCrete, conditions were even more liberal . From the great \"Gortyn\r\nInscription,\" discovered in 1884 near the modern-day village of Aghoi Dka\r\nin the South Central part of the island, we learn much relating to how the\r\ninstitution of slavery was viewed in ancient Crete . Noteworthy is the\r\nfact that fully 1/3 of the text -- referred to as the \"Code of Gortyn,\"\r\n-- has to do with slavery . Slaves had the right to acquire property ; meaning,\r\nof course, that they could accumulate and possess wealth . They were\r\nrequired to pay fines ; which meant that they had the right to possess not\r\nonly real estate, but personal property as well . From the historian\r\nEphorus (10) , we learn that the klartes were\r\npersonal slaves who were intimately involved in the lives of their masters . In\r\nKydona, there were special festivals and holidays set aside exclusively for\r\nthe slaves . During the celebration of these festivals, the slaves had the right to\r\n\"beat\" freeborn Cretans. ... Callistratus [4th century B.C. orator] tells us that the\r\nCretans, in order to avoid saying the word \"servant\" (which had a slightly\r\nnegative connotation, just as it does today), would refer to their domestics as mnotai, thereby hinting that they were the descendants of King Mnos himself (11) . There\r\nis much more that could be said about the rights, duties, and conditions of life\r\nof the slaves in the ancient Greek world . Surely, this study does not\r\ncome anywhere near exhausting the subject, and simply \"scratches the\r\nsurface,\" so to speak . There are, of course, omissions and\r\ndifferences of opinions concerning this topic which have not been addressed . The\r\nattempt was to present this important\r\nsubject in an objective and serious manner, and to do so within the framework\r\nof the socio-political and economic conditions which were prevalent at the time,\r\nthereby avoiding the distortions and politically correct interpretations\r\ninspired by present-day attitudes and fashions . To examine the facts, and to avoid\r\nfalling into the pitfall of catering to the current \"-isms\" which are\r\ndirected more by self-interest than by a scholarly search for the truth . To\r\ndemonstrate that the role of the slave was different than that of the free\r\ncitizen, but not necessarily inferior, without degrading or romanticizing either\r\none . To show, in other words, as much as is possible in a quick study,\r\njust what the words \"slave,\" and \"slavery\" meant to the\r\nancient Greeks. The\r\nHellenic race deserves and demands to know the truth regarding its history,\r\nbecause it has been subjected to historical distortions and outright lies long\r\nenough. Notes\r\nto part II 1. \r\nThe word \"slave\" in Greek is \" tholos . \"\r\nLiterally translated it means \"worker,\" or one required to\r\nperform \"work\" ( thoulia ) for another. ed. 2. \r\nA himation was a mantle, usually made of course wool, worn by both sexes as\r\nstreet dress. ed. 3. \r\nA chiton was a woolen undergarment or tunic. ed. 4. \r\nThese mines were located in the hilly district near the city of Larium (today\r\nLvrion), in South Attica near Cape Sonion . They were the property of the State, and were leased out to private citizens for\r\nexploitation. ed. 5. \r\n60 min = one talent. ed. 6. \r\nThe American armed forces, as part of the basic training exercises given in\r\n\"boot camp\" to raw recruits, teach the trainees how to survive by stealing food from the\r\nlocals should they ever find themselves in enemy territory . These skills are taught\r\nas part of a series of \"Field Expediency\" courses taught to all troops . We wonder why American professors in the Liberal Arts, and other\r\nmulticulturalist proponents of \"diversity\" and \"human\r\nrights,\" don't make as much of\r\na fuss about this as they make about the \"krypteia\" of Sparta? As\r\nfar as Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Hillary Clinton and company are concerned, we\r\nthink we know why they don't make a fuss about it : Most likely it is\r\nbecause the modern version of this exercise provides their future acolytes with\r\nexcellent subsistence skills after they enter civilian life. ed. 7. \r\nA good part of this diet consisted of a notorious black broth so unpalatable that, as the story goes, when a visitor to Sparta first tasted it, he\r\nexclaimed : \"Now I know why you Spartans are so willing to die for\r\nyour country.\" ed. 8. Periokoi frequently constituted local, self-governing groups of\r\n\"neighboring peoples\" who were subjects or quasi-citizens, and who inhabited various Greek States without\r\nhaving rights in the administration of government . They were to be found\r\nin Elis, Thessaly, Crete, and other parts of Greece . Those of Sparta --\r\nwhere they appeared as Spartans with lesser rights -- are the best known.\r\ned. 9. Thtes were laborers who hired themselves out for a day's wages, and were the lowest\r\nclass of free men in Greece . Lacking the required number of mdimni in\r\nwealth, they could not serve in the magistracies of Athens, and because they\r\ncould not afford a suit of armor, they were not able to serve in the hoplite\r\nranks . After Athens became predominately a sea power, thtes were able to\r\nfind steady employment as rowers in the fleet; a situation that greatly\r\nstrengthened the institution of participatory democracy in that city. ed. 10.\r\nEphorus of Cme (circa 405 - 330 B.C.) was a pupil of the great rhetorician,\r\nIsocrates . He is considered by some to be (after Xenophon) the most\r\nimportant historian of the 4th century. ed. 11.\r\nMnos is the name of a great king of Crete after whom the Minoan Civilization\r\nwas named .
