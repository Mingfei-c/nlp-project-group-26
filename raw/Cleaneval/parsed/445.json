Here's a favorite one of mine: Back when Ilived in New York there was this fabulous, crazy-ass juice bar on West Houston called Lucky's Juice Joint. Ithink it's no longer there. Ihear it's moved. It was the most out-of-place business south of 14th Street. Hard to descibe, except as a \"hardcore hippie haven\". Just had this weird, crazy, psychedelic-rainforest vibe. But damn, it had the best juice in town. It was amazing stuff. Tasted like the fruits and vegetables were picked that morning. Fresher than anything else Ifound in New York. And yes, Ihad searched high and low for even better alternatives, but never found one. In New York, this was really it. The boss was this crazy looking tie-dye wearing guy who looked and talked like he had done too many drugs back in the 'sixties. Abig ol' middle aged, acid-head teddy bear. One day we struck up a brief conversation. Icomplimented the hell out of his product. \"Wow,\" Iquietly gushed, \"Your stuff is the best. It really is...\" \"Sure it is,\" said the guy. \"That's because we make it with reverence.\" You don't have to get a job with a famous company or hot-shot industry in order to have a spectacular career. You just have to do what you do with reverence. [UPDATE:] Tom from True Talk Blog makes a TERRIFIC point: \"Authenticity and reverence are two sides of the same coin.\" Yes! Exactly!"

You know, the one with the fancy-schmancy lifestyle your long-sufferring wife spends all her time enviously reading about in the tabloids? Where does the celeb gets the means to buy all that cool stuff? That's right. From your paycheck. Her money comes from you. Because the money that pays for her TV appearances comes from advertisers, who get their money from you when you go to Wal-Mart and buy their products that you saw advertised on your celeb pal's TV show the night before. Nice to see all that hard-earned money you take home from the job at the paper mill going to help such worthy causes, like a new beach house in Malibu etc. Big Media Celebrity Worship is corporate feudalism at its finest. The little people paying for the big people. Ithink it's cute."

You could say Apple and Harley Davidson were two classic examples. OK, so... A Mark Love is basically a term for a product that was made with a disproportionately high amount of love and respect for the end user. Unlike the Love Mark, it's not about what the consumer thinks of the product. It's about what you think of the consumer, and how your product acts as a conduit to express that. It's 180 degrees from the Love Mark.The energy travels from the product (i.e. you) to the end user, not the other way around. It's about Values. Purpose. Belief. Integrity. Compassion. All that good stuff. You'll notice a lot of Love Marks started life out as Mark Loves first. Ergo: ( Step 1) Create the Mark Love and (Step 2) the Love Mark will soon follow. You want the lady in the shopping mall to love your product? Easy. Love her first. The trouble arises when companies want to get to Step 2 before they've gotten to Step 1. It's so frickin' obvious."

IBM, Digital etc all followed this model. But 25 or so years ago Microsoft asked themselves one of the best questions ever in the history of business: If hardware was free, how would Microsoft make a living? They had seen the writing on the wall. They saw hardware (i.e. the white boxes and circuit boards that make up PCs) eventually becoming a commodity. They looked into the future, and saw the price do nothing but go down. And this was years before hardware became commodified. They decided software was where the action was; theyd let companies like Dell or Toshiba worry about the ever-commodifying molecules. They would just focus exclusively on the bit that would retain its value over time i.e. the software. Apple didnt spot this. Apple held on to hardware. Apple nearly went under. Microsoft became one of the biggest companies in the world. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. So heres my question to my fellow advertising folk, in the same vein: If they made advertising illegal overnight, how would your company make a living? Seriously. Any fool company can come up with a decent campaign brief. Any fool company can produce an award-winning TV commercial. Thats no longer where the value is. Like computer hardware, that part of the business has become commodified. The real long-term, non-commodified value is elsewhere. So wheres the non-commodified part? Seriously. Ihave an idea. It's very exciting."

So they rattle off a list: Reebok, Bluetooth, Mercedes, Apple, Captain Bennys Seafood Restaurant, Typepad, whatever Usually, they list around a dozen. Then they lose interest and the coversation tails off. The average person with a decent job (i.e. with money to spend on your product) interacts with around 40 thousand brands, and even thats a conservative estimate. 12 out of 40,000. So even if the person buys your product, you brand has about a 0.0003% chance of being a Love Mark with them. Anyone who enters a market thinking to beat those odds is a fool. Advice to marketeers: Stop worrying about whether people you dont know love your brand or not. Stop worrying about if your brand conforms to some vague ideal in a business/marketing book written by a clever guy youve never met. Worry instead about how much you and the people you know, love and respect love it. Imean REALLY love it. Be brutally honest. If you and yours dont love it, nobody else will. If you and yours do love it, others will. Love is viral, indifference isnt. Its that simple."

Idraw some of them on other people's printed cards, but mostly Idraw on blank pieces of high quality bristol board, cut to business card size. This goes back to the early days when instead of handing out my company's business cards, Iwould just make a wee doodle on a blank card with my contact details on the back. People remebered it more, somehow. So blank cards have always been \"business cards\" to me. Depends how you want to define it. 4. Are you a full time cartoonist? No. It's just a hobby. 5. Are you married? No. Very single at the moment. Never been married. No kids to my knowledge, either. 6. What's your day job? I'm a \"blogvertising\" consultant . 7. I'm new to gapingvoid. What should Icheck out first? This is what Igenerally point people to: The About Page: History of the cartoon-bizcard format, plus a list of my dozen or so sentimental favorite cartoons, with the story of how each one came into being. The Hughtrain: \"The market for something to believe in is infinite.\" Arant about the new realities of marketing. How To Be Creative: Tips that have worked for me over the years. The book proposal is here. The Sex & Cash Theory: \"The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended.\" Old Site: Before Igot into this whole blogging thing, Iposted about 400 drawings on an old-fashioned website. Worth checking out. 7. What do you look like? Some wonderfully unflattering pics of me are here."

Iabsolutely despise the market most cartoonists have to schlep in. Being a conventional advertising copywriter is also not it. Most copywriters are uninspired hacks with only a small bag of smartass tricks separating themselves and oblivion. Very few of them bring any seriously original thinking to their clients problems. And very few clients ask copywriters for serious thinking as a result. They ask other people instead. My dream job would be to somehow combine the two. My dream job would be to license my drawing style to a company. Iwould draw them cartoons related to their business. On a deeper level Iwould apply The Hughtrain to their branding and their business. My contribution would be to give them a very unique voice with which to express their brand essence, which would also be informed by my rather ahead-of-the-curve brand and marketing theories. It would have to be the right company, though. Acompany with a great product, great people, a great corporate culture, and deep enough pockets to pay my salary. If you know anybody, please forward this page to them. Thanks. Joi Ito and others tell me the tech market is coming back. I'm thinking if Imove again, it'll be to San Francisco, where people who have the same crazy kind of ideas as me seem to congregate. Watch this space. Email: hugh at gapingvoid etc."

Here is the rough outline for the publishing folk etc. (NB: The Book Proposal is here) \"The Sex & Cash Theory: How To Be Creative In A Non-Creative World\" \"Sex & Cash\" is a book about how to deal with the creative bug properly without it ruining your life. The book will have about 15-30 thousand words. It will be small and thick; I'm thinking 5 x 8 inches. Mixed in with the main text will be hundreds of my cartoons, which will compliment the writing. The Pitch: \"Seth Godin meets Edward Gorey\". You either get it or you don't. Introduction: \"The best way to get approval is not to need it.\" This is the central message of the book. Alot of people daydream about living the creative life, about being a writer, artist, whatever, even if they don't really have anything to say or really want to do the actual work. This book is not for them. This book is for people who already have a few ideas of their own, who may already be well on their way, but maybe could use a wee push. It's not an instruction manual. It just shows where some of the land mines are buried, and gives direct and unapologetic advice on how to avoid stepping on them. It will be very different from the usual touchy-feely \"Personal Creativity\" fare. It'll have a bit more bite to it. It will not try to romantisize the creative life, nor try to convert people to living it. The aim is not to make the reader feel comforted, validated or make it all seem easier than it actually is. The main thesis of the book is just to get on with it; that only when one has dropped all those clichd romantic daydreams about being creative, does the world actually start paying attention, do things actually start moving forward. The book introduction will have similar to the preceding two paragraphs. The book has four main sections: Section 1.  The Sex & Cash Theory: 500 words. \"The creative person basically has two kinds of jobs: One is the sexy, creative kind. Second is the kind that pays the bills. Sometimes the task in hand covers both bases, but not often. This tense duality will always play center stage. It will never be transcended.\" (full text here...) Section 2. Cartoons drawn on the back of business cards. 3,000 words. An introduction to my work, and the story behind how the cartoon format came into being. It'll also show a few of my sentimental favorite cartoons, and the stories of how they came into being."

Or in my case, upstreaming from showing free cartoons on the net, to selling my advertising services to one of my readers who has a business needing sold to a large audience. The whole frickin advertising businesses is currently going through a turbulent upstreaming phase at the moment. Alot of the things ad agencies are used to selling to their clients are not nearly as rare or valuable as they once were. And the people in the cubes doing the work are finding themselves less and less valued. An art director Iknow was laid off from Ogilvy's in New York about 2 years ago. Hes had a very hard time. His current situation is a total disaster. Hes 40 years old. Before the layoff his career had been less than spectacular.

Foot soldiers. They were ordered to advance, fight to the death, and never retreat. Manoeuvring a phalanx of them in any direction other than forwards was pretty much impossible until the advent of the highly trained, highly drilled professional soldier, which didn't appear until much later with the Romans. 2. Knights. In ancient times, Calvary never advanced head on, but flanked i.e. they went around the back and attacked at the side. 3. Rooks. The original chess rooks were not castles, but war elephants. Elephants are fairly unstoppable once they get going, but not very manoeuvrable. Hence they can go in straight lines- forward, backward, left, right- but little else. In ancient times war elephants carried little castles on their backs, from which archers would fire down (think Lord of the Rings). Europe has no elephants, but does have castles. So the latter caught on. 4. Bishops. Chess predates Christianity in Europe. The original bishop pieces were actually sailing ships. Sailing ships never go straight, but tack to the left or right i.e. diagonal. The sail of the ship resembles the bishops crown. The bishops's crown was stylistically adopted in Europe during the Dark Ages, as Chistianity spread and naval warfare went into decline after the fall of the Roman Empire. 5. The Queen. The Queens entourage was always looked after by a small, elite, highly trained bodyguard. The imperative to protect the women and children was very strong. If trouble was afoot it needed to get the hell out of Dodge very quickly. Ergo the bodyguard was very mobile and very deadly. It needed to be. 6. The King, though powerful and free to choose any direction he wanted, was heavily laden with the apparatus of state. The King could not just drop everything and flee; he had the court, the treasury and the ministers weighing him down. So his movements were fairly limited."

Imagine the power youd have if you could pull it off. But sadly, it doesnt work that way. You cant love a crowd the same way you can love a person. And a crowd cant love you the way a single person can love you. Intimacy doesnt scale. Not really. Intimacy is a one-on-one phenomenon. It's not a big deal. Whether youre writing to an audience of one, five, a thousand,  a million, ten million, theres really only one way to really connect. One way that actually works: Write from the heart. There is no silver bullet. There is only the love God gave you."

This is amusing because the actual product is all about making their corporate clients more transparent. Suddenly plain speaking went out the window. This is amusing because the actual product is all about making their corporate clients more plain speaking. Suddenly the workers no longer feel theyre part of something, except perhaps making their bosses rich. The early adapters who first used the product with relish and spread the word during the company's infancy are no longer appreciated, nor is their feedback actively sought any more. They were useful once, but now they have served their purpose. They're now told to go back and get in line with the rest of the plebes. They are no longer customers, they are consumers. We both already know how this story is going to end. Part of my current job is helping prevent companies from falling into this trap.

The week of the paper being signed, the entire agency was crowded into this big room, and the then CEO of Euro RSCG, Bob Schmetterer, our new boss, gave us this big pep talk. We were part of this big global future that was happening or whatever. Fair enough. Ikinda saw the vision. It made sense, sorta, at least from a senior management position. We grunts were less sure, but since when are grunts sure about anything senior management gets up to? So Bob opened the floor to questions. Nobody really had any, which Ithought was odd. So to break the awkward silence Iraised my hand. In time of great change, Iasked, some things get harder, some things get easier, and the harder bit is usually where the money is. What's the hardest part of your job now? Getting people on board, said Bob. Not everybody gets it. In times of great change, some things get harder, some things get easier. Concentrate on the former, because thats where the money is. Istill use that thought with my clients today. Iguess what interests me about any business is the hard parts. The easy parts are always overcrowded, underpaid and quietly dying."

It doesn't matter if they're a 20-year-old art student or a 50-year-old Oscar Nominee. Their palpable unease carries the same vibe.

TROGGING: Trust + Blogging i.e. \"Using Blogs to build trust and transparency.\" It occurs to me that my opinion of Microsoft has risen considerably in the last year. Not that Iever belonged to the \"Bill Gates is Satan\" crowd. Inever was into computers enough to really care whether a guy in Redmond wrote the code, or some guy in Toledo. The same way Idon't really care who made my telphone or my microwave, so long as it works. It's not an area where Iproject a lot of myself in to. Still, there is something quite monolithic about Microsoft, and one always keeps an eyebrow raised when something gets that big, quite rightly. So what happened? Anew product? Nope. Istill use the same Windows 98 and creaky, old Dell as always. Great new advertising campaign? Nope. Not watching much TV these days. Bill Gates gave all his money to cancer research? Nope. Not seen that much mention of him in the media recently. What happened in there's this guy called Robert Scoble who has a blog that I've been reading a lot this last 6-9 months. Robert works for Microsoft. Mark seems like a smart, honest, regular guy who holds down a job, same as the rest of us. He just happens to work for Microsoft. Robert writes about his job and his company the same way Iwould if Iworked for them and liked my job. Informal, informed, friendly, it gives real insight about his company where possible- he tries to be as open and insightful as he can without disclosing trade secrets. It other words, he seems sane, reasonable, trustworthy, human and somebody who knows what he's talking about. Which to me helps make Microsoft seem likewise. One guy and his blog, doing more real good for his company than any multimillion dollar ad agency campaign could ever hope to achieve. As somebody in the ad business, Ifind the implications staggering. Long live Robert Scoble, King of the Troggers!

As a customer (Ihave four of their locks), Iwould really like to know whether this problem affect their other products, or whether it is limited to that Evolution 2000.

      "text": "Blogged Previously: Taking on board what I've learned from blogging Young Adam , this is how I'd design a commercial blog for a big-budget movie. 1. Iwould keep the blog entries as short and sweet as possible. Movie goers have short attention spans. 2. Iwould post links to do with all the people invloved. If John Travolta was the star Iwould blog all the interesting stuff on him Icould find. His love of flying airplanes or whatever. The blog would become as much an A-Grade source for Travolta information as it would for the film. Iwould do likewise for all the other actors, and the director, and even the producer. The point of publicity is to make the recipient feel like he/she is getting real, juicy, insider info. Afeeling not unlike the college student gets when the bouncer finally lets him in to the club. \"Make them feel like they're getting behind the velvet rope\" etc. 3. Iwould keep on hammering away on why Ithink it's a good movie. Iwould never let them forget Ithink it's a good movie. Ever. 4. If the movie was getting any \"buzz\", I'd report on that too. 5. Iwould make sure the blog had an authentic voice. Of course, if it's a great movie my job is easier. If the movie is a total dud, Iwould dig deeper in order to find whatever merit Icould. The way to do that, obviously, is not to compare it with Citizen Kane. Better to realize that even a mediocre movie has a good story behind it- the combined results of millions of dollars and roomfulls of smart, driven people. Try to find the brightest people on the project and try to bring their energy in to the equation. Even if it's the worst movie ever, there might be some amazingly wonderful person working in the costume department or whatever. Try to tap into that side of things. 6. Talk about the actual business. Perhaps explain to people the compelxities of a distribution deal or whatever. Try to make them see where the movie fits within a billion dollar industry. Cultivate intrigue. Again, people want to be 'insiders', it's hard-wired into our systems to want to belong to the Alpha Group. Get them beind the velvet rope, any way you can. 7. Start early. To build awareness of the movie properly needs at least least a year, preferably two. It's not about telling millions of people at once. You talk to a few thousand at a time. Let the word spread gradually. Give it time to seep into the Zeitgeist, like absinthe on a sugar cube. 8. Buy media. Word-of-mouth is good, but not always reliable. Buy the means to drive the necessary eyeballs to your site, and charge it to your client at an honest profit to yourself. 9. Allow comments. Let your readers contribute, the more the better- it builds interactivity, word-of-mouth, and most importantly, credibiltiy. That being said, have no qualms about deleteing rude ones and banning ISP addresses. \"Trolls\" are never helpful. Be prepared to police your blog vigilantly. 10. All this is in vain without some kernel of intellectual honesty informing your every action."

As the simple playlist replaces the album's remaining value of simplifying choice, CDs commence a slow glide to oblivion, moderated only by the installed base of equipment and consumer habit."

      "text": "Jeff Jarvis has some nice thoughts to add: If the network or the newspaper or the magazine or the cable system was the old bundle, the internet itself is the new bundle: In this medium of extreme control, we each put together whatever bundle we want... This accelerates the commoditization of content. It also provides opportunities for those who can add value (and convenience and perspective and even fun)... In this new distributed, unbundled, post-marketplace, molecular, commoditized media world, value can be added in many ways. It's about relationships. It's about relevancy. It's about service. It's about uniqueness. It's about perspective. My two cents: Afriend of mine just got laid off from his high-paying editorial job at FHM. He's 37. His bosses figured they could get a 26 year old to do the job a lot cheaper. They were right, of course. Every non-executive media, publishing and advertising person Iknow is hurting. But Idon't expect the pain levels to ever decrease, for reasons Tim and Jeff talked about. Even worse, a lot of these folk live in \"media center\" cities like New York or London that, unlike the prices they command for their services, never get cheaper. i.e. their jobs are worth less and less every day, the towns they live in get more and more expensive to live in every day. It's unsustainable. We media/advertising/content folk are supposed to be \"creative\". Yet we're very uncreative when it comes to thinking about our business models differently. We still expect management to take care of that aspect for us, in exchange for allowing our \"creativity\" to be squeezed like lemons. Management knows we're screwed, knows we're stuck, knows we're desperate, so they squeeze harder. Iwould do the same. So would you. Like Isaid in \"How To Be Creative\", all existing business models are wrong. Find a new one."

My two cents: It's not just consumers have too much choice; it's that they've gotten too smart. They know that $100 t-shirt cost $2 to make in The Phillipines. They know the supermodel is just as screwy, tedious and flawed as the rest of us. They know there's  a short, bald guy behind the curtain. Dazzling them with your brand isn't as easy as it used to be. The bullshit detectors are a lot more powerful than when you were back getting your MBA. And they're getting more powerful every day. You know that, Iknow that, to pretend otherwise is just stupid and wrong. You no longer control the conversation, they do. All you can do is make products that enhance the conversation. That make the conversation interesting and wonderful. It's what Isaid in The Hughtrain: \"It's not just the product. People have to love the process as well.\" i.e. It's not what you do, it's the way that you do it. Markets are now faster and smarter than you are. Without belief and purpose, you have nothing."

In mass-market advertising, both space and airtime are very expensive. So every sentence you cut out saves thousands of dollars of your client's money. In a world of permanently fragmenting media, the market for \"shorter\" increases. The market for \"longer\" decreases. Artistically one could easily find that objectionable, but that doesn't change the actual market."

Or Robert Ryman discovering all-white canvases. Andy Warhol discovering silkscreen. Hunter S Thompsonn discovering Gonzo Journalism. Duchamp discovering the Found Object. Jasper Johns discovering the American Flag. Hemingway discovering brevity. James Joyce discovering stream-of-conciousness prose. Was it luck? Perhaps a little bit. But it wasn't the format that made the art great. It was the fact that somehow while playing around with something new, suddenly they found themselves able to put their entire selves into it. Only then did it become their 'schtick', their true voice etc. That's what people responded to. The humanity, not the form. The voice, not the form. Put your whole self into it, and you will find your true voice. Hold back and you won't. It's that simple."

Iwanted an art form that was perfect for that. So if Iwas walking down the street and Isuddenly got hit with the itch to draw something, Icould just nip over to the nearest park bench or coffee shop, pull out a blank card from my bag and get busy doing my thing. Seamless. Effortless. No fuss. Ilike it. Before, when Iwas doing larger works, every time Igot an idea while walking down the street Id have to quit what Iwas doing and schlep back to my studio while the inspiration was still buzzing around in my head. Nine times out of ten the inspired moment would have past by the time Igot back, rendering the whole exercise futile. Sure, Id get drawing anyway, but it always seemed Iwas drawing a memory, not something happening at that very moment. If youre arranging your life in such a way that you need to make a lot of fuss between feeling the itch and getting to work, youre putting the cart before the horse. Youre probably creating a lot of counterproductive Me, The Artist, Imust create, Imust leave something to posterity melodrama. Not interesting for you or for anyone else. You have to find a way of working that makes it dead easy to take full advantage of your inspired moments. They never hit at a convenient time, nor do they last long. Conversely, neither should you fret too much about writers block, artists block or whatever. If youre looking at a blank piece of paper and nothing comes to you, then go do something else. Writers block is just a symptom of feeling like you have nothing to say, combined with the rather weird idea that you SHOULD feel the need to say something. Why? If you have something to say, then say it. If not, enjoy the silence while it lasts. The noise will return soon enough. Ithe meantime, youre better off going out into the big, wide world, having some adventures and refilling your well. Trying to create when you dont feel like it is like making conversation for the sake of making conversation. Its not really connecting, its just droning on like an old, drunken barfly."

No, Idon't think we're all suddenly taking magic mushrooms, or Jesus has come back for a second round etc. There are many reasons, a lot of them simply to do with technology bringing people closer together etc. But there may be another good reason; one Ithought of last night while Iwas re-reading Tom Peter's wonderful new book, \"Re-Imagine!\": The Baby Boomers, the most powerful demographic in the history of the world, are starting to age. The older ones are hitting their sixties. The younger ones are hitting their forties. You get older, and suddenly life isn't so much about sex and ambition anymore. Suddenly you find there are fewer days ahead of you than there are behind you. Suddenly you get reflective. Suddenly you start looking \"inside\". And, because you're part of the most powerful demographic in the world, everybody and everything else starts doing the same. I'll say it again. We live in wonderfully interesting times."
