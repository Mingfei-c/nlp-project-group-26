One such dubious ally, the nice-sounding Freedom\r\n  Forum , has won the support of many Christian leaders by joining their quest for\r\n  \"religious freedom\" in public schools. Few seem to realize that the cost of this\r\n  questionable partnership is the purity of God's Word. Remember, the Bible's message ceases\r\n  to be God's uncompromising Truth when slashed by inter-faith criticism, judged by group consensus, and\r\n  molded to fit politically correct standards. Yet,\r\n  Christians across the country praise this revival. With their approval, a compromised\r\n  view of the Bible blends with other sacred writings and religious messages in the classroom. By a\r\n  strange consensus, these religions are being\r\n  adapted to fit a new\r\n  interpretation of the First Amendment -- one that twists its promised freedom into pretext and\r\n  control. Thus, schoolchildren learn \"about the Bible\" through a pre-planned group\r\n  process which twists God's truths into the evolving ideals of the planned global spirituality.\r\n  (See Mind Control )"

      "text": "Finding Common Ground outlines the social contract for the\r\n  global village. It also illustrates\r\n  how its group of authors did \"redefine the words\" and introduce a new social\r\n  contract. Quoting from the Williamsburg Charter, which laid the foundation for The First Liberty\r\n  Institute headed by Dr. Haynes, it states, \"The Compact Must be Mutual.  \r\n    ...that rights are universal and\r\n    responsibilities mutual is both the premise and the promise of democratic\r\n    pluralism.. From this axiom derives guidelines for conducting public debates\r\n    involving religion.\" \"First, those who claim the\r\n    right to dissent should assume the responsibility to debate:\r\n    Commitment to democratic pluralism assumes the coexistence with one political\r\n    community of groups whose ultimate faith commitments may be incompatible, yet whose\r\n    common commitment to social unity and diversity does justice to both the requirements\r\n    of individual conscience and the wider community. A general consent to the obligations\r\n    of citizenship is therefore inherent.\" \"Second, those who claim the\r\n    right to criticize should assume the responsibility to comprehend.\r\n    Genuine tolerance honestly weights honest differences and promotes both impartiality\r\n    and pluralism. Debased tolerance results in indifference to the differences that\r\n    vitalize a pluralistic democracy.\" \"Third, those who claim the\r\n    right to influence should accept the responsibility not to inflame.\" [8] The last statement\r\n    points to a basic, though unstated, ground rule for the consensus process: Don't offend\r\n    the diverse group members with politically incorrect expressions. Unpopular \r\n\tfacts or ideas clash with an essential part of the transformational process: building trusting relationships \r\n\tthat bridge the inter-faith and cross-cultural divisions. Naturally, it doesn't take long\r\n    before the group's\r\n    disapproval intimidates most dissenters into silence. Few Christians dare voice \r\n\tcontrary facts, values or\r\n    beliefs that might violate another person's comfort zone. That's \r\n\tagainst the rules!

On page 11, it states\r\n  that...

Only\r\n  a cross-less, malleable, ever-changing form of Christianity would pass the test. To\r\n  make sure high school students don't escape this mental training,\r\n    Charles Haynes calls for a conclusive course for high school seniors. In his article, \" The\r\n  Relationship of Religion to Moral Education in the Public Schools, \"\r\n  co-authored by Professor Warren Nord (University of NC at Chapel Hill) and posted on the Communitarian Network ),\r\n    he said, \"We also believe, however, that there should be room in the\r\n    curriculum for a capstone course that high school seniors might take, in which\r\n    they learn about the most important frameworks of moral thought, secular and\r\n    religious, historical and contemporary, and how such frameworks might shape our\r\n    thinking about the most urgent moral problems we face. \"...It is striking to us that most economics texts (quite properly)\r\n    include discussions of Marxism and socialism, but none that we have seen says anything\r\n    significant about religious ways of thinking about economics.\" [9] Guide\r\n    change in the \"right\" direction We\r\n          should stop bemoaning the growth of cities.

Some call it a paradigm\r\n  shift. Look at the three main paradigms (ways of thinking and\r\n  understanding reality) of the last fifty years. Notice that secular\r\n  humanism was only a brief transition stage. By the turn of the millennium, our culture\r\n  had generally embraced the global\r\n  paradigm.

      "text": "Professor John\r\n  Goodlad worked on the 1987 Study Commission on\r\n  Global Education with Bill Clinton and Ernest Boyer, former president of CFAT (Carnegie Foundation for the\r\n  Advancement of Teaching).  Boyer, in turn, supported Charles Haynes' agenda for\r\n  using the Bible to spur interest in interfaith dialogue. In his Preface to Schooling for a Global Age , Goodlad wrote: Enlightened\r\n  social engineering is required to face situations that demand global action now.\r\n  Parents and the general public must be reached also, otherwise children and youth\r\n  enrolled in globally oriented programs may find themselves in conflict with values\r\n  assumed in the home. Does this\r\n  sound like manipulation and brainwashing? It should! Successful \"social engineering\"\r\n  must mold the minds of the masses so effectively that no\r\n  rational argument can persuade the people to turn back. In the light of Professor\r\n  Goodlad's vision -- and\r\n  of the paradigm shift shown above -- consider the meaning behind the following\r\n  statements from UNESCOs report, Our\r\n  Creative Diversity : Education must inform but it must also form, it must provide them with a sense of meaning to guide their actions. \r\n  Education should promote rational understanding of conflict, tensions, and the\r\n  processes involved, provoke a critical awareness and provide a basis for the analysis\r\n  of concepts that will prevent chauvinist and\r\n  irrational explanations from being accepted. \"Its\r\n  primary task is to provide information, explain and analyze problems and subject them to\r\n  criticism.  It should cover adults as\r\n  well. The principle of lifelong education should be the aim of all societies. [10] The\r\n  second paragraph shows three important steps in the consensus process: Provide the\r\n  selected pieces of  information needed to persuade the group members, explain the\r\n  problems (or crises) from the global or pluralistic perspective, then subject it to the\r\n  criticism of the group. The members will think their ideas are their own, never\r\n  realizing they were suggested to them by the information and context provided by the\r\n  facilitator. Eventually, these steps to \"Finding Common Ground\" becomes\r\n  a lifestyle. Back in the\r\n  fifties, Edward Hunter wrote the book, Brainwashing,\r\n  an insightful expose documenting Soviet brainwashing strategies in China and other Communist\r\n  countries. A summary of his book can be found in the U.S. Congressional Record. (See Communist\r\n  Psychological Warfare ) Mr. Hunter's warnings\r\n  should shine a red light into our foolish presumptions that this process couldnt be\r\n  used in our free nation. [11] Compare his warning below with the above comment from Our Creative Diversity: Even when he stands by himself,\r\n    the truly indoctrinated communist must be part of the collective. He must be\r\n    incapable of hearing opposing ideas and facts, no matter how convincing or how\r\n    forcibly they bombard his senses.  A\r\n    trustworthy communist must reach in an automatic manner without any force being\r\n    applied. [12] The\r\n  following statement from \" The\r\n  Relationship of Religion to Moral Education in the Public Schools \"\r\n  by Charles\r\n    Haynes and Warren Nord is less explicit but\r\n  brings a similar message: Moralities\r\n    are grounded in worldviews that make sense\r\n    of them, that render them rational, that give them cultural and intellectual\r\n    force.\" [13] In\r\n    other words, the key to change is establishing in the minds of people the new world view -- the collective\r\n    way of thinking, of seeing and of understanding social issues. The main strategy for\r\n    accomplishing this change is the consensus process. Break\r\n  down boundaries and build consensus The\r\n    UN vision for global\r\n    solidarity demands continual measurement of social\r\n    capital in every community. To raise their score on this international assessment of community oneness,\r\n    leaders are seeking ways to involve everyone in the consensus\r\n    process .  Two of the more common labels for this process are \"Conflict\r\n  Resolution\" and \"sensitivity training.\"  While it often helps to resolve genuine\r\n  conflicts (that's the crisis needed to bring people into the process), it's main purpose is\r\n    to change the way people think and relate to each other. The vision\r\n  for this social transformation was articulated back in 1948 in a statement titled,\r\n  \"Mental Health and World Citizenship, prepared for the International\r\n  Congress on Mental Health, which met in London. Notice their strategy for change: Social\r\n  institutions such as family and school impose their imprint early  Thus prejudice,\r\n  hostility or excessive nationalism may become deeply embedded in the developing\r\n  personality often at great human cost.... Change\r\n  will be strongly resisted unless an attitude of acceptance has first been engendered. [14] Now, \r\n\tmore than five decades later, there is little resistance to the planned \r\n\tsocial transformation. In Finding\r\n  Common Ground , Charles\r\n  Haynes, tells us that, Establishing a climate where people listen to one another requires that we go\r\n  beyond labels and rebuild trust.  Putting aside labels and stereotypes and taking\r\n  seriously the position of the other side are the starting points for genuine\r\n  dialogue. Sounds good,\r\n  doesn't it?  People long for a climate of trust and friendliness.  The\r\n  question is: can you trust this process? Designed to manipulate groups toward a pre-planned\r\n  change in values, Mr. Haynes' principles will indeed \"create an attitude of acceptance\" for the\r\n  new way of thinking. But this attitude tends to immunize children against Biblical faith.\r\n  Rather than promoting neutrality, it promotes pluralism and a universalist distortion of\r\n  Christianity. Mr. Haynes\r\n  assures his followers that all beliefs must be respected. That's partly true. \r\n\tBut continual tension and compromise is essential. \"Conflict and debate are vital to\r\n  democracy,\" writes Haynes in Teaching the\r\n  Role of Religion in American History . Haynes'\r\n  assurances only make his program more deceptive. Keep in mind, conflict and dialogue are\r\n  vital to the consensus process. And the trained teacher/ facilitator can't lead the\r\n  dialogue effectively without the tension created by diversity. This tension \r\n\tenergizes members and, when used correctly, produces synergy . You can't train\r\n  people to compromise (or synthesize) without opposing views -- a \"thesis and\r\n  antithesis.\" That helps explain why the consensus process must include\r\n  all these elements: a diverse group dialoguing to consensus over a social issue led by a trained\r\n  facilitator toward a pre-planned\r\n  outcome [15] The true\r\n  dialectic group never reaches a final consensus , for change must \r\n\tan ongoing process: one step today; another tomorrow. Continual change is a global motto. To permanently change the way people think and relate, \r\n\tour leaders must continue to set the stage for conflict and compromise week \r\n\tafter week, year after year. Group thinking and the dialectic process must \r\n\tbecome as normal as eating. Eventually, people learn to discard all their old mental\r\n  anchors and boundaries -- all the facts and faith that maintained their firm convictions. They become like boats\r\n  adrift, always ready to shift with any wind or current that comes their\r\n  way. The Association for\r\n  Supervision and Curriculum (ASCD, the curriculum arm of the NEA) has supported Mr. Haynes\r\n  programs  for many years. In 1970, it published To Nurture Humaneness , which\r\n  offers a glimpse of the envisioned goal: \"...absolute behavior control is\r\n    imminent.... The critical\r\n    point of behavior control, in effect, is sneaking up on mankind\r\n    without his self-conscious realization that a crisis is at hand.\r\n    Man will... never self-consciously know that it has happened.\" [16] This statement\r\n  by Professor Raymond\r\n  Houghton points to the effectiveness of today's sophisticated version of the old Hegelian dialectic process -- the heart of the Soviet\r\n  brainwashing system.  It was infused into the U.S. education even before 1985, when President Reagan\r\n  and Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev signed a formal U.S. - USSR Education Exchange\r\n  Agreement. Finding\r\n  Common Ground fits right in. Its prescribed steps to transformation match the corresponding steps taught by UN leaders, by management guru Peter \r\n\tDrucker, and by church growth leaders such as Rick Warren: 1.\r\n    \"Agree on the Ground Rules\" 2.\r\n  \"Include All of the Stakeholders\" 3. \"Listen to All Sides\" 4.\r\n  \"Work for Comprehensive Policies\" 1.\r\n  \"Agree on the Ground Rules\"\r\n  (Leaders\r\n  agree, others follow): Finding\r\n  Common Ground lists some basic principles for small group dialogues that \r\n\tsound reasonable. Problem is: the words they use hide new meanings that \r\n\tchange the context. \"Rights\" include the politically correct \"right\" not to \r\n\tbe offended by contrary truth or arguments. \"Respect\" includes the \"right\" \r\n\tto be appreciated and affirmed, no matter how irrational or unbiblical one's \r\n\tbeliefs. Responsibility, among other things, refers to the obligation to \r\n\tfollow the new social guidelines. Group members are held accountable, not to \r\n\tpersonal convictions, but to ambiguous and open-ended \"rules\" such as these: \"These principles are the ground rules within which we negotiate our\r\n  differences  At the heart of these\r\n  principles, are the three Rs of religious liberty: Rights Responsibilities\r\n  Respect. If\r\n  these civic ground rules are in place, then all sides come to the \r\n  table prepared to take responsibility to protect the rights of others and to\r\n  debate differences with civility and respect Hidden in these \r\n\tphrases is the understanding that absolute facts and uncompromising faith in\r\n  God's Word are not appropriate in the consensus process. Words that imply that your beliefs\r\n  might be more true than other beliefs could offend the group. Therefore, participants\r\n  may freely share their\r\n  thoughts and feelings, but not their uncompromising convictions. In this\r\n  context, it makes perfect sense that Charles Haynes and Warren Nord would emphasize the\r\n  law that backs this rule: the courts have made it clear that public schools cannot \r\n\tteach students that the Bible is true . [17] In his online\r\n  article, Educators,\r\n  theologians agree on Bible-teaching guidelines for public schools ,\r\n  Mr. Haynes rephrases this essential understanding: Supernatural\r\n  occurrences and divine action described in the Bible may not be taught as historical\r\n  fact . This\r\n  policy is as important to the new international education program (see Mind\r\n  Control ) as it is to Mr. Haynes and the Freedom Forum. Back in 1989, Dr. Shirley\r\n  McCune summarized this policy in her keynote speech at the Governors Conference on\r\n  Education: The revolution in curriculum is that we no longer are teaching facts to children. We no longer see the teaching of facts and information\r\n  as the primary outcome of education. [18] \"What\r\n  will take the place of logic, fact and analysis\r\n  in the coming age?\" This rhetorical question was raised by Dr.\r\n  Donald A. Cowan, president emeritus of the University of Dallas. His revealing answer\r\n  exposes an important step toward the new consensus: \"The central way of\r\n  thought for this new era will be imagination....\r\n  Imagination will be the active, creative\r\n  agent of culture, transforming brute materials to a higher, more knowable state.\" [19] Why is the\r\n  imagination so important to the new way of thinking? Because, unlike fact and faith, the\r\n  imagination can be manipulated through all kinds of stories, myths, and images. By\r\n  putting \"teaching about the Bible\" into a context teeming with timeless myths\r\n  and inter-faith idealism, God's Word becomes little more than just another myth, a\r\n  collection of stories -- one that may seem far less noble than other, less honest,\r\n  \"sacred\" books. 2.\r\n  \"Include All of the Stakeholders\" Remember\r\n  the UNESCO goal: solidarity. To reach this goal, its worldwide education system must\r\n  involve everyone -- young and old -- in the consensus process. To end separatism, every\r\n  mind must be molded to fit the new paradigm. Each person must learn to think\r\n  collectively and follow the group -- which in turn must be manipulated by a trained\r\n  facilitator. Finding Common Ground echoes this aim: If agreements and policies are to inspire broad support in the community, all\r\n  stakeholders must be fully represented in the discussion....\" To help\r\n  schools deal with resistance from Christian parents, it offers this advice,\r\n  When\r\n  school boards or administrators reach out to critics particularly religious\r\n  conservatives, they must look beyond media stereotypes and identify those\r\n  representatives most interested in dialogue and consensus. Engaging\r\n  your \"enemies\" in the consensus process is vital to the new global management\r\n  system. That's why the same advice is emphasized in strategy reports from the United\r\n  Nations , from the President's Council on Sustainable Development, from the U.S.\r\n  Department of Education (See The U.N. Plan for Your Community ),\r\n  and from Church Growth managers across the country. Linda\r\n  Grenz has won the praise of Charles Haynes. She wrote the Doubleday Pocket Bible Guide for the National Bible Association at the\r\n  request of its vice chairman, Charles Stetson. Her management program, Dynamic\r\n  Strategic Planning is a method of\r\n  effectively pursuing a goal or goals in a rapidly changing world.\" [It]\r\n  is an ongoing process of planning that enables a congregation to make\r\n  plans but also to adapt and change.  In\r\n  fact, the underlying assumption is that the plans will change and that they must\r\n  change if the Church is to be effective in today's world. \" UNESCO\r\n  leaders would smile. In the 1993 report, Education and Human Development, they wrote that UNESCO\r\n  Education is aimed at two essential goals: SOCIALIZATION : \r\n  Education for\r\n  all the world's citizens is essential because education is the principal means\r\n  for preparing people to participate effectively in the development of their communities\r\n  . TRAINING FOR GLOBAL WORKFORCE : Education\r\n  must prepare the citizens of today to live and work in a world in which the only\r\n  constant will be change. \"All\r\nthe world's citizens\" naturally includes parents. So it makes sense that Mr. Haynes\r\nand Mr. Nord, writing for the Communitarian Network, echo our Department of Education's\r\ngoal of involving all parents in the consensus process. In their section on \"Parental\r\n  Rights and Responsibilities,\" they write: \"A\r\n  civil public school is also one that recognizes, in the words of the Statement\r\n  of Principles, that parents have 'the primary responsibility for the upbringing\r\n  of their children, including education.' This means that parents\r\n  should be informed and involved when the school addresses religion and religious\r\n  liberty.\" That\r\n  statement may sound innocent enough, but it tells us that Haynes is working right along\r\n  with our Department of Education on involving parents in the new \"seamless\"\r\n  system of \"Lifelong Learning.\" As Professor John Goodlad said, \r\n\t\"Enlightened social engineering is required.... Parents and the general \r\n\tpublic must be reached also, otherwise, children and youth enrolled in \r\n\tglobally oriented programs may find themselves in conflict with values \r\n\tassumed in the home.\" [20] 3. \"Listen to All Sides\" Finding\r\n  Common Ground tells participating schools that... \"Establishing\r\n  a climate where people listen to one another requires that we go beyond labels and\r\n  rebuild trust.  Putting aside labels and stereotypes and taking seriously the\r\n  position of the other side are the starting points for genuine dialogue. That\r\n  sounds good until you apply the ground rules that create a climate of intimidation for\r\n  all politically incorrect beliefs and facts. Since unpopular beliefs might offend the\r\n  group, dissenting voices are often silenced or minimized in the group's concluding\r\n  opinion or \"common ground.\" 4.\r\n  \"Work for Comprehensive Policies\" Finding\r\n  Common Ground , encourages teachers to  begin\r\n  the search for common ground with the areas where agreement is most likely to be\r\n  achieved Once the first agreement is reached, a foundation is created for\r\n  consideration of more divisive questions. It\r\n  makes sense, doesn't it. Once a group has built a measure of programmed\r\n  \"trust\" and established pattern of compromise and consensus on small issues,\r\n  its far easier to compromise on bigger issues. Eventually, no one dares think or\r\n  conclude any significant issue without considering the feelings of the group. Few now\r\n  dare dissent for fear of violating the group standard for supportive relationships. Follow\r\n  God's unchanging guidelines Using\r\n  Charles Haynes approach to \"teaching about the Bible,\" would Christian\r\n  children learn to stand firm, as God instructs, on the basic -- but politically\r\n  incorrect -- truths of the Gospel? For the likely answer, ponder these differences \r\n\t-- take to heart God's Word, our weapon against the forces of deception and \r\n\tdarkness:"
