There was a lot of interest in our stall, delegates were\r\nkeen to hear about events in Latin America and we had some very interesting\r\ndiscussions. We also made some important new links for the campaign with\r\nseveral delegates agreeing to organise film screenings in their colleges. Fringe meeting We held a joint fringe meeting, with Justice For Columbia\r\nand the Cuban Ambassador in the conference hall on Saturday evening. The\r\nattendance, of around 35, was not bad considering it was cut across to some\r\nextent by the late finish of conference and other meetings taking place at the\r\nsame time. Zelmys Dominguez, Political Counsellor of the Cuban Embassy\r\nspoke first and highlighted the role that Cuba has played in helping other\r\ncountries around the world develop their health and education systems by\r\nproviding teachers and doctors. This has been very important in Venezuela. She\r\nalso explained that US imperialism has been trying to isolate Cuba, and that\r\ninternational labour movement support has been important. The next to speak was Hubert de Jesus Ballesteros, Deputy\r\nLeader of the Fensuagro, the Colombian agricultural workers union, who talked\r\nabout the climate of repression that exists for trade unionists in Colombia. He\r\nexplained that assassination of leaders and activists is a standard way for the\r\nbosses to deal with the unions, and even ‘respectable’ multinationals are\r\nimplicated in this. Noting that there are stark contrasts in Latin America, from\r\nthe severe repression of Colombia to the situation in Venezuela that is\r\nstrongly in favour of the working class, the chair, NEC member Maire Daley,\r\nintroduced Jorge Martin from the Hands Off Venezuela campaign. Jorge talked about recent pressure by US imperialism to\r\nisolate Venezuela diplomatically. A recent article by Otto Reich, describes\r\nCastro and Chavez as an axis of evil, while high profile trips to Latin America\r\nby Condoleeza Rice and Donald Rumsfelt have attempted to stir up opposition.\r\nThese attempts have so far been unsuccessful. He explained that the masses have been the driving force of\r\nthe revolution at every stage, first in overturning the successful opposition\r\ncoup, then in saving the economy by taking over the running of industry at the\r\ntime of the bosses lockout and finally in defeating the opposition during the\r\nrecall referendum. He went on to list the social gains of the revolution which\r\ninclude the nationalisation of certain factories under workers control, the\r\ndistribution of unused land to the peasants and the extensive social programme\r\nwhich is introducing universal healthcare and eradicating illiteracy. There was a lively discussion that focused on how best to\r\nbuild links with the workers in each of these countries, especially Colombia\r\nand Venezuela, and on what we can do to help. The meeting helped to prepare the\r\nground for the motion before conference to support Venezuela. Conference motion The motion on Venezuela was heard in the international\r\ndiscussion on Monday morning. The mover of the motion, Darrel Cozens from West\r\nMidlands region, drew attention to the gains that the revolution has meant for\r\nordinary people, pointing to the social programmes that are bringing health and\r\neducation to young and old. He also explained that Venezuela has become a\r\nbeacon of hope to the oppressed across Latin America, noting especially the\r\nrecent demonstrations and uprisings in Bolivia over multinationals exploiting\r\nthe country’s gas reserves. The speakers on the motion were very well received and the\r\nmotion unanimously supported. This opens the way for greater links between this\r\nunion and those in Venezuela and this will be further advanced by the\r\ncommitment to participate in a joint union delegation to Venezuela to see the\r\nrevolution in action. The conference was a step forward for the campaign and has\r\ngiven us many new links and points off support to build upon. The task now is\r\nto follow up on these and use them to spread the word about the Bolivarian\r\nRevolution and Hands Off Venezuela, to which NATFHE already agree to affiliate\r\nat last year’s conference. Text of the motion: This conference congratulates and supports the Bolivarian\r\nRevolution and the Venezuelan government for utilising the country’s wealth and\r\nresources for reforms to benefit the working class, the poor and the landless. Conference views with alarm however the bellicose statements\r\nbeing made by the USA and its allies Columbia and the financial oligarchy in\r\nVenezuela which pose a real threat to these reforms. Conference agrees to join with the NUJ to organise a trade\r\nunion delegation to Venezuela in solidarity with the Revolution and to support\r\na delegation to the World Youth Festival in Caracas in August 2005.
