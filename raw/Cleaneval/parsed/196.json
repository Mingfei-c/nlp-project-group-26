More than 30 student, faculty and staff volunteers from St. Lawrence University \r\n    spent part of the semester break assisting with recovery and cleanup efforts \r\n    at \"Ground Zero,\" the site of the September 11 collapse of the World \r\n    Trade Center's twin towers in New York City. From January 6 through 12, members \r\n    of the group worked at two locations near the site: the coroner's office on 1st Ave., where rescue workers may bring the remains \r\n    of someone who, through DNA tests, has been identified as missing; and \"Ground \r\n    Zero\" itself, where a tent has been set up for volunteers to report for \r\n    assignments from coordinators working with the Salvation Army. Depending upon \r\n    those assignments, volunteers are dispatched to various sites where workers \r\n    are most needed, during the 3 to 11 p.m. shift. St. Lawrence volunteers have \r\n    been provided free lodging at a nearby YMCA facility. The project originated \r\n    at a North Country Scholar Day admissions event in November; attendees included \r\n    Disaster Relief Project Director for the Salvation Army Randy Widrick, a Colton, \r\n    New York, resident who has been in New York City since September 13. On-campus \r\n    coordination was done by St. Lawrence Leadership Academy Project Director Anne Townsend .

Town and Gown St. Lawrence has formally requested that the Village of Canton annex four \r\n    University-owned properties on the north side of East Main Street, making \r\n    them part of the village. All are now part of the Town of Canton. In a letter \r\n    to Canton Mayor Robert Wells, Vice President for Administrative Operations \r\n    Thomas Coakley stated, \"Adding these properties would appropriately add \r\n    to the tax base of the Village and that is, in fact, our objective in making \r\n    this request.\" Should the request be granted, the University will also request a zoning change \r\n    for the parcels, from their present Town of Canton designation as commercial, \r\n    to the village's \"highest permissible residential zoning.\" Coakley \r\n    pointed out in the letter that the properties in question all have deed restrictions \r\n    that limit their use to residential purposes. The University has also requested that four additional properties be removed \r\n    from tax rolls, and be designated as tax-exempt properties. They are: 21 Elm Street - Viebranz Scholar residence 7 Maple Street - Safety and Security Officer 11 Maple Street - Office for Corporate and Foundation Relations 127 Miner Street - To be a vacant lot \"These are properties that we utilize more directly in the operation \r\n    of the University,\" Coakley's letter states. Town Supervisor David Button has referred the request to Town Attorney Charles \r\n    Nash, who plans to report to the town board in February with a recommendation.
