      "text": "In this passage, taken from his 1776 book\n\"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\"\nAdam Smith set out the mechanism by which he felt economic society\noperated. Each individual strives to become wealthy \"intending\nonly his own gain\" but to this end he must exchange what he\nowns or produces with others who sufficiently value what he has\nto offer; in this way, by division of labour and a free market,\npublic interest is advanced. Smith is often regarded as the father of economics, and his writings\nhave been enormously influential. Nowadays, \"invisible hand\" explanations\nare invoked to explain all sorts of phenomena, from scientific progress\nto environmental degradation. In the modern context, mathematicians\nstudy \"invisible hand\" processes as part of Game Theory, the branch of\nmathematics that deals with payoffs and strategies (see Game\nTheory and the Cuban Missile Crisis )\nin Issue 13 of Plus . Smith was profoundly religious, and saw the\n\"invisible hand\" as the mechanism by which a benevolent God\nadministered a universe in which human happiness was\nmaximised. He made it clear in his writings that quite\nconsiderable structure was required in society before the \ninvisible hand mechanism could work efficiently. For example,\nproperty rights must be strong, and there must be widespread\nadherence to moral norms, such as prohibitions against theft and\nmisrepresentation. Theft was, to Smith, the worst crime of all,\neven though a poor man stealing from a rich man may increase\noverall happiness.\nHe even went so far as to say that the purpose of government\nis to defend the rich from the poor. Here is a description of the way Smith imagined the universe operates: There is a benevolent deity who administers the world in such\na way as to maximise human happiness. In order to do this he has created humans with a nature\nthat leads them to act in a certain way. The world as we know it is pretty much perfect, and everyone is \nabout equally happy. In particular, the rich are no happier than the poor. Although this means we should all be happy with our lot in life,\nour nature (which, remember, was created by God for the purpose\nof maximising happiness) leads us to think that we would be\nhappier if we were wealthier. This is a good thing, because it leads us to struggle to become \nwealthier, thus increasing the sum total of human happiness via\nthe mechanisms of exchange and division of labour. It is clear why Smith says that moral norms are necessary for such\na system to work - in order for exchange to proceed, \ncontracts must be enforceable, people must have good\naccess to information about the products and services\navailable, and the rule of law must hold."

      "text": "Nowadays, something much more general is meant by the expression\n\"invisible hand\". An invisible hand process is one in which\nthe outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralised way,\nwith no explicit agreements between the\nacting agents. The second essential\ncomponent is that the process is not intentional. The agents' aims\nare not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome, which is\na byproduct of those aims. The process should work even\nwithout the agents having any knowledge of it. This is why the process\nis called invisible. The system in which the invisible hand is most often assumed\nto work is the free market. \nAdam Smith assumed that consumers choose for the lowest price,\nand that entrepreneurs choose for the highest rate of profit.\nHe asserted that by thus making their excess or insufficient demand known through\nmarket prices, consumers \"directed\" entrepreneurs' investment money to\nthe most profitable industry. Remember that this is the industry \nproducing the goods most highly\nvalued by consumers, so in general economic well-being is increased. One extremely positive aspect of a market-based\neconomy is that it forces people to think about what\nother people want. Smith saw this as a large part of\nwhat was good about the invisible hand mechanism.\nHe identified two ways to obtain\nthe help and co-operation of other people, upon which we all depend constantly.\nThe first way is to appeal to the benevolence and goodwill of others. \nTo do this a person must often act in a servile and fawning way, which Smith\nfound repulsive, and he claimed it generally meets\nwith very limited success. The second way is to\nappeal instead to other people's self-interest. In one of his most famous quotes:"

He will be more likely to prevail if he can\ninterest their self-love in his favour, and show them that it is for\ntheir own advantage to do for him what he requires of them.\nWhoever offers to another a bargain of any kind, proposes to do\nthis. Give me what I want, and you shall have this which you want, is\nthe meaning of every such offer; and it is the manner that we\nobtain from one another the far greater part of those good offices which\nwe stand in need of. It is not from the benevolence of the\nbutcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from\ntheir regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not\nto their humanity but to their self-love."

      "text": "For Smith, to propose an exchange is to attempt to show another that what\nyou can do, or what you have, can be of use to the other. When you carry\nout the exchange, it means the other person\nrecognises that what you can do or that what you\nhave is of value. This is why so much of a person's self-esteem is bound up\nin their job - a well-paid job is supposed to be a sign that others value your\ncontribution and find it worth exchanging their own resources for."

No doubt every reader can see that it describes\nthe way that things really work on many occasions, and, whether we \nfind it palatable or not, we probably all recognise the truth of Smith's assertion that \npaying for your dinner is a more reliable way to get it than\nappealing to the benevolence of others. But, even assuming all the correct conditions, does the invisible hand theory\nreally lead to the maximisation of human economic wellbeing\nin some sense, as Smith asserts?\nThis is where mathematics, in the form of Game Theory, can provide us with\nsome insights."

      "text": "The \"Prisoner's Dilemma\" is a very famous \"paradox\" in Game Theory.\nIt describes two people in a simple situation, acting in an informed manner,\nboth attempting to maximise\ntheir wellbeing, and yet making choices that lead to an \nunnecessarily poor outcome for both. Two people, who are suspected of being accomplices in a crime, \nare held prisoner in separate, non-communicating cells.\nThe police visit each prisoner, and tell both that  \nif neither confesses, each will be sentenced to two years in jail.\nHowever, if exactly one prisoner confesses, implicating each other, the one\nwho confesses will get off scot-free as a reward, and the other, who didn't \nconfess, will receive a punitive sentence of five years. \nIf each confesses and implicates the other, both will be \nsentenced to three years. What should a prisoner in this situation do? \nSuppose that the other prisoner doesn't\nconfess. Then the best course of action is to confess, \nand go free. Even if the other prisoner\ndoes confess, it will be better to have done likewise - \nat least the sentence will be lower.\nBoth prisoners will reason thus, so both will confess and\nend up serving sentences of three years - even\nthough, if both had remained silent, both would have served \nsentences of only two years. It may not be immediately clear what the relevance of the Prisoner's Dilemma\nis to Smith's theory of the Invisible Hand. In fact, it has a number of\nimplications for economic behaviour.

    },

      "text": "We can think of the prisoners as being asked to decide\nwhether to keep a contract they have made with each other\n(remain silent) or to default (confess and betray the other). \nSimilar choices have to be made all the time in economic society.\nWhen two people freely agree to exchange \ngoods or services to their mutual benefit, each must\ndecide whether to try to cheat the other by defaulting, or handing \nover counterfeit goods,\nor whether to act in good faith and risk the\nother party defaulting. Obviously, both parties \nare better off if neither default\nthan if both default - after all, we suppose they \nwillingly contracted with each\nother - but each would like to get\nsomething for nothing, and each is\nafraid the other will feel the same. The result may well be\nthat the parties are unable to carry out the exchange\nas arranged, and both lose out. The reason we don't see this behaviour too often is because we live in a \nsociety where courts can enforce contracts. This reduces the fear of \nthe other party defaulting, and makes it easier to hand over goods\nahead of receiving whatever is to be exchanged for them.\nIn illegal exchanges, for example,\nreceiving stolen goods, default is more common, and rather difficult \nfor criminals to guard against. Enforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from someone \nelse - in democratic societies, the\ncourts on behalf of the government and the people. \nBut courts and prisons and police \ncost money and most\nof the costs fall on people who were not party \nto the contract in the first place -\nwho are therefore paying for a service that doesn't \ndirectly benefit themselves.\nSuch courts fall into the category of \"public good\" - \nwe are all better off in a society\nwhere the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained \nby any invisible hand mechanism.\nCourts are set up deliberately to carry out a public good; \nand, although they may not always work\nthe way they are intended to, there is nothing \nunintended about their use to enforce\ncontracts."

However,\nif other people seek and gain subsidies, anyone who doesn't\nbother trying to do the same for themselves\nwill end up subsidising others while receiving no subsidies\nthemselves. This fear may force large numbers of people\nto spend their time lobbying the government \nfor subsidies, rather than\nsimply engaging in more profitable activities - a classic example\nof the\nPrisoner's Dilemma, and one over which no court has jurisdiction. A very similar situation occurs regarding monopolies.\nSince pretty much every producer is a consumer, it is probably to \neverybody's benefit overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by \nmonopolising their market; however, attempting to enforce a monopoly can be very\nattractive to individual producers.

The results of such analyses will not be the only factor\nin deciding whether societies move towards or away\nfrom laissez-faire economics (\"laissez-faire\" means\n\"let alone\" and is shorthand for leaving things to the\ninvisible hand).\nPolitical will, whether the world becomes more peaceful or less,\nand the practicality of any alternatives will also be factors.\nAlternative systems tend to require\nmuch more intervention and more stringent rules. \nIn the real world, such rules \nautomatically introduce more and more opportunities for\nmistakes and corruption, which might mean that another system,\neven if better in principle, would be worse in practice. Perhaps the strongest reason for leaving the allocation\nof effort and reward to the invisible hand is that\nwhen it misappropriates\ngoods, it is likely to be\non a small scale.
