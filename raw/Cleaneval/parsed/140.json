      "text": "August 2002 Hi, I have a 7 1/2 month old who starts out sleeping on her back, \nthen rolls to the side and onto her stomach.  Sometimes she's \nable to turn back over without a fuss, but lately she's been \nrolling into positions such that she gets ''stuck'' at an angle in \nthe crib--jammed into a corner, turned perpendicular to the \nsides, or an arm thrust under the soft bumper through the crib \nrails.  She wakes up and cries, so I've been going in to turn her \nover. What can my husband and I do to prevent this?  I don't like the \nidea of putting cushions in to wedge her in, yet she is getting \nstuck several times a night.  Should we consider putting the crib \nmattress on the floor in the corner and putting barriers on the \nother two sides?  Has anyone else had this problem and found a \nsolution?  Thank you in advance for any suggestions!\nJean When that started happening with my son at about the same age, I \nremoved the soft bumpers and it was resolved.  His crib looks \nmore like a jail, but he can maneuver much better in there now.\nmolly Perhaps using a Graco PACK-N-PLAY instead of a regular crib would\nsolve your problem. The sides are made of a soft and flexible\nmesh material. Your baby might not even wake up if she rolled\ninto the side of it.\nMEG"

      "text": "July 2002 My daughter is standing at naptime and bedtime, even when \nutterly exhausted. She is sometimes happily standing \nholding the rail, but this soon becomes screaming her head \noff. It's pretty clear that it's that innate urge to get to vertical \nwhich has control over her. We don't do well co-sleeping, so \nthat is out of the question. But it'd be nice to hear from folks \nwho have gone through this. She is a spirited physical girl \nwho is keenly attentive to every sound and visual stimuli (i.e. \nit's never been too easy to get her to bed in the first place.) \nWhen she is walking around holding our hands or onto \nfurniture, she is able to sit herself down well without falling. \nAnd last but not least, she appears to be in another spurt of \nteething. Help! Help!\nMadeleine My husband and I experienced the same thing with our daughter \nstarting when she was about eight months old.  She was nornally \na great sleeper.  Our situation seemed identical to yours: we do \nnot co-sleep with her.  The first thing we did was adjusted her \nschedule of napping, so that there was more time between naps.  \nWe found that being consistant and sticking to our routine has \nhelped a lot.  When we put her down, we go through our little \nroutine and we lay her down in her crib and leave the room.  \nAfter five minutes, if she is crying (and usually standing up) \nwe check on her and lay her back down, rub her head a couple \ntimes, but do not say anything and do not pick her up or hold \nher.  She would usually get back up and cry. We wait longer (7-\n10 minutes) before we go in and lay her back down.  We repeat \nthe process and extend the time between going in the room.  The \nfirst week was hard.  It would take about an hour just to get \nher to sleep.  We are first time parents and she is not a fussy \nbaby, so hearing her cry just broke our hearts.   It has taken \nabout a month but now when we put her down, if she gets up and \ncries, we usually have to lay her back down once and she falls \nasleep.  I hope this helps.  It has really helped us a lot.\nAmy Oh Boy, I remember this all too well.  Let me see, where to \nbegin?  Well, my daughter who is now 12 is and was the same, \nspirited, intelligent, commanding and demanding!  And I gave in \nevery time.  Why?  Because I did not believe in the ''books'' \nadvice that if you just ignore it the infant/toddler will stop \nand just go to sleep on their own after say a week.. I actually \ntested this out, at 3 months, at 6, 9, 1 year, 3, years, 5 years, \n8 years.  Perhaps you are wondering if I had incompleter \nboundaries or a soft heart.  Yes to a soft heart, I love my child \nmore than myself but I desperately wanted sleep.  I can not begin \nto list all the night lights, snuggles, book reading, vampire \nsalts, etc. we went through!  None worked for us.  I recomend \nreading ''Raisng your spirited child'' right away, it was a great \nhelp to me to know that there are lot's of children out there who \nhave this temperant and viewed in the right way, it is a gift to \nthe holder of the personality.  My daughter and I were able to \nsleep by me getting a queen size bed and I slept there with her \nin her room for 10 years!  I tried everything else, including at \n5 trying to lock her in her room out of desperation to sleep with \nmy husband who was admantly against co sleeping.  She is still \nintense and keenly aware and always will be.  This poses certain \nhuge hurdles of growth on my part but I see her blossoming into a \ncreative, vibrant, self sufficent young teen.  Artistic and \ncaring. I wouldn't trade her for anything!!\nI think you got the best of the bunch, just give in to the \ndemands of the personality, after all this is why we are mothers, \nno matter how hard and believe me, there were many nights when I \nsat by her bed and cried myself to sleep before I got the \nmatteress.\nmscwalker What we did was practice getting from a standing to a sitting \nposition through play.  I would hold my baby's hands and pull \nher up saying ''baby UP'', then I'd lower her onto her little \nbooty saying ''baby DOWN''.  We started when she was about 4 \nmonths old, but I'm sure you can do it with an 8-month old.  I \ndid this specifically so that she wouldn't get stuck in a \nstanding position in her crib at night and causing problems with \nher putting herself back to sleep.  Fortunately, I read \na ''getting your baby to sleep'' book that alerted me to the \nproblem before it began.\nChristina There have been times when my son was exhausted and \nresisting sleep, so I put him in the crib to fall asleep, \nalthough it upset him (and me).  The nice thing about a crib \nis that it's designed to be safe.  He fell asleep standing up, \nleaning on the bars, more than once, after crying for a while.  \nWhen he fell down, he did not hurt himself, and it only \nawakened him slightly--then he went back to a deeper sleep \n(I watched him do this once).  Other times he was practically \nasleep standing up (after crying for a while), and did not get \nup again when we lay him down.  My son has gone through \nseveral different stages in his falling-asleep habits, some of \nthem quite brief, so don't despair!  He is now 18 months old, \nand rarely complains when put to bed, tired but awake, for a \ndaytime nap or a night's sleep.  And in our case it was \ncertainly true that the first 2 or 3 times of crying to sleep were \nthe most painful for all parties.  After that, when we had to do \nit (he was frequently asleep when put into bed, I admit), he \noften only cried for 5 or 10 minutes (often intermittently).  \nSince your daughter is easily disturbed by noises, you might \nwant to try using some soothing music that will mask \nnoises from outside her room (your footsteps, etc.), that \nmight keep her from relaxing into sleep, at bedtime--start it \nbefore you leave, and leave it playing when you go.  We have \nbeen using the same music for many months as part of the \nbedtime routine, and I started using it for naptime, too, more \nrecently--it's definitely helpful.  And if the teething is keeping \nher from sleeping, you might want to try Tylenol, in the \ndosage recommended by your pediatrician, on nights when \nit's really bothering her.  I was worried (about starting a \nhabit, I guess) the first time I did this, but found that I only \nended up using it a few times.\nLisa We worked with a very intuitive baby coach ...
