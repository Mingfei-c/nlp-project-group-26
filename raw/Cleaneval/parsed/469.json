      "text": "Ensure your car is tuned and serviced regularly. The worst polluters on our roads tend to be old cars. If you do drive an older car, help the environment by making sure it is tuned according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Reduce your speed. Driving more slowly reduces fuel consumption. In fact, travelling at 110kph uses up to 25% more fuel than cruising at 90kph. For city driving, 60kph is the most fuel efficient speed. Drive smoothly. Avoid hard accelerating and heavy braking as it uses up a lot more fuel. Travel lightly and remove unnecessary items from your car to reduce weight - those golf clubs in the back and the surfboard on the roof create extra load and reduce aerodynamics. This will improve your fuel consumption and reduce emissions. Make sure your tyres are inflated to the correct pressure, as soft tyres cause higher fuel consumption. Filling up past the first click of the fuel nozzle means that fuel can be lost through the overflow pipe when you accelerate or go around corners. Consider how much you use your air conditioner - it can use up to 10% extra fuel. Avoid peak-hour. If traffic is stationery, switch off the engine, even if you stop for a short time. Idling wastes fuel. Car-pool wherever possible, use public transport or ride a bicycle. Motorbikes and powered scooters are a very fuel-efficient form of transport, with reduced environmental impact."
