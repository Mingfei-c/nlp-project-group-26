      "text": "HYDRANTMAN'S \nRULES ORDINANCES ---oo0oo--- Object of Installing \nSystem To reduce the fire and conflagration hazard to a \nminimum. First: To practically dispense with the use of steam portable fire \nengines. Second: To supply sufficient water at the scene of an incipient fire, to \nextinguish it in the shortest possible time. Third: To quickly concentrate large volumes \nof water on area in which a fire may have reached dangerous proportions. Fourth: To \nfurnish in emergency as much water as can be used to advantage by the fire \ndepartment. The Reason Gravity System is \nSuperior This method of supply possesses decided advantages over \nall others because of its positiveness and economy of operation and the short time required \nto get the water on a fire. It is not necessary to telephone to a central station and start \npumps, or to make connections to fire boats. And it possesses none of the various \nuncertainties inherent to complicated mechanical equipment. Putting Twin Peaks \nReservoir in service, it will increase static pressure at base 168 pound to square inch in \nlower zone. Advantages The advantages \nbriefly are as follows: First: It eliminates steam fire engines which hitherto have been \nthe main reliance. It is thus a measure of great economy. It also reduces excitement which \nis important near schools and hospitals. Second: It reduces the additional alarms and \nnumbers of companies and apparatus required. Third: The supply of water is better and \nmore powerful. Saltwater could be had on short notice in case of emergency from two \nsaltwater pumping stations. Should this supply prove inadequate, it can be increased by \ntwo fire boats. Fourth: Stretches are shorter, meaning quicker work and greater \neconomy of hose and men. Fifth: It greatly reduces \ninsurance rates . Within a number of years (the system) will pay for \nitself. High Pressure Hydrants The capacity of \na high pressure hydrant depends upon the amount of pressure at the main. The capacity \nwhen the pressure is at its highest amounts to about 3,000 gals per minute. The diameter on \nthe various valves on a high pressure hydrant are main valves, pilot valve 3'' diameter \nsquare independent 3 1/2 reduced to 3 inches with reducers. With the exception of the one \nfacing street which is 3 1/2 inches. The pilot valve is a small valve placed in the center \nof the main valve, it is used as a bypass. The diameter of the main valve is seven inches. \nThe service area: 38 square inches. The action of the valve is in a downward direction \nwhen opening, and the movement is against the course or pressure of water entering the \nstandpipe. Under these circumstances it would be very difficult to make an opening on a \nhigh pressure hydrant. Therefore, the object of the pilot valve is to meet these \nconditions so that an opening can be affected in any high pressure. The pilot, which is \ninside the main valve, equalizes the pressure above and below the main valve and has a 3 \ninch diameter and a surface of 7 square inches. The pilot in the main valve is so \narranged that the first turn of the stem operates the small valve inside only, and therefore \nallows the water to pass the pilot valve and the main valve into the stand pipe of the \nhydrant. Capacity: 9950 gals per minute, with three outlets at 150 pounds pressure \nexclusive of friction loss. Methods of Using \nSystem Pressure in Jones St. Tank lower zone: If greater \npressure is required, a signal is sent calling for Ashbury Pressure or from Twin Peaks \nreservoir. If Jones St. pressure is not sufficient, Gateman at Jones St. operates proper \nvalves to permit water from Ashbury or Twin Peaks to flow direct into lower zone. If \nTwin Peaks is called for, gateman at Ashbury Tank operates proper valves and permits \nflow from Twin Peaks direct into mains. In connecting to a hydrant, see that the \nindependent valve is closed. Connect regulating valve and see that it is shut off. Open \nking valve, open independent outlet valve. Wait for orders to turn on water. Operate \nregulating valve according to pressure ordered. A Description of the \nHigh Pressure System The high pressure system consists of lines or \nmains, diameter of same varying from 10 to 20 inches extending about 9 1/2 miles \nthroughout the congested value district, the important retail, wholesale and hotel districts \nand a large part of the residence district. Three-way hydrants are connected to the mains \nwith sublets of 3 1/3 inches, two outlets reduced to 3 inches. 1350 hydrants are used and \n1120 gates so placed that when repairs are necessary only a small portion of the system \nmay be out of service. Provision is made to cut out those portions of the city where an \nearthquake would by most likely to damage the system. The system is fed from \nthe following sources: Twin Peaks reservoir at an elevation of 758 feet at water \nlevel capacity of 10,500,000 gallons. Ashbury Tank at an elevation of 494 feet at water \nlevel capacity of 500,000 gallons. Jones St. Tank at an elevation of 369 feet at water \nlevel capacity of 750,000 gallons. The system is divided into two zones. Jones St. \nTank supplies the lower zone. Ashbury Tank supplies the upper zone. Static pressure at the \nbase of the lower zone is 160 pounds to the square inch. With Ashbury pressure on, the \nlower zone pressure at city base is 214 pounds. Twin Peaks pressure at city base would be \nabout 328 pounds to square inch. Two saltwater pumping stations with 10,800 gallons \nper minute capacity for each. These stations have four steam multi-stage turbine pumps, \none located at the foot of Van Ness Avenue and one at Second and Townsend Sts may also \npump into the system. Two fire boats each with a capacity of 10,000 gallons per minute \nmay pump into the system from manifolds, each with ten inlets located at the foot of \nWashington and the foot of Powell St. The sources of supply are Spring Valley Water \nCompany and S.F. Bay. The Spring Valley water is mainly taken from Clarendon \nHeight through Ashbury Pumping Station and pumped to Twin Peaks by two centrifugal \npumps driven by two 60-horsepower electric motors which are capable of delivering 700 \ngallons a minute each against 125 pound head. Ashbury Tank, elevation 465 feet, is filled \nby gravity from Spring Valley Clarendon Heights tank taken through 6-inch pipe, elevation \n600 feet. Jones St. Tank, elevation 334 feet, is mainly filled from Ashbury Tank. In \nemergency Jones St. Tank could be filled by the Spring Valley Tank, Clay St. at an \nelevation of 375 feet. Alarms are received at all reservoir pumping stations and fire \nboats over a circuit being direct on a punch register. These are termed high-pressure \ncalls. Pumping stations, to pump capacity against 335 pounds pressure per square inch, \nare provided with sufficient fuel and fresh water to continue 7 hours. Fire boats are able \nto pump 10,000 gallons a minute against 150 pounds pressure or 5,000 gallons a minute \nagainst 325 pounds pressure, per square inch. It (the high pressure system) protects all \nthe section of the city located within the following boundaries and can be used for some \ndistance outside this district: All that section of the city east of Golden Gate park from \nmains on Clayton and Ashbury St. Western Addition: Extreme westerly main on \nDevisadero St. running to Pacific Ave. to Van Ness Ave. to Polk St. Along Van Ness Ave. \nto the Bay, that section east of Van Ness Ave. south of Market west so far as Castro and \nsouth so far as 29th. Twenty-Sixth along Harrison and Folsom, Berry Street and the bay \nshore. A short extension runs from 8th and Townsend to 15th and Kansas to a dead \nend. Special valves for reinforcing the lower zone are at Seventeenth west of Castro and \nMarket St. west of Second. These have 16 gates. The two gates would be ordered open \nin case of an extra large fire, or fires when the department was using more water than the \n18-inch pipe leaving Jones St. Tank could supply to the lower zone. Under ordinary \nconditions, Twin Peaks and Ashbury Reservoirs are put in service to Lower Jones through \nmanifolds in the gate house at Jones Tank. The extra pressure of Ashbury or Twin Peaks \nwill put Jones St. Tank out of service automatically. Fire \nBoats Two pumps installed in each boat. Each pump has 2 unit \nmulti-state turbine type. The casing of some of the pumps will be made sufficiently strong \nto withstand a pressure of 300 pounds per sq. inch. The suction and discharge pipes \nwill be arranged so that each pump may be connected to draw water from the Bay and \ndeliver it into the delivery pipes on the boat, or one pump may deliver from the Bay into the \nsuction of the other at a pressure of 150 pounds per sq.-inch and this pump will increase \nthe pressure to 300 pounds per sq.-inch and discharge into delivery pipes of the \nboat. By this means a pumping set may deliver 4,000 gallons per minute against a \npressure of 150 pounds per sq. inch or 2,000 gallons per minute against a pressure of 300 \npounds per sq. inch.

Water level elevation is 758 feet. Capacity is 10,500,00 gallons. See order from \nChief Engineer about minimum level to be adhered to: 24 feet 6 inches. Maximum level. 25 \nfeet four inches, the overflow point is 25 feet six inches. This reservoir is oval shape at the \nintersection of two streets, viz. 20th and Cole. In the summer, Twin Peaks consumes about \n500,000 gallons a month. When pumping from West to East Reservoir, open gates #7 - \n9 - 33 and #113 under floor plates. Close gates when finished. When pumping from \nEast to West Reservoir open gates #33 - 8 - 10 and 13 under floor \nplates. Ashbury Tank Steel circular tank, \nheight 29 feet, diameter 55 feet, 123 feet around. This tank overflows at 28 feet 3 5/8 \ninches through an el. Looking down, elevation at base 463 feet, water level elevation 495 \nfeet. Pressure at base 214 pounds to square inch. The pumps at Ashbury Station are \ncapable of delivering 740 gals a minute or about 48,000 gallons per hour. Exact \ncapacity of tank: 515.40192 gallons. Jones St. \nTank Located at Jones and Sacramento Sts, reinforced concrete tank \ncircular, elevation at base, 334 feet. Water level elevation 368.5 feet, diameter 60 feet, \nheight 36 feet, pressure at base 160 pounds to sq. inch. The line that supplies the lower \nzone runs down a small street viz. Pleasant St. Exact capacity of tank: 761,425.9200 \ngallons. Lower Zone All land lying beneath the \n150 foot level. At present this zone has about 77 miles of pipe and also gates at all \nintersecting streets. Eight gates divide the upper and lower zone. Lower Zone are is 2 1/4 \nsq. miles provided with 673 hydrants. Upper \nZone Area of Upper Zone is 6 square miles provided with 216 \nhydrants. Main Sizes Mains on the system \nvary from 10 to 20 inches in diameter. 8-inch branch leads to hydrants. Hydrant gates, \nwhere possible, are located on the opposite side of the street from hydrant close to the main \nso as to be accessible in case of emergency. There is laid in system 20-inch pipes that \nact as reservoirs. (They are) on Van Ness Ave., Sutter to Bush, and Market St. between \n6th and 9th Sts. Bypasses on all street gates are operated to the right with right hand \nthreads. Manifolds The purpose of manifolds \nare to feed volume into the system by degrees, thus making operation of gates easy. If \npipeline was not vented while filling same, the air would become compressed and the \npressure of the water entering would work pressure of air up so that it would seek an outlet \nbetween joins and cause the system to leak. Doubling diameter of pipe increases capacity \nfour times. Cast iron pipe is used on high pressure system. Special Operating Gates \nOpen - Seven in Number Location:"

      "text": "Questions that May be \nAsked How would you put a new leather seat in the main valve \nof the hydrant? I would shut off hydrant at hydrant branch gate, unscrew bolts that \nhold bonnet and top plate down. Remove all fittings therefrom. Use wrench that is \nspecially designed for this purpose. Said wrench has a long cylinder and bottom is \nconstructed as to fit the logs of the false bronze seat ring. I would give wrench a few \nturns to the left and unscrew. After this was done, I would pull wrench out of standpipe. \nThen I would pull spindle out of standpipe with valves attached. Take off 2 iron nuts, take \noff hold down nut bronze, remove old leather seat, put new leather seat on screw on \nfittings named above and assemble in same manner. Notify Battalion Chief and 1st \nalarm company. What care and attention do valves, hydrants and man holes \nrequire? Valves and hydrants should be inspected each week; should be \nwiped, oiled, tested and if any leak should be seen around glands, should be taken up or \nrepacked. Hose connections on hydrants should also be inspected and hydrantman should \nbe positive that all threads on same were not jammed so fireman would have no trouble \nconnecting hose. Man holes should be inspected and keep dry, free from water. \nSpindles on all outlets should be made to work freely. By opening independent slide valve \nand keeping main valve closed, it would be possible to know whether main valve seat was \ntight and in good order. To inspect the independent valve, keep same closed and open main \nvalve. Parts of a Gate Valve Body: 2 bronze \nseat rings screwed into casting. Single disc bonnet spindle, stuffing box, gland gears, gear \nbracket, operating nut, indicator stem, elbows and bypass.. Also bushing. If a \nhydrant was not operating properly where would you look for the \ntrouble? I would immediately look for fault in valve seat. It could be \npossible for a small rock or piece of wood to get in between valve and seat. And the same \nmight jam valve so it would not seat properly and case a leak. It would also be noticeable \non top of spindle. If I thought the valve was damaged to any extent, I would install a new \none. If you find a high pressure hydrant broken at its outlet what would you \ndo? I would shut off the gate on the hydrant branch, notify the Battalion Chief \nand 1st alarm company, and also Supt. of system to send me a new hydrant and 2 laborers. \nExcavate down to the foot of the hydrant which is about 5 feet, unscrew studs between the \nfoot of the hydrant and the stand pipe. Lift same out with the aid of a tripoid and install new \none I had received. Test same, notify Batt. Chief of district and 1st alarm company and \nreport same to Supt. of system. How would you drain a portion of the system. \nSay one block for repairs? I would close down 2 gates at the intersecting \nstreets so as to cut off supply in that particular block. Open hydrants when water stopped \nflowing out of hydrants. By this means the section would be dry \ndrained. How would you proceed to fill pipes again? I would \nplug portion of pipe I had tapped. Leave hydrant open to let air escape. Open section gate \nvery low. After I had line full, I would open other section gate. I would know that \nsection was full of solid water when hydrant at highest elevation flowed \nfreely. How would you test a new section of mains and hydrants in trenches \nto determine whether section was tight or not and would stand maximum working \npressure? I would attach a line from a low pressure hydrant and connect to \nsuction of hand pump. Connect a line from discharge hand pump to outlet of high pressure \nhydrant. See that all other hydrants were open to let air escape. Operate low pressure \nhydrant slow after water was coming out of high pressure hydrant. I would close same and \nwork hand pump to pressure required which would be about 450 pounds per sq. inch. \nExamine all joints of pipe and hydrant branches and foot of hydrant. If found the same in \ngood order, I would disconnect hand pump, close high and low pressure hydrants, open \nsection gate and let static head come through. The test hydrant valves and report same in \ngood order, ready for service. Describe the proper method of blowing off a \nhydrant on a crowded or narrow street. I would shut down gate valve, muffle \nhydrant outlet with sack or other cloth material, open hydrant to its full opening and blow it \noff from the gate valve. Describe the process of testing stand pipe, 14 story \nbuilding. I would inspect said Standpipe beginning at basement, ascend \ntoward roof, closely examine all valves and outlets with the exception of valve on roof \nwhich I would open to allow the air to escape. Then I would return to street, connect \nhose to hydrant, to outlet of pump. [Take] another piece of hose from discharge end of \npump to inlet of standpipe Siamese. Turn on water at hydrant when it reached the roof and \nflowed freely through valve on roof. Close roof valve which will give hydrant pressure. \nReturn to pump and work pump until gauge showed required pressure which would be \nabout 300 pounds per square inch. Then examine standpipe. Finding same in good \ncondition, I turned off water at hydrant, release pressure by opening jet cock on \npump. Return to ground floor, open drain valve located at bottom of standpipe. When \nproperly drained, disconnect hose at hydrant to pump, from pump to inlet of standpipe \nSiamese, replaced all caps and plug. Close roof valve and report same. What \nare the duties of a hydrantman with regard to cisterns? He shall examine all \ncisterns in his district once each week. Keep them full of water. See that they are ready for \nimmediate use at all times. If anything should happen to impair their stability, these should \nbe reported to the Battalion Chief of district and Supt. of High Pressure System. There are \n58 cisterns which vary from 18,000 gallons and up. Two cisterns located in Civic Center, \none under each fountain. With the new bond issue there will be 85 reinforced \ncisterns. Explain the purpose and use of the bypass on high pressure gate \nvalves. A bypass on a gate valve is used to equalize the pressure on both side \nof discs so it may be easy to operate. Hydrantman's Duties in Regard to a High \nPressure Hydrants are as follows: First: unscrew two nuts which allows covers to \nbe taken off. Open cap on 3 1/2 inch outlet. Open the main valve in the same hole bored for \nthat purpose. Close main cover, open 3 inch outlet independent valve which releases \npressure. Then proceed to take off all caps and open all independent valves. Wipe all \nfittings with a piece of waste saturated with kerosene so as to free the same from all dust. \nOil all independent valves and bushing. Oil all outlets. Close independent valves, see that \nsame are not manned. Screw on caps on outlets. Be sure that main valve is seated. If main \nvalve should leak through gland, same should be taken up or repacked. After hydrant \nis put in good working condition, the number of same and also hydrant gate should be \nnoted. Hydrant gate should be inspected and same kept free from water. If the frame of \nsaid gate had sunk below the grade of street, it should be reported on daily report. The \nvaults of section gates in a hydrantman's district should be inspected. If by any reason \nwater or gas was found in same, it should be reported. If seepage should be noticed \ncoming through any of the highways same should be reported to Water Company or Supt. \nof System. Hydrantman's Rules Rule No. \n24 Section 1 Hydrant men shall attend to all hydrants and cisterns in \ntheir respective districts, see that the same are kept in good condition and ready at all times \nfor immediate use. Section 2. They shall see that hydrants are at all times kept free \nfrom obstructions of every character so that access thereto may be readily had by engine \ncompanies. Section 3. They shall visit and inspect the cisterns in their respective \ndistricts once each week. Keep the same filled with water and see they are in proper \ncondition and ready for immediate use at all times. They shall report the condition of the \ncisterns to the Battalion Chief of the district said cisterns are located. But of any reason \ncistern because useless the fact shall be immediately reported to the Battalion Chief and \nSupt. of High Pressure. Ordinances It shall be \nunlawful for any person to obstruct any hydrant on any public street or to place or deposit \nany lumber, rock, sand or other substance within fifteen feet of any hydrant on the \nroadway of any street. Any person who shall violate any of the provision of this ordinance \nshall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a \nfine not exceeding $500.00 or imprisonment for six months or both. It shall be \nunlawful for any person to use or interfere with any of valves, gates, hydrants or other \nparts of the Auxiliary High Pressure Water System unless authorized to do so by the \ndepartment controlling same. Any person violating this Ordinance shall be deemed guilty of \na misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof be subject to a find not exceeding $500 or by \nimprisonment in the County Jail for not more than 30 days or both.
