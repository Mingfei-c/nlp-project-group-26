Before buying a new car, you MUST get your credit report and credit score from Experian , Equifax or TrueCredit . Then auto dealers can't lie and say: \"You\nhave bad credit.\" Most people have black marks that need to be removed before applying for new car loans. Dealers should never know more about your credit than you. Which New Car Dealer Scams Did You Fall For? Most new car dealers are honest, but there are some who will scam you. Read our annual Top 10 New Car Dealer Scams . \"This new car is hot, everyone pays MSRP. We don't have to sell it cheaper.\" A common sales tactic in auto sales. If they have any in stock of your new\ncar or SUV, then it's not in demand or there would be 6 month waiting lists. If your new car is not \"in demand,\" then you should \"demand\" less than MSRP for your new\nvehicle. The Best Time for New Car Buying Many people ask when to buy new cars. Read our tips on the best time for buying new cars . When buying new cars, don't trade in a car you owe money on! I get complaints from people who traded in a used car they owed money on to buy a new car, and 2 months later were shocked to hear the new car dealer did not pay off\ntheir car loan in 10 days as promised. With this scam dealers pay you less for your trade than they promised. When the bank calls, YOU are responsible. The car\nloan is still in your name, until the dealer pays it off. When buying new cars, if you trade a used car in, make the dealer put in writing that he will pay off your\ncar loan in 10 days, or no deal. Then he is liable. Early Car Lease Termination Without Penalties? Taking Over a Short Term Lease? Shift your strategy away from terminating an auto lease early, trading your car and paying huge penalties. A better strategy is transferring your car lease to \nanother person via an auto lease trade. Sites like Swapalease.com and LeaseTrader.com can do a car lease swap for you, and reassign your auto lease to another buyer, saving\nyou thousands. You can also use them to take over a short term lease, where the previous owner already took the big depreciation hit.

I am a General Manager from a small \nfamily-owned car dealership located in Kansas, and everything you write (or rant) about is exactly what all of us need to hear (Customers and Dealers alike).

From: TIM [mailto:HODGDONS420@AOL.COM] DEAR JEFF, i AM A FINANCE MANAGER AT A VERY LARGE DEALERSHIP. i HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU. 1) DID YOU ASK YOUR BUTCHER TO SELL YOU YOUR STEAK AT HIS COST? 2) HOW MUCH DO YOU MAKE FROM SCARING PEOPLE OUT OF GOING TO THIER LOCAL DEALERSHIP? 3) WOULD YOU LIKE TO PUT THE SHOE ON THE OTHER FOOT AND TRY TO MAKE A LIVING IN A BUSINESS THAT PEOPLE LIKE YOU GIVE A BAD NAME AND MKE MORE MONEY THAN I DO FOR\nDOING IT. NOW JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS. YOU WOULDN'T LAST A DAY ON MY SALES FLOOR. IT HAS BEEN MY EXPERIENCE THAT ALL INTERNET SHOPPERS SHOP ON THE INTERNET BECAUSE THEY \nARE TO SCARED TO COME NEGOTIATE WITH THE BIG, BAD CAR SALESMAN.

HOW MUCH WATER DID YOU BUY LAST YEAR? PEOPLE LIKE YOU ARE THE ONES WHO \nGIVE THIS BUSINESS A BAD NAME. AND THATS WHAT IT IS, A BUSINESS. WE ARE HERE TO MAKE MONEY. DO YOU GET UPSET WHEN YOU GO TO A RESTARAUNT ANDPAY FIFTEEN DOLLARS \nFOR A STEAK THAT COST THEM THREE? PEOPLE LIKE YOU MAKE MY LIFE MISERABLE.
