The \r\n      health and safety of your pet(s) is a priority \r\n      with Baby Feathers, LLC. That is why we urge all owners to please \r\n      supervise your pet when introducing a new toy. We take pride in the care \r\n      and thought put into every toy and the supplies sold and/or promoted to \r\n      ensure they are as safe as possible. However, even the safest, simplest \r\n      toy can pose a threat. It is up to you, as their guardian, to use \r\n      discretion if a particular toy is right for your pet.  Please, keep \r\n      your pet healthy and safe in mind when introducing new items into their \r\n\t\tenvironment.  Remember to always consult with your \r\n      veterinarian professional before changing or adding to their diets or \r\n      environments. Baby \r\n\t\tFeathers, LLC is not responsible for any harm, or mishaps due to use of \r\n\t\tlighting, burning, melting or simmering of candles, incense or using \r\n\t\toils, melters or tarts. Please keep these safety tips in mind when using \r\n\t\tany candle, open flame or any scented product for that matter: Never \r\n\t\tleave a burning candle unattended! Please take special \r\n\t\t\tcare when using candles, melts, tarts or any scented products around \r\n\t\t\tchildren, pets and especially around birds \r\n\t\t\tand parrots . \r\n\t\t\tDo not place near flammable objects such as curtains, walls, etc. \r\n\t\t\tPlace only on a protected, heat resistant, level surface. Keep \r\n\t\t\tcandle free of wick trimmings, matches, or other foreign matter that \r\n\t\t\tcould be a fire hazard. Avoid burning in drafts. This will cause \r\n\t\t\tcandle to burn more quickly and unevenly. Please never walk around \r\n\t\t\twith lit candles. Please trim wicks to 1/4 inch at all times to \r\n\t\t\tavoid carbon build up on the wick. Some of the tart \r\n\t\t\tburners/melters, simmer pots, potpourri burners etc. on the market \r\n\t\t\tare not suitable for the intended use. Please take special care when \r\n\t\t\tusing these products. Never use any of these left untended nor \r\n\t\t\tuse around children and pets, especially birds and parrots! Make sure the tea light candle is a good distance from the underside \r\n\t\t\tof the burner where the wax is. If the wax gets too hot, the burner \r\n\t\t\tcan be come over heated and cause the aroma to burn away to fast and \r\n\t\t\tmay cause safety issues. It is our opinion that the tea light or \r\n\t\t\theat source should be no less than 2.5\" from the holder. When using \r\n\t\t\tscented oils you must always add water to the oil in the dish. Make \r\n\t\t\tsure you keep adding water as it will evaporate. If water is NOT \r\n\t\t\tadded, the dish may crack. Try to use wax melts/tart not the oils as \r\n\t\t\tyou should not have the worry over adding the extra water."
