      "text": "The Orthodox Christian should know the content of his religion as taught by the Church. He should be guided in studying what\n                        the Church has in its written (Bible) and unwritten (Sacred Tradition) teaching. The Orthodox Church is the only Church which\n                        has maintained from the beginning a coherent interpretation of its teaching. The Church approves of each member reading alone\n                        and in general talking about his religion. But it discourages conclusions based on the individual's personal interpretation. \" So Philip ran to him (the Ethiopian), and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet, and asked, 'Do you understand what you are\n                           reading?' And he said, 'How can Iunless some one guides me?\" ', Acts 8:28f. This \"guide\" is the Church itself, and not the individual on his own, with limited ability and lack of the full knowledge\n                        of the sources of the teachings of the Church. There are and have been many personalities in the Church who have devoted their lives to studying the Bible and keeping and\n                        preserving Sacred Tradition. But none became a leader of a new church outside of the One Undivided Church. Therefore, the\n                        Orthodox Church is the only one which preserves intact the \"Paradosis\", the written and unwritten Tradition. The Church,does\n                        not prevent the individual from exploring the deep meaning of the Bible to find new expressions. But this always must be authorized\n                        by the Church as a whole, where infallibility lies. It is important to know how freedom and authority work hand in hand in\n                        the teaching and governing of the Church. To achieve this understanding, the Orthodox Christian should know the basic sources\n                        of information. Each member of the Church, clergyman and layman, has the right and duty to protect the Orthodox faith from misinterpretation\n                        and false statements. But this cannot be done without knowing what is the correct teaching of the Church. The Bible is the\n                        unmovable cornerstone which through the centuries has guided the Christian in learning the Will of God. The Fathers of the\n                        Church, teachers and prophets, are the instruments by which the Will of God is transmitted to the members of the Church so\n                        that they might follow the steps Which Jesus Christ revealed. How important is the influence of the Church in guiding its\n                        people? The answer is in the more than 200 Christian denominations possessing the same Bible, yet who insist that their particular\n                        interpretation alone teaches the truth of the Bible. Thus they are divided. Most of them assert that the Bible can be self-taught\n                        and requires no outside interpretation while they all claim the same thing, they still are divided. The Church - from catacombs to cathedrals, from plain teaching to dogma and doctrine, from simple directions to formal administration-follows\n                        the steps which have been revealed to it by Almighty God in a coherent continuation of its external and internal teaching\n                        of the faith. There are two specific distinctions within the Orthodox Church. One is the relationship between \"freedom and\n                        authority, in the, government of the Church. The other is the system of self-governing churches. These distinctions are not\n                        very well known among the other Christian churches. The highest authority in the Orthodox Church is the \"Conscience of the\n                        Church\", which is the consent of the people of the Orthodox Church on the explanation of the faith given at times of its disputes.\n                        The general assemblies (synods) of the self-governing national Orthodox churches, made up of clergy, especially bishops, meet\n                        to decide, by unanimous opinion, matters of faith in dispute. The self-governing national churches have the same teachings,\n                        canons and liturgical worship, and, in fact, constitute One Church. The Orthodox Christian should know and understand these facts in order to participate fully in the activities of the Church\n                        and to defend his position with authoritative explanations in times of discussion among friends of other churches. It is imperative\n                        for the Orthodox Christian to know the sources of the teachings especially when he must counteract the propaganda of those\n                        who would proselytize members of the Orthodox Church. This happened in the early Church and in the 17th century, and happens\n                        today. In the early Church, when the dogmas and teachings of the Church were not formally developed, there were many members\n                        of the church who turned to heretics, gnostics and other groups. Also, from the fourth century on, there appeared laymen,\n                        clergymen, even bishops and patriarchs who taught falsely the Christian faith. In the ninth century when the Great Schism\n                        began to develop between the Eastern and Western parts of the Church, and especially from the 16th century on, with the rise\n                        of Protestantism, these mistaken interpretations became more explicit. Against all these factors, the Orthodox Church has\n                        fought to keep itself intact to defend the truths which had been taught it by its Founder, Jesus Christ and His Apostles,\n                        in whom the roots of the Church are to be found. These circumstances demanded that the Church defend its teachings and set forth the sources with accurate interpretations\n                        over the centuries. It is worth stressing that the development of these sources was to counteract the false opinions of Christians\n                        themselves; opinions not based on the correct interpretation of the Church itself. These sources of the accurate teachings\n                        of the Church are herein enumerated in order to counteract false opinions based on individual misinterpretations."

      "text": "What are the sources of the One Undivided Church, the Orthodox Church, from which emerge its teachings? Why is it imperative\n                        for the members of the Church to know these sources? The mainsources of Orthodox teaching are the Bible and Sacred Tradition.\n                        The third source is the writings of the so-called Apostolic Fathers and the Apologists. The fourth source is decisions of\n                        the canonical synods, local and ecumenical, and their utterances of faith, especially the Symbol of Faith (Nicene Creed) and\n                        some of their canons pertaining to faith. The fifth source is the discourses written at the time of disputes and schisms,\n                        especially the Great Schism between the Eastern and Western parts of the Undivided Church (1054). The sixth source is a variety\n                        of discourses written after the Protestant Reformation; these documents critique the various errors of Protestantism and Roman\n                        Catholicism. The Holy Bible was not written as a systematic book containing the expressions of faith in symbols or confessions. There are\n                        many passages which convey the beliefs in Christ, or in Christ and the Holy Spirit, and or in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n                        These verses, which were used as confessions and symbols of belief, are expressed in few words. Such passages are to be found\n                        in the New Testament, as in Matthew, where the Risen Christ commissioned the Apostles: \" Go, therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them inthe name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit \" (28: 19-20). The Apostles admonished the people to believe in Jesus Christ as Savior. It was necessary for the early Church to preserve\n                        these phrases mainly for,use as a symbol and confession of faith in the pronouncement of candidates for baptism. Such confessions\n                        are found in Romans 1:3-4, 1 Corinthians 15:3-8, Philippians 2:5-11 and 1 Timothy 3:16: \"Great indeed we confess, is the mystery of our religion: He (Christ) was manifested in the flesh, vindicated in the spirit,\n                           seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory\". Later, when Christianity started to grow and become more organized, the bishops wrote confessions and symbols of faith based\n                        on the teachings of the Apostles, becoming sources in themselves. Such confessions are found in the writings of Bishop Ignatius\n                        (c.35-c.107), Justin the Martyr (c.100-c.165) in his Apology, Bishop Irenaeus (c.130-c.200) and Origen (c.185-c.254) and especially\n                        in the Apostolic Symbol. The Apostolic Symbol used in baptism was once considered to have been written by the 12 Apostles,\n                        with each Apostle having written one article. This Symbol was falsely attributed to them. They did not write it. This Symbol,\n                        however, was used by the entire Church, for it was acknowledged as one of the three ecumenical symbols of faith, having more\n                        use in the Western part of the Church."

      "text": "The next source, which came into being out of necessity over disputes in the fourth century, was the confession of faith,\n                        still known as the fundamental source and highest pronouncement of the faith of Church. It was formulated by the First Ecumenical\n                        Synod in Nicaea in 325 (articles 1-7) and by the Second Ecumenical Synod in Constantinople in 381 (articles 8-12). This Symbol\n                        not only is named after the city in which it was written, but also is known by the number of bishops present at the synod\n                        in Nicaea, being referred to as the \"Symbol of Faith of the 318 Fathers\". The synod in Nicaea convened in 325, to resolve\n                        the dispute caused by Arius, a presbyter, who denied the divinity of Christ as the Second Person of the Holy Trinity and that\n                        there was a time when He did not exist The 318 Fathers formulated the correct teaching in the first seven articles of the\n                        Nicene Creed. Despite the correct pronouncement of this synod, Arianism continued and became a splintered Christian sect,\n                        with the bishops who failed to accept the correct teaching of Christ's nature being excommunicated. In 381, another synod\n                        had to be convened to stop the incorrect teaching of Macedonius, who used Arian reasoning to question the divinity of the\n                        Holy Spirit, claiming He was created by the Son. The bishops at the Synod in Constantinople formulated the correct teaching\n                        concerning the Holy Spirit, that He was not created, but proceeds from the Father and is sent by the Son. This formulated\n                        truth became the last part of the Nicene Creed (last five articles). Hence the phrase, \"One God in three Hypostases (persons)\",\n                        prevails. This Confession, the Nicene Creed, has become the main source of the teachings of the Christian Church since the\n                        First and Second Synods."

This Creed is a source\n                        because it states the orthodox teaching of the faith of the Church. This Creed was not written by Athanasius, but attributed\n                        to him, and is believed by some to have been written by St. Ambrose in Latin.

He brought order to the Church and increased its missionary work, especially in\n                        Bulgaria. What became another major source of the teachings of the Church is the encyclical epistle of Photius sent to the\n                        Patriarchs of the East, with the consent of the Synod of Constantinople, protesting against the innovations of Pope Nicholas\n                        Iof Rome: his interference in the affairs of the newly-converted nation of Bulgaria, the addition of the filioque phrase\n                        in the Nicene Creed, the issuing of the Pseudo-Isidorian Decrees and the Pseudo-Constantian Gift.

At that time, Pope Leo IX interfered in the jurisdiction of Constantinople in South\n                        Italy, where the Pope had introduced innovations, as had his predecessor in Bulgaria. The Pope sent to Patriarch Michael and\n                        to Bishop John of Tranis of Apoulia insulting letters in which he claimed his primacy over the entire Church, East and West,\n                        and that the Pope was infallible and had authority over both political and ecclesiastical jurisdictions. The Pseudo-Constantine\n                        Gift was used as a basis for the Pope's claim. In addition, Pope Leo sent an emissary, Cardinal Humbert, a bad-mannered, arrogant man, to Constantinople. He insulted the\n                        Patriarch on July 16, 1054, by entering St. Sophia Cathedral during the Divine Liturgy, halting the services, and reading\n                        aloud and then placing on the altar a libel, a Bull of Excommunication of the Patriarch and his followers. This act of Pope\n                        Leo IX finalized the schism between West and East which had begun in 866. The Patriarch summoned a synod of many bishops on\n                        July 20, 1054.. They, in turn, excommunicated the libel, the Bull, and all who supported it but purposely did not mention\n                        the name of Pope Leo in order to leave open the opportunity of reconciliation. Ironically, Pope Leo IX had died on April 13,\n                        1054, three months before Cardinal Humbert reached Constantinople. Before Cardinal Humbert came to Constantinople, Patriarch Michael had already sent to Patriarch Peter of Antioch the two epistles\n                        in which he enumerates in detail all the innovations of the Pope, consulting the encyclical of Patriarch Photius (866) for\n                        reference. Three of the 12 innovations listed are: the use of unleavened bread by the Western Church for the Liturgy, baptism\n                        by only one emersion (instead of three) and the filioque phrase in the Creed. The two epistles are considered sources of the\n                        teachings of the Orthodox Church because they point out the innovations of the Western part of the Church made outside the\n                        ecumenical synod, thus without ratification by the entire Church body. These epistles took on special prominence because they\n                        were written just shortly before the Schism."

Athos by 14th century monks. The controversy arose over the issue of the substance of God and\n                        the energy of God. Hesychasm means the spiritual tendency of the orthodox monks toward a clear theory of quietness leading\n                        to mystic union with God in prayer through Divine Grace. St. Gregory of Palamas taught the difference between the correct\n                        teaching of Hesychasm and the Latin theory. This dispute caused the summoning of three synods (1341, 1347, 1351), which issued\n                        three Tomes stating the correct meaning and interpretation of Hesychasm in a dogma, thereby becoming a source on this orthodox\n                        teaching."

Agroup of German theologians at the University of Tubingen, under the leadership of Jacob Andreae\n                        and Martin Crusius, sent Stephen Gerlack to Constantinople to present to Patriarch Jeremiah II on May 24, 1575, three letters\n                        and the Augsburg Confession translated in Greek. Their goal was to explore possible unity of the new movement with the Ancient\n                        Orthodox Church. The Patriarch sent the first of three lengthy answers to the theologians on May 15, 1576, through the German\n                        embassy. The theologians then sent a detailed reply to the Patriarch. In all, the correspondence on the Augsburg Confession\n                        resulted in three answers and three replies. The death of the principles on both sides ended this effort. The three Answers\n                        of Patriarch Jeremiah II of Constantinople are important sources that restate the accurate teachings of the Orthodox Church.\n                        Jeremiah's correspondence was the first contact of the Orthodox Church with the new Protestant movement."

      "text": "The Symbol of Nicaea-Constantinopolitan (Nicene Creed) and the dogmatical utterances of the Ecumenical Synods are the primary\n                        and distinctive sources of the faith of the Orthodox Church. They have been ratified by the Synods and are unchangeable in\n                        form and substance. The other sources, which are the decisions of synods which took place after the eighth century, are of\n                        secondary significance, but very important for the historical evolution of the teaching of the Orthodox Church, especially\n                        the teaching against the innovations of the Catholic Church, which was separated in 1054 from the Orthodox Church, and with\n                        reference to Protestant Churches dating from the 16th century. These are secondary sources, pending ratification by an Ecumenical\n                        Synod, and may be accepted, corrected or not accepted. The utterances (primary sources) of the Orthodox Church are mainly\n                        part of the Sacred Tradition of the Church, which is of the same validity as Scripture. The decisions of the Seven Ecumenical Synods include the Regional Synods, Saint-Apostles and some Fathers which have been\n                        ratified by the Ecumenical Synods, especially the Sixth in its Canon 102. So the faithful member of the Orthodox Church should\n                        thoroughly study the primary sources, then read the secondary sources herein listed. The distinction between the primary and\n                        secondary sources is important, because the primary 'sources were found in the life and teachings of the One Undivided Church\n                        of the first thousand-years of Christianity and were adopted and kept as such through the centuries, excepting innovations\n                        such as the filioque phrase in the Nicene Creed. Because Sacred Tradition is of equal validity as the Bible, the identification of sources is essential since Tradition is\n                        rooted in these sources, written and preserved by the Church itself. This is important, because the Church makes the decisions\n                        and interprets the Bible, eliminating possible individual misinterpretations. \"First of all you must understand this, that no prophecy of scripture is a matter ofone's own interpretation, because no prophecy\n                           ever came by theimpulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.\" (2 Peter 1:20-21) Because the Church has not written and officially adopted a catechism in which the infallible teaching of the Church is definitely\n                        expressed, the theologian has the \"freedom with authority\", to express anew the same unchangeable Truths of Christ. Christianity\n                        (or Christendom) has been separated into many parts because individuals through the centuries have taken it upon themselves\n                        to interpret the Bible personally. They have used limited knowledge and were unaware of the basic sources, and have consequently\n                        arrived at false interpretations, each claiming to be led by the Holy Spirit. Thus, the Holy Spirit is made to seem a dividing\n                        force for each, rather than leading and being the guardian of the One Undivided Church of Christ as revealed in Scripture.\n                        Apostle Peter warns against personal interpretation of Scripture by saying that: \" Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, speaking of this ashe does in all his letters. There are some things\n                           in them hard tounderstand, which the unlearned and unstable twist to their owndestruction, as they do the other scriptures\n                           ... knowing this beforehand, beware lest you be carried away with the error of man and lose your own stability. \" (2 Peter 3:15-17) The Orthodox Christian is blessed to be part of the One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church which has been preserved intact,\n                        by mercy, the fullness of the Christian Faith.  In Holy Orthodoxy, the interpretation of Scripture and the teachings of the\n                        Church have the unanimous ratification of the Church, with its infallible authority. It is this interpretation of the teachings\n                        of Christ by the infallible Church that must be first known and understood by the Orthodox Christian who is admonished by\n                        Apostle Peter: \" Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that is in you, yet do it with gentleness\n                           and reverence.\" (1 Peter 3:15) Copyright: © 2004 Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America Editor: Fr.
