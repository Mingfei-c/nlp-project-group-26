Our lawyers and field officers work in remote areas, far from\n    the nearest law libraries. We are using the Internet to take the law libraries to our\n    lawyers and field officers, and to take information to our\n    clients. This pilot project has not required any additional funding. ALRM\nCLIENT SERVICES THE ROLE OF THE LEGAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT Information about ALRM and its services. WHAT\nTO DO IF YOU ARE ARRESTED Information for ALRM\nclients.. OFFICES Where to find us. THE ROLE OF\nTHE ABORIGINAL LEGAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT The Aboriginal Legal Rights\n    Movement Inc (ALRM) exists to get social justice for\n    Aboriginal people and their communities. The Movement began\n    in 1971 and was incorporated in 1973. ALRM is a non-profit\n    organisation. We provide a legal service to Aboriginal people\n    and their communities. ALRM works to keep law and\n    justice systems honest. We demand recognition of our\n    cultures. We fight for economic and social status for our\n    dispossessed people. Our role has expanded to\n    include changing laws where needed, to improve social justice\n    and further the fight for equal rights. Conflict\n    Policy For many years now, ALRM has\n    had a policy of not allowing its lawyers to act in cases of\n    conflict between Aboriginal people. Both parties can still approach us for help, but we'll have\n    to assess your cases to see if we need to arrange alternative\n    representation. Field\n    Officers On the phone or in person,\n    you should ask to speak to a Field Officer. They will listen\n    to your questions, get some details about your situation, and\n    find ways for you to get the answers, information and help\n    you need. ALRM has a 24-hour answering\n    service. You can get hold of a Field Officer during day-time\n    office hours and, in the case of emergencies, at night. If\n    you're ever picked up by the police, call us for help right\n    away - before answering any questions. Criminal\n    Section ALRM lawyers cover most\n    Courts in South Australia. The lawyers give legal\n    advice, represent you through all Court proceedings, help to\n    prepare documents and assist with appeals. Call us as soon as possible if you want a lawyer\n    with you in Court. The lawyers need you to tell\n    them what you want, so they can handle your case the best\n    way. Civil\n    Section This Section of ALRM works to\n    get justice for you in non-criminal matters. We help you to\n    get and use your own power through action and education. This Section handles equal\n    opportunity, family issues and separations, workers' and\n    other compensation, police complaints, and community and\n    corporate issues. Equal\n    opportunity If you think you've been\n    discriminated against, we can help. We'll be there to support\n    you if you want to make a complaint to the Equal Opportunity\n    Commission. You can make the complaint yourself. Our Field\n    Officers and lawyers will assist you at any stage. Family law Many of you speak to us about\n    custody, access and maintenance of your children. We prepare\n    Court documents, appear in Court with you and help you to\n    reach a good solution. ALRM knows that going to Court about\n    the family is stressful. We'll work to help you find a better\n    way to deal with the problem. Workers\n    compensation Sometimes, when people are\n    hurt at work, their claims are not accepted. If you need to,\n    you can dispute your employer's or the insurer's decisions.\n    ALRM can help you to get those decisions reviewed to get a\n    fair result. Police\n    complaints If you've been treated badly\n    by the police, come to us. Your Field Officer will help you to lodge a Police Complaint\n    statement. The complaint goes to the\n    Police Complaints Authority (PCA). The PCA is independent of\n    the police and can investigate your complaint. ALRM will help\n    you to make the statement, explain to you about the rest of\n    the process and tell you what's happening as it goes along. Family\n    separations ALRM works with the\n    Aboriginal Child Care Agency to write and give information to\n    the National Enquiry by the Human Rights and Equal\n    Opportunity Commission into the Separation of Indigenous\n    Families. If you've got any questions, call us. Compensation If you have suffered injury\n    because of the actions of another person or organisation, you\n    may be able to claim compensation. We can talk to you about\n    this and help you go further. Community\n    and corporate issues The ALRM Civil Section\n    includes a Corporate Solicitor who can provide information,\n    legal assistance and representation for community\n    organisations and family groups. If your group needs to be incorporated under Federal or State\n    laws for funding purposes, we can help. In consultation with\n    your group members, we can give you legal assistance to draft\n    your constitution. We also can provide advice on meeting\n    procedures, elections or other issues arising within\n    Aboriginal community organisations. Copyright,\n    Property, or Business matters If you need information,\n    ALRM's Civil Section will help you find the information you\n    need. The\n    Aboriginal Justice Advocacy Committee (AJAC). ALRM and the South Australian\n    State Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DOSAA) formed AJAC in\n    June 1994. The Committee is funded by the Aboriginal and\n    Torres Strait Islanders Commission (ATSIC) through DOSAA. AJAC monitors how the State\n    Government meets the recommendations of the Royal Commission\n    into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. We make sure that\n    Aboriginal people are involved in getting those\n    recommendations to work. We keep you informed about what's happening. The Committee meets every\n    month. We want the opinions and\n    concerns of Aboriginal people about the Royal Commission, and\n    how its recommendations are being put into practice. Contact\n    your local AJAC representatives about what you think your\n    Committee should be looking at and working on. Aboriginal\n    Visitors Scheme The Scheme works across South\n    Australia, and means that you don't have to be alone in the\n    police cells if you are detained. ALRM pays for the time and\n    travel of volunteer Aboriginal visitors who come to you to\n    provide support. The police must contact\n    the AVS every time they keep an Aboriginal person in a police\n    cell. ALRM has visitors in\n    Adelaide, Berri, Ceduna, Coober Pedy, Mount Gambier, Murray\n    Bridge, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, Port Pirie and Whyalla. Visitors make sure you're not\n    alone and that you're being treated properly. They look after your rights, get you medical help if you need\n    it, and contact your family if you want. If you haven't been treated\n    properly, the visitor can make a report on that, so that you\n    can lodge a Police Complaint. Anti-Poverty\n    Unit This Unit used to be your\n    Financial Counselling Service. Now, we're doing more community education and fewer\n    individual cases. ALRM is working to give\n    Aboriginal people training on money matters. We'll be setting up self-help groups in communities, and they\n    will start up networks to give advice to others. You'll be\n    able to make good financial decisions with good information. The Native\n    Title Unit (NTU) The NTU is based in Adelaide. We make claims for Native Title or compensation. We help sort out disagreements between people making claims. We represent you in any matter connected with the Native\n    Title Act. The NTU is responsible for\n    all land claims outside the Anangu Pitjatjantjara and\n    Maralinga Tjarutja lands. If you think you're entitled to\n    claim under the Native Title Act, write to us with the names\n    of who's claiming, the area being claimed and who'll benefit\n    from it.
