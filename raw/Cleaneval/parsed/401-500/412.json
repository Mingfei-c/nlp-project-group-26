It enabled many to move to suburbia , buy homes, and raise kids who would grow up to demonize unions."

If Aand Bare language s (not necessarily regular language s) then the union of Aand B (usually written A ∪ B ) is defined as follows. { x | x ∈ Aor x ∈ B } In plain English : A ∪ Bis the set of all string s which are either member s of Aor Bor both. For example, if A = {a,b,c}, and B = {c,d,e} A ∪ B = {a,b,c,d,e} Some interesting things to note about the union operation: The union of a set with any subset is equal to the original set ( iff B ⊆ A , then A ∪ B = A ). Regular languages are closed under the union operation. This means that if Aand Bare regular languages, then so is A ∪ B ."

Third, the columns must have the same constraints with regard to null values.  Either both columns must allow nulls or forbid nulls.  Again, some products are less strict than the standard .

Remember, the columns must be of the same type and size, but there is no requirement that their data be in any way related.  You really can mix apples and oranges with a UNION query. One important \" gotcha \" with UNION is that by default it eliminates duplicate rows in each SELECT statement (see DISTINCT ).  To ensure each row gets returned, UNION ALL must be used."
