      "text": "Allowed access to national gatherings of U.S. radical right groups including the Ku Klux Klan and the Posse Comitatus, BLOOD IN THE FACE straightforwardly presents the views of people whose avowed goal is to forge a political union which will transform North America into one Aryan nation. Blatantly and without flinching, members of these groups describe their agenda of anti-semitism, racism, and extreme nationalism. Their heroes are Adolf Hitler and George Lincoln Rockwell, founder of the American Nazi Party. Wedding ceremonies are performed at burning crosses. Their message is spread through their own home video network. BLOOD IN THE FACE, whose title refers to the belief that only white people can blush, is a searing record of America's radical right, a social and political force which can no longer be dismissed. \"The riveting documentary... is neither as uproarious as ROGER AND ME nor as jazzy as THE ATOMIC CAFE, but it is far more insidiously spooky in its picture of the extreme right. BLOOD IN THE FACE is first-rate journalism.\" - Vincent Canby, New York Times \"**** [4 Stars - Highly Recommended] The terror of this program is in the quiet, deadly rationalizations of its fanatical subjects. It is an excellent introduction to the racist, far-right political elements in America and Canada.\" - Video Rating Guide for Libraries 75 minutes\n\t\t\t\t\t\n / color\n\n / 1990 Sale/video: $175 Rental/video: $125 Subject areas : African-Americans , Civil Rights , North America, Philosophy , Psychology , Racism , Sociology Related Titles: Brotherhood of Hate : An investigation of a seemingly isolated murder in rural Arkansas, revealing the virulent, dangerous mentality of white supremacy in America, handed down from one generation to the next. South : The heart of this journey is the brutal murder of James Byrd, Jr in Jasper, Texas.  But this is not an anatomy of his murder, rather, it is an evocation of how this event fits in to a landscape and climate as much mental as physical."
