As an introductory remark we\r\nmight say that in science fiction there are various notions about what\r\ntime travel is or could be.  One species of time travel, for instance,\r\ninvolves the idea that there are many universes, a manifold of\r\nuniverses, in fact, capable of containing branching time lines and\r\nalternative histories.  The conception of time travel in time\r\ntraveler's chess is different from the \"many universe\" conception and\r\ndifferent from a large number of other interesting conceptions."

      "text": "In time traveler's chess, there is only one world, and time travel is\r\nalways continuous.  If a chessman begins\r\nto move backwards in time at move 30 and travels all the way back to\r\nmove 20, then the time traveling chessman will be on the board,\r\nmoving backwards in time, at move 29, at move 28, at move 27, and so\r\nforth.  There will be at least two versions of the chessman on the\r\nboard from move 20 to move 29, since in the \"personal history\" of this\r\nchessman, the chessman first moved forward in time to get to move 30\r\nand then began to move backwards in time.  So there will be a forward\r\nmoving version and a backwards moving version.  To make matters even\r\nmore confusing, at move 20 in our example, when the time traveling\r\nchessman begins to move forward again in time, a second forward\r\nmoving version of the chessman appears on the board.  Then, so long\r\nas this second forward moving version survives there will actually be\r\nthree versions of the chessman on the board through move 29! Atime traveler's chess set, then, has three varieties of chessmen.\r\n  In the starting position - the same starting position as\r\nfor standard chess - all chessmen are \"untraveled\" in time.  For\r\neach of these chessmen there should be on hand,\r\nin case need arises, a corresponding \"traveling\" chessman.  When\r\na traveling chessman appears on the board, that chessman\r\nshould be understood to be currently traveling backwards in time.\r\n  (If we could be such a chessman, stationed in a safe spot\r\non the\r\nchessboard, we would see astounding sights.  We would see pawns move\r\nbackwards.  We would see chessmen occasionally spring into\r\nexistence on squares being vacated by other chessmen.  Gazing\r\nbeyond the perimeters of the board, we could observe chess clocks\r\nrunning backwards, pens leaping into players' hands, doughnuts\r\nmiraculously forming whole,\r\nunbite by unbite, from the mouths of humans.)  For each\r\ntraveling chessman\r\nthere must be be a \"traveled\" chessman.  Traveled\r\nchessmen are grizzled veterans; they have moved backwards in time\r\nand are again moving forward in time. The three versions - untraveled, traveling, traveled - are three\r\nstages in a personal history.  Each such personal history is folded\r\nback through time in such a way that all three stages play out\r\nsimultaneously on the board. Atime traveler's chess set can easily be fabricated from three\r\nstandard sets and some modeler's paint.  Untraveled chessmen might look pristine, traveling chessmen strange,\r\ntraveled chessmen experienced."

      "text": "Again, in time traveler's chess there are three versions of each chessman: the untraveled version, the traveling version,\r\n and the traveled version.\r\n  In the initial setup - identical to the initial setup for standard chess - all chessmen are untraveled.  Untraveled \r\nchessmen move exactly like chessmen in standard chess, except in the case of \"annihilation\", explained below. Traveling chessmen are the Cageian musicians of chess, sitting quietly for the entire duration of their incarnations. \r\n They appear in \"explosions\" and disappear either in annihilations or by capture, the latter case ending the game in defeat\r\n for their armies. Each traveled chessman appears on the chessboard simultaneously with a traveling chessman of the same piece type,\r\n in an explosion.  In the very first move of a traveled chessman's appearance, the move that is part of an explosion, \r\nthe traveled chessman has a restriction upon his ability to capture, but for every move thereafter\r\n the traveled chessman moves exactly like a chessman of standard chess. There are three types of moves: the explosion, the normal move, and the annihilation.  The player to move makes one move of \r\none of these types.  Aplayer's move only directly affects chessmen of the player's assigned color except when the move is a normal \r\nmove that captures an enemy piece or an explosion that captures an enemy piece."

      "text": "An explosion requires an \"explosion square\".  \r\nAn explosion square is an empty square reachable \r\nin no more than three moves by a friendly untraveled chessman of the piece-type of interest. \r\n Such an untraveled piece is called\r\nan \"explosion support\", and there is an additional requirement that after each explosion a player causes, there must be at\r\nleast one way to pair past explosions with associated explosion supports such that no two explosions are paired with the same\r\nexplosion support.  For instance, if the player to move\r\n wishes to cause a \"rook explosion\" at a given square, the given square must be empty and the player must have at least\r\n one untraveled rook (or pawn that could promote to rook) on the board which, in the hypothetical circumstance that \r\nthe player were allowed to make moves in succession, could reach the given square, as untraveled rook, in no more than \r\nthree total moves.  (These hypothetical moves could include captures of enemy chessmen. Some of the moves also could be of \r\nfriendly chessmen other than the rook, in order to free lines for the rook.)  Further,\r\n at least one of these explosion supports must\r\nnot have been required to justify an earlier explosion. There is one final requirement for a square to serve as an explosion square.  This requirement\r\n introduces the term \"resonator\".  Aresonator is any untraveled chessman which could \r\npossibly annihilate with an existing traveling chessman.  (See the discussion of annihilation below.)  The requirement is that a traveled chessman of the piece-type\r\nof interest can move from the explosion square without capturing an enemy traveling chessman or a resonator. The player to move causes an explosion by placing traveling and traveled chessmen of the same\r\n piece-type on a qualified explosion square and then making a legal move with the traveled chessman\r\n without capturing a traveling chessman or a resonator. \r\n When the explosion has been accomplished two new, friendly\r\n chessmen are on the board.  Atraveling chessman has appeared on the \r\nexplosion square.  Atraveled chessman of the same piece-type has appeared one legal move from the explosion square.  The \r\ntraveled chessman may or may not have captured an enemy chessman but certainly has not captured either a traveling\r\n chessman or a\r\n resonator.  For the new traveling chessman there will be at least one friendly resonator of the same piece type no more than \r\nthree moves distant."

An advanced untraveled pawn can be the explosion support of a traveling chessman of piece-type other than pawn by virtue \r\nof promotion. An untraveled pawn promotes to an untraveled piece.  Atraveled pawn promotes to a traveled piece.

The game is over, but let's now contemplate what has happened from the noumenal point of view.  To facilitate this contemplation, let's pretend that White has made that forbidden final, fifth move and has thus reified the royal murder.  What has happened?  Okay, the WKB sat on his original square until move three.  On move three he sprang to the square d3, capturing a pawn.  On move four he captured a queen on c4.  On move five he leapt to b5 and immediately began to time travel.  He time traveled (in place, of course, since traveling pieces do not move) back to move four, then to move three, then to move two.
