More generally, it is an attempt to offer a rationale\r\nfor the legitimate role of conscience and free thought within the Living\r\nApostolic Tradition. As in much of my writing, this is an exercise in navigating\r\nbetween the twin perils of Conservatism and Liberalism . The Conservative,\r\nexemplified by Sr Waddelove, would have us believe that the only role of\r\nconscience is to be conformed to the Official Teaching of the Church. The\r\nLiberal would have the Official Teaching of the Church restricted to a\r\nstatement along the lines \"anything that you find congenial is true for\r\nyou\"."

Clamour for \"rights of free speech\" and \" freedom\r\nof religion \" should be denied. Dissidents should be ghettoized, deported, imprisoned or executed. An \"opportunity for repentance\" should be given before execution, but the choice is always between recantation and death. Regrettably, it may be the lesser of two evils for a Catholic State to\r\noffer limited toleration to those aiming\r\nto propagate wrong ideas, if on balance it seems that to be properly proscriptive would do more ancillary harm than it could be expected to prevent."

      "text": "Since the promulgation of the recent Vatican Synod's Declaration on Religious\r\nLiberty \"Dignitatis Humanae\", the Official Teaching has changed dramatically.\r\nIt might now be characterized as follows: It is an important part of the mission of the Magisterium of the Church\r\nto identify and warn against wrong ideas. However, Freedom of religion is an inalienable human right [DH #2]. Civil authorities should therefore facilitate their citizens or subjects\r\nin the practice of any religion that does not immediately threaten civil\r\nupheaval [DH #3]. Those who hold wrong ideas in good faith should be allowed to freely propagate\r\nthem, as long as there is no threat to public order [DH #3]. Those who hold wrong ideas in bad faith should be opposed. Bad faith is always indicated when the Magisterium is directly challenged,\r\nbut never otherwise, hence: Those holding divergent beliefs who make no pretence to membership of the\r\nRoman Jurisdiction can safely be deemed to be in good faith and are to\r\nbe respected. Respectful dialogue , social interaction\r\nand common worship should be encouraged, at all levels, with those who\r\nhold seriously erroneous beliefs: as long as they do not pretend membership\r\nof the Roman Jurisdiction and so directly challenge its authority. The\r\nphotograph shows Pope John Paul II kissing a copy of the Koran. Those who claim membership of the Roman Jurisdiction while resisting the\r\njudgement of its Magisterium are manifestly in bad faith and should be\r\nexcommunicated. No dialogue should be countenanced with dissidents who claim membership of the Roman Jurisdiction. In particular, adherents of the Old Liturgy are to be particularly singled out, because their insistence that the \"reforms\"\r\nwere misguided hits at the foundations of the modern Church establishment,\r\nsettlement and consensus. Whereas it is the duty of the civil authority to defend its citizens and/or\r\nsubjects from harm: Freedom of  speech is an inalienable human right. Dissidents should be opposed at most by argument and propaganda. It is generally appropriate to tolerate the full expression of erroneous\r\nbeliefs, as most are less damaging to society than the civil disorder that\r\nwould result from any attempt to suppress them. An exception is to be made in the case of homosexuality : this is such a grave social evil as\r\nto merit special measures there is unlikely to be a significant adverse violent reaction, as homosexuals\r\nare still a generally feared and hated minority."

They\r\ncannot justly claim that others who oppose them, even by imposing constraints\r\non them, do an injustice either towards them or towards the general population\r\nwhom they wish to address. This principle is to be accepted not so much\r\nbecause it is the consistent teaching of the Ordinary Magisterium, though\r\nit is (as Mr Davies establishes in his pamphlet) but more because its negation\r\nis absurd. The traditional teaching does however have one huge deficiency, the\r\nremedy of which does much to defuse the objections of a modern audience.\r\nThis\r\ndefect is simple. Inadequate allowance is made for the intellectual space\r\nthat is required for faith to grow. The traditional teaching views the\r\nhierarchy of the Church as ultimately wise and knowledgeable, and the Magisterium\r\ncertain and infallible on all matters. Similarly, it views the laity as ignorant. Hence, it asserts that they should be docile and entirely passive in receiving the teaching, admonitions and judgement\r\nof the Magisterium. The business of the laity is to do and believe what\r\nit is told. There is no need or place for question or debate  The\r\nlaity have no competence to do either. If something cannot be understood\r\nor seems to be wrong, it must nevertheless be accepted without hesitation\r\nas right: just on the basis of authority. Whatever comprehension is appropriate\r\nshould later be sought over time in prayer. Anyone with good will can be\r\nexpected to recognize the truth of the Magisterium's decrees more or less\r\nimmediately. Now in fact, all this is far from the case. For those who are not Catholics,\r\nthe Magisterium has no particular credibility and commands little respect.\r\nThis is first because there is no reason why the opposite should be the\r\ncase, and second because the Magisterium has manifestly been mistaken on a\r\nnumber of significant matters and has generally not had the grace to\r\nface up to this. Hence it is not reasonable that non-Catholics should be\r\nexpected to respond positively and enthusiastically to the Magisterium.\r\nThey will rather require persuasion! As far as Catholics are concerned, it is wrong for the hierarchy to\r\ndismiss the laity as ignorant and incompetent. In as far as this is true,\r\nit is undesirable ,\r\nand largely the fault of the hierarchy for failing to educate them. It\r\nis unreasonable to ask for blind faith, when Catholicism prides itself\r\non having a high doctrine of human reason and its relationship with faith. Honesty is a prime virtue and requires\r\nthat doubts and difficulties are faced and addressed openly, though with\r\nan attitude of faith not cynical scepticism. Only by recognizing and making\r\nexplicit our doubts can we come, with the\r\nBlessed Apostle Thomas, to the conviction of a mature faith based on an\r\nencounter with Our Risen Lord."

The fact that the teaching of the Vatican Synod is novel and apparently\r\ncontrary both to the overwhelming consensus of the Fathers and recent\r\npapal teaching does not necessarily make it wrong. The previous teaching\r\nwas never defined . In any case,\r\nthe change is mainly one of implementation and this might be justified\r\nby a change in circumstance.

For some reason, while Islam; Buddhism;\r\nVoodoo and Scientology are to be tolerated, because they are religions,\r\nand their adherents accorded full civil rights - including the rights to\r\nindoctrinate and adopt children - homosexuals should be denied most civil\r\nrights, because they are supposed to have adopted a life style that is disordered !\r\nIn fact, children need  no more protection from homosexuals, who have\r\nas such no motivation to \"convert\" anyone to anything, than from left-handed\r\npeople! Contrariwise, it would be easy to put together an argument in favour\r\nof protecting children from religious fundamentalists of all kinds: including\r\nSecularists and conservative Catholics!"

She rightly points out that Newman also said that the \"dictate\" of conscience \"in order to prevail against the voice\r\nof the Pope, must follow upon serious thought, prayer and all available\r\nmeans of arriving at a right judgement on the matter in question\" also that the conscience must be convinced not just that it is allowable\r\nto ignore the Magisterium, but that it would be positively harmful\r\nto obey its command or accept its teaching. \"Unless\r\na man is able to say to himself as in the presence of God, that he must\r\nnot and dare not, act upon the Papal injunction, he is bound to obey it\r\nand would commit a great sin in disobeying it\" . Newman was quite\r\nclear that what people often claimed as a right to conscience was\r\nnothing more than a pretence to the counterfeit \"right\r\nof self-will\" . [Newman: \"Certain Difficulties\r\nfelt by anglicans in Catholic Teaching\" II 261,258,250] On the other\r\nhand, she does a disservice to Newman when she asserts that he believed\r\nthe standard conservative dogma that the litmus test of a true religious\r\nspirit was obedience. She further points out that conscience can never set what is objectively\r\nright and wrong. Justice is not malleable. As my first quote from Michael\r\nDavies' pamphlet implies, the individual has no no right to decide for himself what is right and what is wrong, though Iwould add that he\r\nhas the duty to seek to discern it . Nevertheless, Sr Waddelove correctly\r\nadmits that conscience must always be obeyed, even when it is somehow\r\nmisguided . She then states that we have two means of discovering what\r\nis just: the Natural Law (but she then passes over this, in haste) and\r\nDivine Revelation. She then equates the latter with the Magisterium and\r\nthen suggests that Holy Mother Church makes solemn declarations on faith\r\nand morals which are to be taken as the voice of Christ Himself .\r\nShe then glibly asserts that this constitutes sure guidance for the\r\nformation of conscience. In this Sr Waddelove ignores or underestimates the importance of: the Natural\r\nLaw , which is immediately accessible to every human being and is the\r\nimperative behind all rational judgements of what is just. It should be noted that in Catholic thought, conscience is generally\r\nequated with the reason as applied to moral decisions. According to Pope John-Paul II \"conscience is a practical\r\njudgement .... an application of the law to a particular case.\" [Veritatis\r\nSplendor #59] Contrariwise, most people use the word conscience to signify an intuition of right and wrong: their experience of instinctive premises being\r\nproposed to their reasons by the Natural Law. As Pope John-Paul II (inconsistently) puts it \"conscience\r\nis ... an inner dictate for the individual, a summons to do what\r\nis good in this particular situation\" [Veritatis\r\nSplendor #59] the Scriptures, which can be read and properly understood by anyone conversant\r\nwith the Living Apostolic Tradition. the Fathers, whose legacy can be read and properly understood by anyone\r\nconversant with the Living Apostolic Tradition. the regrettable historical fact that the Magisterium is only too fallible . Sr Waddelove then takes some delight in disparaging conscience. She points\r\nout that it can make mistakes, and that such mistakes are not always innocent.\r\nShe suggests that because of original sin , one\r\nshould expect a (wo)man's conscience to be mistaken in many matters. This\r\nsounds suspiciously like the Lutheran doctrine of \" Utter\r\nDepravity \". The distinct impression is that one's best option is to\r\nnot worry about thinking issues through for oneself on the basis of objective\r\nvalues such as equity and freedom. Rather, it is safer to learn by rote\r\nthe current policy positions of the Magisterium and apply these uncritically.\r\nIn this way one avoids all moral responsibility for one's actions. If the\r\nMagisterium turns out to have got it wrong, it is always possible to say\r\n\"Iwas only following orders\". This is, of course, an immoral \"cop out\". It is quite possible for someone\r\nto opt out of their God-given personal responsibility to judge right\r\nfrom wrong and then to act justly , from sloth. To such a person, unquestioning\r\nconformance to the Official Teaching of the Magisterium is the easy, painless,\r\nstress free option. Such a person sins, perhaps mortally ,\r\neven when they believe and do what is objectively right, because their\r\nmotivation is at heart negligent and imprudent. Sr Waddelove concludes her article by quoting Pope John Paul II"

For of this conscience it is elsewhere said that it condemns\r\nand is not condemned, and judges a man but is not judged, as John says\r\nin the words: 'If our conscience condemn us\r\nnot, we have boldness towards God' .

Finally, Iknow from experience\r\nthat it is easy to produce feelings of\r\nguilt, simply by accusing someone of mischief.

Similarly, many feelings\r\nof guilt and shame associated with sex are inappropriate reflexive\r\nresponses induced by social taboos and arbitrary decencies. To an extent, conscience as reason can be applied to other data, such\r\nas the merely physiological. However, to deduce ethical conclusions from\r\npremises such as \"it is necessary to breath in order to live\", extra-scientific\r\nvalue judgements have to be recognized, such as \"it is good to live\" and\r\n\"it is bad to coerce another rational person\": hence, \"it is wrong to strangle\r\nsomeone\". The American (atheist) philosopher Ayn\r\nRand has proposed that the single ethical premise required is simply \"being\r\nis good\". Iam very sympathetic towards this view, but Iam not convinced\r\nthat it has been adequately established or elucidated. In any case, it\r\nis not possible to deduce any ethical conclusions about, for example, particular\r\nsexual behaviours from a simple observation such as that \"the physiological\r\nbasis for the existence of gender is reproduction\"."

The dissent that allows one to use contraception because\r\nit makes one's own life easier is also immoral. For dissent to be anything\r\nother than harmful, it has to be birthed in pain and fire, otherwise it\r\nwill lead to cynical scepticism and a loss of all faith. Dissent based\r\non a consciousness of an injustice done to some individual or group because\r\nof the imposition of some mistaken doctrine or practice is a different\r\nmatter. This is a matter of charity for the victim(s) of injustice. It\r\nis a prime duty for every person of good will to defend victims of injustice:\r\neven if the perpetrator of the injustice is the\r\nMagisterium itself! It must be remembered that \"Error has no rights\"\r\nand this is as applicable to the case when the Magisterium is in error as to that when a private individual is mistaken. The Magisterium has a responsibility to respect the conscience of individuals,\r\nsimply because it has a responsibility for the welfare of all. Concern\r\nfor the \" Common Good\" can only be based on a\r\nconcern for the good of the individual, and central to this is a healthy,\r\nactive and respected conscience. For the Magisterium to act in any way\r\nthat violates the conscience of an individual is immoral. This does not\r\nmean to say that the Magisterium has to respect or tolerate error. The\r\nduty to proclaim the authentic Apostolic Tradition involves delineating\r\nwhat is right from what is wrong, as best can be done: and those who freely\r\nassociate themselves with anathematized doctrine in conscience ,\r\nthereby exclude themselves from the visible unity of the Roman Jurisdiction.\r\nOf course, they may have good (though inadequate) reasons for making the\r\nchoice that they do and so be subjectively innocent of serious sin. An interesting question arises. What about the issue of ordaining\r\nwomen to the Apostolic ministry? Ihave made it clear elsewhere that Ibelieve there is no rational basis on which the present doctrinal\r\nposition can be sustained. It is incoherent. Clearly, then, it is unfair to those women who aspire to the Apostolic ministry to deny them this means\r\nof service, but is it an injustice towards them? I'm not sure. On\r\nthis basis alone, Ithink it would be difficult to recommend any kind of\r\ncampaigning dissent. Indeed, because it would undoubtedly be harmful to\r\necumenical prospects with the Eastern\r\nOrthodox Church for the Roman Jurisdiction to ordain women, a case\r\ncan be made out for this issue to be \"left on the back burner\" for the\r\ntime being. Still, Isuppose an injustice is being done to the laity as\r\na whole, for they are suffering as a result of being denied pastors who\r\nwould be able to serve them well. Moreover, the recent papal letter which\r\ntried to stifle all debate on this matter upped the stakes. The issue now\r\nis not whether a woman can be made a priest, but whether it is right for\r\nthe Pope to forbid all Catholics from questioning a matter that has not\r\nbeen defined. Clearly, this is a matter of sufficient gravity to merit\r\nexplicit challenge! What of the case when an individual rebels from erroneous Church teaching\r\nbecause they have an intuition that it is wrong, but have not properly\r\nthought this through and to an extent acts precipitously? Objectively they\r\nact justly, and the Magisterium is wrong to impose its error on the faithful.\r\nNevertheless, the individual should have paid more respect to the Teaching\r\nOffice before deciding to dissent. Yet, in fact they were right in their\r\ninformal conclusion and the actions that flowed from it, and it was wrong\r\nthat they were ever put in the position that they were. Has the individual\r\nin question: sinned mortall y: because they were imprudent to reject the mistaken\r\nteaching of the Magisterium, which they had a duty to presume trustworthy; sinned venially : because somehow the matter is of limited\r\nconsequence or acted virtuously : in accordance with the Natural Law, which they instinctively obeyed,\r\nin a \"child-like\" manner; rather than respecting a normally trusted voice\r\nwhich on this occasion spoke falsely?"

However, as Ihave already intimated, it is itself\r\nan error to coerce others , except in emergency, even for their own\r\ngood! Hence, for the Church to act with hostility towards protagonists\r\nof other faiths is generally counter \r\nproductive. Debate, discussion and dialogue is a more appropriate response.\r\nThis is the best way of encouraging the adherents of other religions to\r\nconsider the intellectual case for Catholicism. On the other hand, even\r\nthe appearance of prayer in\r\ncommon (as at Assisi) is to be avoided, because this countenances the\r\nidea that another religion is equivalently valid. While it is praiseworthy\r\nfor the faithful to be warned of what is understood to be wrong with for\r\nexample Islam , Buddhism or Shinto:\r\nit is profoundly inappropriate to condemn adherents of non-Christian religions\r\nas damned, and the positive values and aspects of these traditions should\r\nbe readily and enthusiastically acknowledged."

The latter danger can be most easily addressed\r\nby educating the laity, not intimidating them! If the Church had true courage\r\nin Her convictions, then She wouldn't be so keen to use threats\r\nof damnation to dissuade her ignorant children from repudiating Her\r\njurisdiction nor violence to coerce those who have once left, back into\r\nHer fold. It should be admitted that the Catholic Church is a far from perfect participation in the ideals of the \"Body of Christ\" and \"Kingdom of God\". Equally, it\r\nshould be clearly admitted that many who reject the Catholic faith or Roman\r\njurisdiction have excellent (if never adequate) grounds for doing so, and\r\nare in good faith. The typical evangelical protestant may be a lot closer\r\nto God than his Catholic contemporary: whether (s)he be lay (wo)man, or\r\nhierarch. Ecumenism is a necessary aspect of the\r\nevangelism of non-Catholic christians, for many reasons, such as: The Catholic Church has much to learn from other Christian bodies. The Catholic Church may influence other Christian bodies, so reducing the\r\nperceived differences. Working together for common aims (e.g. justice and peace) can cement friendship\r\nand establish trust. Sympathetic theological debate may produce a real convergence\r\nof doctrine . Ecumenical familiarity may make it easier for individuals to become\r\nCatholic . Agrowth in understanding may pave the way for the reconciliation of entire\r\njurisdictions with Rome."

The fear of the priest is always that the trouble-maker\r\nhe is opposing might just turn out to be prophetic and enunciating the judgement of God! To an extent, the difficulty is of\r\nthe hierarchy's own manufacture. Dissidents often are constructed by the\r\nhierarchy's own unwillingness to engage in dialogue with the rest of the Church. If a person or group comes to realize that\r\ntheir voice or need or experience is being discounted in a matter that\r\nis important to them then they have no choice but to dissent. This involves\r\neither public protest or private reservation. Take the example of \" Tridentinism \". This\r\nwould never have arisen if Paul VIth had not apparently\r\noutlawed the celebration of the traditional liturgy and autocratically imposed the Novus Ordo Missae. Take the example of \" Women Priests \".\r\nThe present discipline could have been continued while polite and restrained\r\ndebate went on. While important, this issue is not urgent: unlike many\r\nothers which the Magisterium studiously avoids addressing. There was no\r\njustification for the recent papal attempt to impose uniformity of thought\r\nwithout the bother of infallibly defining exactly the point at issue. This\r\nmight have (in prudence) involved consulting at least the rest of the hierarchy, if not the wider Church! Take the example of \" Contraception \".\r\nPaul VIth went to the trouble of constituting a commission to report on\r\nthis subject, and then disregarded its conclusions. This turned the majority\r\nof the laity (Isuspect) into de-facto dissidents and did incalculable\r\nharm to the credability of the Magisterium. Take the example of \" Homosexuality \". For\r\nalmost two thousand years the Magisterium of the Church remained silent\r\non this subject. For substantial periods of time ecclesial attitudes were\r\neither tolerant or affirmatory. Why did it suddenly become necessary for\r\nRome to enunciate such derogatory judgements? Does the Church need a group to vilify? Now that it has decided it can no longer target Jews ,\r\nWitches and Muslims , has it\r\nidentified homosexuals as the most convenient \"whipping boy\"? There is no need for me to set out here the sensible path of action,\r\nas this has been done for me in great detail and with much wisdom, by the late Cardinal Bernadin."

This means that the most repressive measures open to a Catholic State\r\nare to deny dissidents any right of access to the public media. to distribute their own literature in public. to advertise their existence or activities. of public assembly. to build, hire or buy premises for the sole or primary purpose of worship\r\nor assembly. The State could also sponsor \"public information\" warnings against dissidents. Of course, some of these measures would serve little purpose and others\r\nwould be counter productive. In practice it might be better to employ very\r\nmuch gentler measures. It would be illegitimate to deny dissidents the right: to produce literature for their own use or to pass on to others, in private. to attempt to persuade others to adopt their beliefs, in private. to assemble, in private. to use premises that they own for other legitimate purposes as places of\r\nworship or assembly. to form \"front organizations\" with legitimate ends. to publicize the activities of such front organizations, as long as their\r\ndissident character is not apparent. It would also be wrong to have any kind of legal presumption that a person\r\nwho becomes a dissident is \"mentally incompetent\" or has been \"brain-washed\",\r\nand so should be subject to psychiatric treatment such as \"de-programming\". In my opinion, the only sensible measure would be to restrict the style\r\nand position of buildings dedicated to dissident use so as to make them\r\nunobtrusive. If the State were to act to protect its citizens from all\r\nperceived \"wrong ideas\", then healthy political free speech, science and\r\nphilosophy would be under serious threat. Innovative and imaginative insights\r\nin most fields of human endeavour are too\r\noften first rejected by the establishment as wrong-headed, subversive\r\nand dangerous!"

      "text": "Quite by accident, Ihave recently read J.S. Mill's monograph on \"Liberty\".\r\nIfound it to be an exciting and thought provoking book, and heartily recommend\r\nit. Mill points out that there are a number of reasons for allowing or\r\neven encouraging dissent: Received conventional or \"traditional\" wisdom is entirely wrong. In which case the only hope that truth and justice may be attained is by\r\ngiving head to dissenting voices. Aminority view should not be allowed to prevail or be accepted as correct\r\nany more than the majority view: but it requires more institutional support\r\nand consideration just because it is a minority or dissident view. Generally, dissident views are repressed and silenced by overbearing authority:\r\nhierarchical, social or economic, with no account as to their rightness\r\nor justice. On those occasions that unconventional truth has prevailed against popular\r\nfalsehood, it has done so when civil or social authority has been in a\r\nstate of flux, and so vulnerable to such a healthy subversion. Agood example, is the official Catholic and Orthodox teaching on \"love,\r\nsex and friendship\". Received conventional or \"traditional\" wisdom is partly right and partly\r\nwrong. In which case, the corrective or complement of its partial truth may be\r\nsupplied by some dissident view; itself only partly right. Agood example here is the necessary dialogue between Western Catholicism\r\nand Eastern Orthodoxy. Received conventional or \"traditional\" wisdom is entirely correct. Without the challenge of debate, it will ossify into what Cardinal Newman\r\ncalled \"Notional Assent\". This is an empty formal acceptance of some proposition as being true, with\r\nno understanding of what it signifies, and certainly without the acceptance\r\nof its truth having any practical impact on the conduct of one's life! This is typical of most Catholics today. It is the entire basis of conventional \"Ecumenism\". Because their faith is neither challenged by external persecution nor by\r\ntheir own attempts to convert non-Catholics to the True Faith, most Catholics\r\nhave little idea of what in fact they believe. The irritent of dissidence (but of disidence challenged and engaged, not\r\nsimply winked at and \"tollerated\") is necessary to produce the pearls of\r\npractical wisdom and living faith. The acceptance of dogma, on the basis of \"authority\" alone is an empty\r\nacceptance, and no amount of positive study and rationalisation can make\r\nup the deficit left once the external challenge of controversy has been\r\nlost. While the hot restlessness of heretics stirs\r\nup questions about many things belonging to the Catholic faith, in order\r\nto provide a defense against these heretics we are obliged to study the\r\npoints questioned more diligently, to understand them more clearly, \r\nand to preach them more forcefully; and thus the question raised by the\r\nadversary becomes the occasion for instruction.

Quarum una, scilicet quae est ex conscientia,\r\nest maior, quia intensior; minor vero quia solubilior; alia vero e contrario.\r\nObligatio enim illa quae est ad praelatum, solvi non potest, sicut conscientia\r\nerronea potest deponi. To the first it must be said, that he\r\nwho has vowed obedience, is held to obey in those things to which the\r\ngood of obedience extends itself ; neither is he freed from that obligation\r\nby an error of conscience, nor again is he freed from the duty of conscience\r\nby that obligation ; and thus there remains in him a double contrary\r\nobligation. Of which the one, to wit that which is of the conscience, is\r\ngreater, in that it is intenser; and lesser in that it is more soluble.\r\nThe other one from the contrary. For the obligation which exists to the\r\nprealte, cannot be dissovled, as the erroneous conscinece can be set aside. De veritate, q. 17 a. 5 ad 2 Ad secundum dicendum, quod quamvis opus illud\r\nper se sit indifferens, tamen ex dictamine conscientiae fit non indifferens.

De veritate, q. 17 a. 5 ad 4 Ad quartum dicendum, quod subditus, non habet\r\niudicare de praecepto praelati, sed de impletione praecepti, quae ad ipsum\r\nspectat. Unusquisque enim tenetur actus suos examinare ad scientiam quam\r\na Deo habet, sive sit naturalis, sive acquisita, sive infusa: omnis enim\r\nhomo debet secundum rationem agere. To the fourth it msut be said, that the subject\r\ndoes not have to judge the commandment of the prelate, but rather the carrying\r\nout of the command, which is expected of him. For Everyone is beholden\r\nto examine his own deeds according to the knowledge which he has from God,\r\nwether that be natural, or acquired, or infused: for every man must act\r\naccording to reason."
