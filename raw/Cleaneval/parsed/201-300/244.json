After\r\nthey are done with the regular schooling, they come to the TF operated\r\nschool. In some cases dropout children are coached for the open school\r\nexams. The school operates from  5PM to 8PM and uses the premises\r\none local municipal school called the Dharamdas Trust Model School. TF\r\nhas 36 staff including 21 teachers. They run classes for children from\r\nPP (preprimary) to the std XII. There are fewer children in the higher\r\nclasses but in the next couple of years, there should be lot more. TF operates in an old part of the city - Kalighat. It is surrounded by\r\nslums. There are a few thousand families in the area covered by this\r\norganization. Most of the children come from poor families but some\r\nmothers are prostitutes. Ivisited a couple of slums - Sarat Bose and Masjid which Italk about\r\nlater in this report. TF believes in overall development of the child. The evening school is\r\nplace to (1) continue the formal learning (2) improve mental and\r\nphysical health, and (3) provide hope, vision and preparation for\r\nfuture  for the children, and (3) reaching out to the community\r\nthrough the children."

They\r\nhave shown considerable innovation w.r.t keeping the children\r\nmotivated, involving the community, and working with the local\r\ngovernment. This visit comes approximately 10 years after they started\r\nand while everything is done as yet, it appears that they are pretty\r\nsuccessful in their effort to retain and motivate children. It is an\r\ninteresting experiment, and throws up many questions regarding the role\r\nof NGOs, government, parents and education."

      "text": "Reached Kalighat subway station at around 2PM. One of staff members,\r\nKaustub, came to\r\npick me up from the station. The Tomorrow's Foundation office was less\r\nthan 10 min walk from the station. Iwas introduced all the staff there - Anitaji - External relations Ashish Dey - Teaching Kasturi di - Counseling Shiela - Home visit Cell Kaustub - Accounts Chanchal - Assistant Arpan - Teacher and replacement coordinator when Ashish is\r\nnot around. and later on Ashish Roy - Project Coordinator Tanushree Roy - Ex-home visit cell Totally there are 36 staff - who take one or more classes.\r\nSome come during certain days of the week. There were a couple of folks who came in later from a local college who\r\nwere interning with TF. The office has three rooms one each for Mamoni and Ashish. Another for\r\nrest of the staff (accounting, cells etc.) Igave an update on the sanctuary conference which happened that same\r\nweek in Mysore, and talked about\r\nAshis's presentation there. Shortly after Ireached office, children started flowing in. They hung\r\naround for some time before going to the evening school run by\r\nTomorrow's Foundation at the local Dharamdas School. They recited poem\r\nand sang songs for me. While Iwas there\r\nthree girls from the open school (Std X) came back after writing their\r\nhistory exam. They seem satisfied enough with their performance but\r\nthey hope to do better in the next couple of exams - one of which is\r\nbengali and another is biology.  Then Igave a  short test on\r\ngeography and political map of india.\r\nThey kept getting confused but made progress. Igave them some simple\r\ntips on writing exams. An interesting thing happened: One of the girls wanted to come to US. Iasked why. She replied that she likes to watch WWF and if she comes to\r\nUS she can see WWF for real. Itried convincing them that the whole\r\nshow is scripted but they refused to believe it. Later Kasturi di\r\n(Counseling) explained to me the significance of WWF. They saw the WWF\r\nfights give a vent to aggression building up in them from within.\r\nSubtle but unmistakable if you are looking for clues. Ileft for the school slightly after 5PM. By the time Ireached, the\r\nprayer was over and children were in their classes. Ivisited each\r\nclass starting from PP (pre-primary to 12th). In higher classes there\r\nwere relatively few students. Imet some star candidades whose name Ihad only heard of before. Iwent into each class and greeted everyone.\r\nChildren naturally welcomed from the interruption. Some of the classes\r\nwere preparing from exams or taking mocks. The PP and Standard Ichildren were particularly excited. The standard\r\nIchildren rushed towards me. Most wanted to shake hands with me and\r\ntry their latest technique for that involving the thumb and the little\r\nfinger.\r\nSome (embarrasingly) wanted to touch my feet - a local custom\r\nbeing drilled into their minds. Ispent almost 1 hour (one period) with Standard 4. Idiscussed India's\r\ngeography. They were quite eager to converse about anything and\r\neverything, and asked many questions. They made me sing and one of them\r\nalso sang. It was the\r\nmost fun part of my visit. Just before leaving one small girl gave me greeting card and ran away\r\nbefore Irealized. She drew a nice picture of a home with crayons and\r\nwrote her name and class at the back. Cool! Apparently thats the\r\nresponsibility of Class I. Chanchal dropped me off at Ashish and Tanushree's place. We caught up\r\non the conference happenings."

      "text": "Visit to HWH Site: Day started with a visit to the Half Way Home construction site. (See\r\nthe pictures). The Half Way Home is a temporary shelter for children in\r\nneed - there are about 3-4 crisis situations everyweek. There was also\r\na need to consolidate TF activities. With support from Asha and others,\r\nthey bought some land in Kolkata suburbs near Ruby Hospital off a major\r\nhighway. The construction has begun in December. Half Way Home was one\r\nof the benificiaries of the Asha WAH 2003 effort. The Half Way Home has been expanded since the original WAH proposal was\r\nmade - now it is a four storeyed building with an\r\nimpressive design contributed by an italian. It is about 20-30 min from\r\nthe Goria (Ashish's place) and also from Raash Beharee (where TF\r\noffice  is). The construction workers were digging the plot - wet,\r\nclayey soil - to lay the foundation. Since the place is away from the\r\nmainroad (bypass) and there is nothing but a lake behind, it appears\r\nthat the children of half way home can get some space to play outside.\r\nKalighat area is too crowded. There is a worry about malaria because\r\nthe lake has stagnant water - but that may not be a new problem. there\r\nare\r\nponds and mosquitos all over the place. Interestingly the local community, after coming to know about the\r\nobjective of the place, agitated against the construction. TF using\r\nsome local contacts were able to convince them. Office: Swarup dropped in to meet me. He updated me (along with Ashish and\r\nAnitaji) about the finances - how the budget of the HWH has grown and\r\nhow they pooling in money to complete it. At a later point in time Italked to Arup who was in Delhi. He talked about how the organization\r\nhas grown and how they are trying to keep it a consistent effort. Iupdated him about the recently held sanctuary conference. Iasked about\r\nthe TF Card project and future plans for them. The TF Card project is a vocational training center for the older\r\nchildren. The products include cards, lamp shades, books etc. The\r\nrevenue of this center is around 2 lakhs which is sufficient to break\r\neven and generate some profit. The main issue seems to (1) the high\r\ncost of the raw material - because they buy in small quantities (2) the\r\ndemands are seasonal. There is a possibility that Asha can source material from TF - if we\r\ncan figure out how to make it happen. The key issue is  the costs\r\nof transport. Harlett School: Ipaid a brief visit to Harlett school (a christian missionary school)\r\nwhere a bunch of TF students\r\nwere participating in the their (Harlett School's) Christmas Day\r\ncelebration. They were a\r\nfew solos and a short skit -- all with ease in front of a crowd of\r\nabout 2-300 students. They got a genuine and long applause. One girl in\r\nparticular had a truely wonderful voice. Iwanted to meet her on Day 3\r\nbut she was absent. Imet her mother, though. She (mother) came to meet\r\nTF staff\r\nfor some reason. Conseling Cell: Ispent a couple of hours with Kasturi talking about the psychological\r\nimpact of TF environment on children. She discussed case studies of\r\nvarious children and how they handle them. There are some key skills\r\nrequired for this (1)  figuring out when exactly something is\r\nwrong with a child. they show up primarily in changed behavior. (2)\r\ntalking to figure out what exactly the problem is - everything from\r\nadolescence-related issues to problems at home. This sometimes take\r\nmultiple sessions - in one case 20 sessions. Kasturi di also handles\r\ncareer counseling. There are a couple of tests which atleast to a first\r\napproximation can tell us about interests about the child. Sometimes a\r\nnote is passed to the teachers asking them to pay special attention to\r\na particular child and teachers comes back with observations. All these\r\nare documents are maintained in a per-child folder. Igot to see a few\r\nbut did not have time to read the notes in detail. Unstable families - domestic violence, drunkard father, broken homes,\r\nloss of livelihood - are the key reasons for dropping out. Poor\r\nmotivation and lack of family interest add to it. Other issues such as\r\npoor documentation (date of birth), lack of proper shelter esp. during\r\nrainy seasons also contribute to the problem. There are standard (psychology) tests apparently give reasonably good\r\nhints about the child - interests and mental state. The case load is higher during monsoon and during exams. Home Visit: Iwent along with Ashish and Shiela on a home visit to the surrounding\r\nslums.  Ivisited the slums of Sarat Bose and\r\nMasjid. The homes in Sarat Bose are small but generally appear to be\r\nclean - no stink from open drains. Masjid was more run down. This walk\r\nserves multiple purposes  (1) to figure out what the issue is with\r\nspecific children who have not been turning up at school (2) to urge\r\nchildren who get distracted with activity on the street and forget\r\nabout TF school, and (3) to identify children who are not attending\r\nschool. This appears to be quite effective. There were only a couple\r\nhouses with absentee children. This trip was short and there didnt\r\nappear to be any outstanding issues (except with one child who's uncle\r\nexpired). School: Ispent more than an hour with standard 6. Pinaki was incharge. He let\r\nme spend time. Ididnt have much problem with language. Many of the\r\nchildren\r\nknew hindi. They like to sing and dance - something that Ifound they\r\nall\r\nwant to do all the time. They talked about many things including\r\nfavorite bollywood\r\nstars. Somewhere in the middle Imentioned about the personal histories\r\nof a public figures. It really got them interested. They couldnt\r\nbelieve\r\nthat somebody could start small and do well. They repeatedly asked me\r\nif it was true. Ithen realized how they have built mental limits for\r\nthemselves. Igave a pep talk on why it was possible, and the\r\nimportance of school and attending classes. One of them confessed about\r\ndifficulties that she was having with math. Another jumped in and\r\nconfessed the same about History. Ispent the rest of class giving them\r\ntips on classes and tried to motivate them about the various classes\r\nthey take."

      "text": "Ispent the initial part of Day 3 (saturday) visiting another\r\norganization, Sanlaap. Icame back to the school for the evening\r\nclasses. This was undoubtedly the most exciting day for the children - only\r\ncultural activities were scheduled. There were yoga, drawing, singing,\r\ndancing and drama classes. The children were free to choose whatever\r\ninterests them. The dance\r\nclass is the clear winner by a huge margin. Almost everyone wanted to\r\nbe in it. The staff was very impressive. Ispent most of my time with\r\nthe drama class though. The\r\nteacher was quite accomplished, Ibelieve, from National School of\r\nDrama. He has been with TF with more than two years. When Ientered his\r\nclass, he\r\nwas discussing scenes from Shakespeare's Hamlet and enacting bits and\r\npieces of it.\r\nLater his discussed a little bit of Macbeth as well -- all to students\r\nwho are\r\nbetween 3 and 8th standards. Iread Macbeth when Iwas in Class 12! The\r\nclass was preparing for the upcoming\r\nannual function on Jan 31. Iasked him what the story would be. He said\r\nhe does know as yet. He plans to \"share his experiences with the\r\nchildren\", and they will come up with something _together_. The final\r\ndrama might be a collage. He expressed confidence in the children's\r\nabilities and creativity. The children apparently have figured out the\r\nbasic stage management, lighting and sound principles. Iwould have\r\nloved to have such a teacher who gives so much room for creativity of\r\nthe children. Ileft with the comment that\r\nenacting Macbeth, whatever be the length of the piece, in 5th standard\r\ncan do wonders to their confidence. Ileft the next day morning."

      "text": "Ispent all  three evenings with Ashish Roy talking about the\r\nphilosophy and operation of TF. 1. What is TF's role TF's role is encourage a change in mindset of people. Children - create\r\nawareness of their rights. Parents- awareness about their\r\nresponsibilities, Local government - make them aware of their\r\nresponsibility to support institutions like TF. The key technique used\r\nwas to provide partial solution and motivate the parents/government to\r\nprovide the rest. If this meant delay and pain, so be it. 2. Conduct of TF staff TF staff all wear bright clothes and always cheerful. The point is a\r\nsubtle one. It is to create a sense of liveliness and confidence - and\r\ncreate the enthusiasm to attain that stage. Acouple of the staff are products of TF. They provide effective role\r\nmodels - always in front of them. 4. General points to ponder upon (not specific TF but a result of a\r\nnumber of discussions with people and visits to other organizations): (a) How do we ensure that for any given family, this generation is the\r\nlast one which require help? (b) NGOs have vested interest in sustaining the problem (e.g., a\r\ncertain number of derived children) because their livelihood\r\ndepends on it. So have to be careful while dealing with them. By using\r\nspecific words (e.g., devadasi) they may actually help keep the problem\r\ndomain alive."
