      "text": "Major\r\nOwen E. Jensen The application of lessons of the past to current and predicted military issues\r\nalways required a proper appreciation of changed technological conditions, but not until\r\nthe latter half of the nineteenth century did the problem of adjustment offer any\r\ndifficulties. In the twentieth century it became increasingly critical, and with the\r\nadvent of nuclear weapons the entire value of past military experience as a guide to the\r\nfuture was called basically into question. Bernard Brodie 1 THIS seems to be conventional wisdom: nuclear weapons have changed everything. Yet in\r\nmany respects the nuclear age can be seen not as a break with past strategic theory but as\r\nthe culmination of the evolution of strategy--the latest (and perhaps final) stage of\r\nmilitary thought. While many tactical principles--whether of a general nature, such as the\r\nbenefits offered by holding \"interior lines,\" or of a specific nature, such as\r\nFrederick the Great's \"oblique order of march\"--may indeed by outdated,\r\nprinciples of grand strategy have continued to evolve. Military thinkers of the past were not necessarily wrong in their identification of\r\nunderlying elements of grand strategy, but they may have been wrong in seeing those\r\nelements as constant and unchanging. Similar themes, ideas, and principles have seemed to\r\nrecur in every conflict, but their recurrence over time was on a constantly ascending\r\nscale. In this article, Ishall discuss specific instances to support this thesis, but at\r\nthis point one other general thought needs to be considered. That is the idea that grand\r\nstrategy developed differently in what we now call the Western nations (particularly in\r\nthe United States) than it did in the Soviet Union. Although both are equally rooted in\r\nclassical strategic theory and both are valid expressions of grand strategy, the\r\nstrategies of today's East-West rivals, like races of men evolved from a single ancestor,\r\ngradually acquired distinctive features. With this in mind, let us examine the origins of\r\nU.S. nuclear strategy, then consider options to that strategy, and, finally, assess the\r\nimpact of opposing choices on decisions for or against ballistic missile defense."

      "text": "He then qualified his concept, however, and allowed that wars were not theory but\r\nreality, and in reality they are not fought merely for the sake of violence but to achieve\r\npolitical goals. Clausewitz also stressed that military aims had to be subjugated to\r\npolitical goals and that \"this conception would be ineluctable even if war were total\r\nwar.\" 4 Today, in an era in which a first strike may be the entire war,\r\ndomination of military aims by political goals is paramount not only in theory but in\r\nreality as well. In no nation today is the military given advance approval for first use\r\nof nuclear weapons. Historically (and even today regarding conventional weapons), military\r\ncommanders have been authorized to fire back if fired upon. However, this authorization\r\ndoes not apply to nuclear weapons. For almost every contingency, advance approval for even\r\nsecond (or responsive) use of nuclear devices has been withheld. Because the destructive\r\ncapacity of weaponry has increased to the point where policy controls military\r\nimperatives, Clausewitz's dictum has reached its purest form. The main question, however, is whether there are any political goals that may be\r\nachieved by nuclear weapons. Hasn't the awesome power of such weapons canceled out any\r\npossibility that war can even be considered as a political instrument? That answer may\r\nalso be found in Clausewitz and an examination of the evolution of military\r\nhistory, expressed as: Political goals themselves must be realistic and not overreach military\r\ncapabilities. Clausewitz defined war as an \"act of force to compel our enemy to do our\r\nwill\" 5 and pointed out that mere destruction of forces or occupation of\r\nterritory was sometimes insufficient to accomplish that goal. He noted his own native\r\nPrussia as an example where complete defeat and occupation (by Napoleon) nevertheless\r\nfailed to effect a lasting change of will. To the contrary, Napoleon's\r\noverambitious political goals eventually led to significant, permanent changes mostly for\r\nhis own country, France. The lessons of this are twofold: If an attacker realizes\r\nthat by prosecuting a total war (versus a limited war) it may be in danger of allowing\r\npolitical goals to exceed military capability and thereby risking the destruction of\r\nitself, the very society it is attempting to impose or protect, then the attacker would be\r\nfoolish to initiate the war at all; and if a defender is faced with the complete\r\nuprooting of the essence of its society, then it has nothing to fear by fighting to the\r\nbitter end--accepting total war as having no worse consequences than surrender. History is replete with examples. Athens had every prospect of maintaining its empire\r\nad infinitum until it decided to attempt complete hegemony in the middle of the\r\nPeloponnesian War by invading Sicily. By thus overreaching its military capability, the\r\nempire was lost. 6 Likewise, Carthage had the strength to maintain its territory\r\nversus Rome, but by resorting to total war, it lost totally. When the third Punic War was\r\nover, \"nine-tenths of the [Carthaginian] population had perished. . . . By order of\r\nthe Roman Senate . . . [Carthage] was completely destroyed, and the survivors sold as\r\nslaves.\" 7 The reason why no decisive \"Napoleonic\" victories were\r\nachieved in the American Civil War while they were won in the Austro-Prussian and\r\nFranco-Prussian wars was not that weapons technology had given a decisive advantage to the\r\ndefense (for the defending Europeans had weapons of equal destructive power), but that the\r\nNorth was attempting to impose a totally new order on the South, which caused an\r\nescalation to total war. In Europe, on the other hand, Bismarck and Moltke made it plain\r\nthat their objectives were much more limited and not worth complete mutual destruction. In\r\ncontrast, Napoleon and Hitler risked all and lost all by allowing political goals to\r\nexceed military capability in the face of adversaries who were fighting for the\r\npreservation of their very societies. My point here is to suggest that because nuclear war today has evolved into what would\r\nbe an act of total violence (a concept that for Clausewitz was merely abstract), it has\r\ncrystallized the ultimate consequences, and therefore the choices, involved in total war.\r\nWhere it was possible for Athens, Carthage, Napoleonic France, or Nazi Germany to\r\nmistakenly contemplate victory or at the worst (if defeated) a maintenance of the prewar\r\nstatus quo, such error in thought is no longer possible. By evolving to its pure form, war\r\nhas identified its own consequences with absolute clarity. An attacker today does risk\r\ntotal destruction if it attacks a defender that can retaliate massively. Recall that Clausewitz held that if war were a \"complete, untrammeled, absolute\r\nmanifestation of violence (as the pure concept would require), war would of its own\r\nindependent will usurp the place of policy the moment policy had brought it into\r\nbeing.\" 8 That is obviously true today and was equally true in the past.\r\nCertainly for Carthage and to a lesser extent for both Germany and Russia in World War II,\r\nthe consequences of war rivaled the possible results of nuclear holocaust. The lesson is\r\nthat war has not changed from being a practical political instrument into an impractical\r\npolitical instrument in the nuclear era, but that at its extreme it was always\r\nimpractical. The difference is that as war's destructiveness has evolved in magnitude,\r\nthis lesson has, been made obvious where before it was obscured. The only way to use war\r\nas a policy instrument now (as before) is by limiting its application--either by\r\nrestraining political objectives or by increasing the effectiveness of defense."

At the beginning of the Civil War, \"the image\r\nof Napoleonic war with its brief, climactic battles had impressed itself upon the popular\r\nmind as well as upon soldiers . . . and it stimulated the usual popular impatience\r\n[especially in America] to have wars over with promptly.\" 10 Nearly every\r\none of the leading generals on both sides in the Civil War had been educated at West Point\r\nduring an era when the strategic thought of Jomini, Napoleon's Swiss expositor, provided\r\nthe bedrock of military instruction. Jomini made no secret of his preference for the\r\noffensive over the defensive and stressed that the whole purpose of strategy was to bring\r\nforces into battle with the object of destroying an enemy's army. Jomini called for\r\nboldness in warfare: \"Iwould make [war] brisk, bold, impetuous, perhaps sometimes\r\neven audacious.\" 11 As U.S. military strategy began to be employed beyond its own borders, it was\r\nembodied in the Navy; and naval thought at the time for all of the great naval powers\r\nfocused almost exclusively on the ideas of Alfred Thayer Mahan. Mahan pored through the pages of Jomini in his effort to formulate a new science of\r\n  naval strategy, and many of the principles of naval war which he suggested are naval\r\n  applications of Jomini's precepts. 1 2"

It may be safely stated that there was not\r\nan atom of support for defenses in all his work."

      "text": "The connection of Douhet to U.S. strategy was direct, via members of the Bolling\r\nCommission, who were considerably influenced by his concepts on a fact-finding tour\r\nexamining military aviation during 1917; 15 and indirect, in that Douhet merely\r\nexpressed what was generally a consensus of knowledgeable Western opinion of that time.\r\nSubsequently, U.S. air doctrine \"adopted Douhet's de-emphasis of fighters, whether\r\nfor defense or for escort of bombers, and a corresponding emphasis on destroying the\r\nenemy's air force at its bases.\" 16 Even General William \"Billy\"\r\nMitchell's writing (although it is largely tactical and probably not derived from the\r\nItalian) is \"pure Douhet\" 17 where it discusses the strategic use of\r\nair power. As the United States entered the nuclear era, its choices seemed almost preordained.\r\nAlthough at first, both air defense and strategic bombing progressed together under\r\nEisenhower's New Look strategy, clearly it was the offensive side that received the\r\nprimary emphasis; and whatever balance existed did not survive the transition to the\r\nmissile age. It was not the balanced offensive and defensive force structure advocated by\r\nBernard Brodie in his 1959 book, Strategy in the Missile Age, that was\r\nchosen, but rather the course advocated by Oskar Morgenstern in The Question of\r\nNational Defense (also 1959), which advocated reliance on the creation of powerful\r\nstrategic offensive forces. 18 During the Kennedy-Johnson McNamara years,\r\ndefenses against bombers were almost totally scrapped; and in the Nixon-Ford-Schlesinger\r\nyears, antiballistic missile systems were given up as well. As a result, the United States was left with an unnerving and rather absurd reliance on\r\na strategy of mutual assured destruction (MAD), trusting the fate of American society to\r\nthe rationality of nuclear adversaries. It was said to be in our U.S. interest to forgo\r\ndefenses totally in favor of the offense, making the nation vulnerable so that the other\r\nside would not suspect it of planning a first strike. To many observers, however, the MAD\r\nstrategy was shortsighted. It ignored the possibility of technological breakthroughs that\r\ncould render offensive forces themselves vulnerable and lead to dangerous consequences.\r\nOnly in North America, where the ravages of war were largely unknown, could vulnerability\r\nhave been conceived as an asset. As Henry Kissinger observed: One reason [behind this strategy] was the growth of the school of thought to which I,\r\n  myself, contributed . . . which considered that strategic stability was a military asset,\r\n  and in which the historically amazing theory developed that vulnerability contributed to\r\n  peace and invulnerability contributed to risks of war. Such a theory could develop and be\r\n  widely accepted only in a country that had never addressed the problem of the balance of\r\n  power as a historical phenomenon. And . . . only also on a continent which was looking for\r\n  any excuse to avoid analysis of the perils it was facing and that was looking for an easy\r\n  way out. 19"

      "text": "While U.S. strategic thought has focused almost entirely on the offensive over the past\r\ncentury, options recognizing the benefits of defensive strategy have evolved in other\r\nsocieties, most notably in the Soviet Union. These options were also rooted in past\r\nstrategic theory and practice. In the middle of the fourteenth century, the Battle of Crcy between forces under\r\nEdward III of England and Philip VI of France demonstrated the ability of the English\r\nlongbow to penetrate armor and overcome the theretofore unassailable dominance of mounted\r\nknights. For the first time in nearly a thousand years, defensive infantry gained the\r\nupper hand against mounted troops. 21 Previously heavy cavalry, employed\r\nexclusively on the attack, had dominated warfare; and armies unfortunate enough to find\r\nthemselves on the defensive had been forced to retreat inside fortresses and suffer the\r\nstarvation and privation of siege. Thus, technological change opened a new era of military\r\nhistory; and since Crcy (with its verdict solidly reaffirmed 70 years later at\r\nAgincourt), \"infantry has remained the primary element of ground combat forces.\" 22 Change indicated at Crcy, however, spread slowly to the armies of Europe.\r\nDecades passed before it began to impact military development in the Russian Empire, which\r\nat the time of Crcy was still being ravaged by mounted Mongolian armies. Nevertheless,\r\nthe ascendancy of common infantry, emphasizing the strength of Russian numbers, along with\r\ndefensive advantage offered by possession of vast territory for retreat and maneuver, was\r\nto have profound influence on the development of strategy in Russia. In 1708-09, the tactical genius of Charles XII of Sweden took him into combat deep in\r\nthe Ukraine, where Russian retreat, maneuver, and scorched-earth strategies brought the\r\nSwedish army to exhaustion and total defeat by a huge army under Peter the Great. 23 Apattern of Russian strategy was thereby established. It accepted severe sacrifices in\r\nterritory and lives while maintaining a strategic defensive to exhaust an adversary until\r\nhe could be overwhelmed. That strategy continues to this day. Even the great Napoleon, on whose campaigns offensive doctrine rests, experienced efeat\r\nfrom this simple but effective Russian strategy when he marched to Moscow in 1812.\r\nAlthough his final defeat was averted for some time; the final demise of his empire began\r\nwhen he crossed the Russian frontier and began pouring the resources of France upon empty\r\nsteppes. The implications of this lesson were largely ignored by one great Napoleonic\r\ninterpreter, Jomini, who chose instead to emphasize the magnificence of Napoleon's\r\nconquests. However, another interpreter, Clausewitz, understood the inherent strength of\r\ndefensive strategy and chose to stress heavily that \"defense is a stronger form of\r\nfighting than attack.\" 24 Thus a divergence in strategic theory began that\r\nemphasized the differing geopolitical realities in East and West and evolved to the\r\ndistinctly different military postures of today. These differences are particularly clear\r\nnow that weapons for strategic defense are considered separately from those of strategic\r\noffense and conscious choices must be made regarding which type of system will receive\r\nbudgetary allocations. Defeat for Russia in World War Iwas inextricably intertwined with internal political\r\ncollapse and revolution, but the civil war that followed found foreign expeditionary\r\nforces once more swallowed up by the vastness of the territory and the numerical\r\nsuperiority of a peasant army. In the Second World War, traditional Russian strategy was\r\nclassically employed yet again as Hitler met a fate nearly identical to that of Charles\r\nXII and Napoleon. By accepting losses in both land and manpower that would have been\r\ndisastrous for smaller nations, the Soviets absorbed the Nazi offensive thrust and\r\nhusbanded its strength until a killing counterblow could be delivered. Clausewitz may not\r\nhave approved of the crudity and inefficiency of the campaign, but he would have accepted\r\nthe conclusion as inevitable. In the nuclear age, the only change in fundamental Soviet strategy is that the\r\ncounterblow will not be delayed. While great sacrifices undoubtedly will have to be made,\r\nthis prospect is not a new idea. And at the same time that punishment is being accepted,\r\nit will be returned with overpowering force. However, aware that their nation has\r\nexperienced the ravages of invasion many times in its history, the Soviets are not content\r\nto entrust their fate merely to the rationality of their adversary and the ability of\r\ntheir empire to accept and survive an onslaught. They intend to mount an active\r\ndefense-in-depth and think it insane to do otherwise. In the mid- to late-1950s, when the soviets were assessing what kind of strategy and\r\n  matching capabilities were required for war in the nuclear age, an interlocking defense\r\n  network composed of antiaircraft/antiballistic missile systems and adequate protection for\r\n  the civilian population and industry was high on the list of priorities. . . . [Adecade\r\n  later, as Kosygin confessed to Lyndon Johnson, the Soviets were] palpably mystified by the\r\n  lack, after more than two decades of strategic competition, of a coherent American\r\n  doctrine and strategy for attaining a meaningful victory out of nuclear war. 25"

      "text": "History seems to show that a balance between offensive and defensive capability is\r\nneeded. As a Royal Air Force officer, reflecting on Douhet's theories after the Battle of\r\nBritain, commented: \"If it is true that 'the bomber will always get through,' as it\r\nis popularly stated, it is equally true that 'not all the bombers will get through'\r\nagainst adequate defenses.\" 27 With proper emphasis and investment in\r\nresearch, the same observation could be made regarding strategic missiles. And as the\r\nvarious elements of both active and passive defense are brought together, the contribution\r\nof each will be multiplied. It is only by looking at the \"whole\" effect of\r\ndefense along with the effects from offensive action that strategic possibilities can be\r\nexamined realistically. Asecond historical lesson applicable to today's choices between strategies and their\r\nassociated specialized weapons systems is the realization that military means must be\r\nrelated to political ends. This fundamental Clausewitzian precept has often been forgotten\r\nat great cost in the past. In World War I, for example, \"Foch gives little\r\nindications in his writings of having thought about the matter at all.... Yet if the total\r\nwar of the future is fated to be one where victory is pursued blindly, and therefore at\r\nwholly incommensurate costs which destroy its meaning, it will be more akin to the first\r\nthan the second of the two world wars.\" 28 Once a nation is equipped with\r\nsufficient offensive arms to obliterate its potential adversaries, further\r\nincreases in offensive weaponry add little to security or the advancement of political\r\ngoals. The cost of multiplying this offensive firepower is simply disproportionately high\r\nto the benefits derived. But that is not true of defensive investment--particularly in the United States where\r\nso little defense exists. In fact, initial expenditures on defensive measures would\r\nprobably bring the highest return for U.S. military dollars because there is so much room\r\nfor investment before the onset of diminishing returns. In the first place, active defenses could help protect U.S. strategic offensive\r\nweapons, hopefully destroying a portion of any Soviet attack capability launched against\r\ncounterforce targets and preserving U.S. retaliatory might. Results following a Soviet\r\nfirst strike might therefore not reflect such a gross asymmetry in favor of the U.S.S.R.\r\nas is currently contemplated. To Bernard Brodie, this point constitutes a basic principle\r\nabout defense in general: Known ability to defend our retaliatory force constitutes the only unilaterally\r\n  attainable situation that provides potentially a perfect defense of our homeland.\r\n  Conversely, a conspicuous inability or unreadiness to defend our retaliatory force must\r\n  tend to provoke the opponent to destroy it; in other words, it tempts him to an aggression\r\n  he might not otherwise contemplate. 29"

One approach might be for both sides\r\nto develop massive and highly effective defenses on a scale of both quantity and quality\r\nthat could meet and destroy any combination of nuclear attack launched against them. By\r\nusing various weapons and tactics, such defenses would reduce the effectiveness of\r\noffensive systems so drastically that a climate and a motive conducive to disarmament\r\ncould result. Such a development, however, envisions a highly optimistic evolution of\r\ndefensive versus offensive weaponry, which is historically and logically questionable. It\r\nwould be better to assume that if both offensive and defensive weaponry continue to be\r\ndeveloped, each will contain elements of strength and weakness with neither achieving\r\ntotal dominance. In such an event, defenses would contribute to deterrence only to the\r\nextent that greater uncertainty was introduced to offensive planning. Nuclear attack would\r\nbe forestalled by eliminating certainty of destruction and replacing it with less\r\nquantifiable probabilities."

      "text": "Another (more realistic) way of eliminating the specter of nuclear war would be for\r\ndefensive strategies to be employed along with negotiated arms reductions. Assuming that\r\nreductions in strategic nuclear weapons will be approved eventually by both the United\r\nStates and the Soviet Union, it is obvious that ballistic missile defense (BMD) systems\r\nwould multiply the effect of such reductions. It is generally held that the primary\r\nproblem with BMD is the sheer mass of incoming missiles that would have to be faced in a\r\nshort time. If the numbers were reduced, associated defensive solutions would be more\r\nviable. Even first-generation ABMs (Sprint/Safeguard) were touted as possessing good\r\ncapability against limited or Nth-country (China) attacks. 30 Eventually, if\r\nboth sides drew down to, say, 200 launchers, defensive weapons might begin to achieve\r\nvirtually certain protection. Furthermore, any reluctance to take the final step beyond\r\nreductions to total nuclear disarmarnent, stemming from a desire to retain at least\r\nlimited options to employ weapons of mass destruction in times of crisis, might be\r\novercome. Where without defenses there could be great misgivings about total nuclear\r\ndisarmament, if it could be shown that small offensive weapons reserves were useless in\r\nthe face of effective defenses, incentives would exist to continue the arms reduction\r\nprocess. In other words, defensive weapons would promote both a climate and a motive for\r\ndisarmament by eliminating any threat of surprise. Such prospects however, depend on the\r\ndevelopment of defensive systems on both sides before they are needed. Obviously, the\r\nsooner development can begin, the better. IN summary, then, one can see that the fundamentals of current grand strategies are\r\ndeeply rooted in past strategic theory and, in fact, represent the culmination of\r\nclassical theory in its purest form. Adistinct difference between U.S. and Soviet\r\nstrategic doctrine exists, with the United States preferring to stress the offensive while\r\nthe Soviets pursue a more balanced approach. To remove Soviet temptation to strike at\r\nvulnerable U.S. weapons and to serve as a \"multiplier\" to any arms reductions,\r\nU.S. adoption of some elements of defensive strategy and development of associated\r\nweaponry seem reasonable and worthwhile. Admittedly, there are those who claim that BMD is destabilizing. They point out that if\r\neither nation perceives the other to be gaining a technological breakthrough--deploying\r\ndefensive systems unilaterally and gaining protection that the other cannot obtain--it may\r\nfeel forced to launch a preemptive strike before such defenses could be set in place. Such\r\narguments, however, do not militate against U.S. development of BMD but only\r\nagainst the manner and timing of deploying such systems. If the United States finds itself facing a numerically superior nuclear force capable\r\nof destroying two legs of its triad (ICBMs and bombers), Soviet temptation to strike at\r\nthis area of vulnerability, as pointed out by Bernard Brodie, might provide a motive for\r\nattack. If such a Soviet force were augmented by comprehensive antimissile defenses, that\r\nmotive would be even stronger because the means of negating a substantial portion\r\nof the remaining U.S. weapons, the SLBMs, would be in hand. The United States would, in\r\neffect, face forceful cancellation of its strategic forces altogether by the offensive and\r\ndefensive combination of Soviet arms. If, on the other hand, the United States pushed ahead as rapidly as possible with\r\nresearch and development, then unilateral deployment of BMD systems by the Soviets would\r\nbe obviated by U.S. ability to deploy similar systems apace. Once both nations have\r\ndefensive systems in place, those systems will begin to produce the beneficial,\r\nstabilizing effects discussed earlier. The issue is how to get safety from here to there.\r\nClearly, however, if the United States attains the capability to deploy effective BMD\r\nweapons, then it can set the pace for mutual deployment; if it is not in a position to\r\nkeep up with the Soviets, however, the United States will be faced with the uncomfortable\r\npossibility that the Soviets may not be willing to modify or restrain their deployment\r\nschedule. In the end, however, the debate could be moot. Given the present state of research and\r\ndevelopment of various forms of BMD on both sides and the investment emphasis placed on\r\npushing those programs ahead, defensive systems for both of the superpowers could\r\nbe developed at about the same time. If the United States accepts the importance and logic\r\nof strategic defenses as the Soviets have, it might only be necessary for each nation to\r\npursue diplomatic contacts and intelligence gathering to ensure themselves that no\r\nshort-term, unilateral disadvantages developed. Regardless of the likelihood of concurrent\r\ntiming, it is clear that the United States should pursue antimissile defense as vigorously\r\nas possible, recognizing that it is the only type of strategic program still capable of\r\nmatching political goals with military aims. The inertia of U.S. preference for offensive\r\nstrategy, whether disguised as theories such as mutual assured destruction or\r\npseudoscientific investigations such as cost-benefit analysis, must be overcome.
