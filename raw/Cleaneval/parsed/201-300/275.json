      "text": "JANUARY 13TH, 2005 | ARCHIVE Hi Ijust got in from an award ceremony. We were voted The Best Scottish Band Of All Time by the readers of The List magazine. Ha ha! Imissed the bloody prizegiving, got there too late, but apparantly Stevie made a very nice acceptence speech. The Best Scottish Band Of All Time! Thats going to piss a few people off. Im going off to bed, but Ithought Id pinch a few questions off the q and as since they were quite long, and stick them here. These were ones Idid earlier Ilike it how some of you seem to be getting right down to some serious issues! Or even some not so serious ones! I'm not sure if I'm the man for the job, but I'll try my best! From Elen Hello Stuart, Ihope you're well. I'm a 15 year-old from Wales, Iregularly go to church, and once a month Iplay the organ (badly). Ionce played 4 verses of \"Morning has broken\" with the biggest hairy brown spider sat a few inches away from my lap, watching me. The thing is that even though Iconsider myself to be a christian, Ifeel more of a sense of duty to play the organ in church, rather than really feeling that Iwant to. Ido enjoy it, but maybe not for the right reasons. Igrew up in this small village and went to the local primary and Sunday school etc. So Ifeel that Ican't let the people who have steered me through my life so far down. Do you think that this is really a reason to be christian? Because my Mum says that through wanting to help and please others, Iam being christian, but Ifeel a bit disillusioned towards it personally. This is a bit of a scrappy question, but Ihope you can give an opinion on this. Thank you for you time. With Kind Regards, Elen. P.S. Do you think spiders can be religious? Or sing \"Morning has broken\"? Lets get this straight, Elen. You aint a Christian unless you believe that a man was nailed on a cross until dead. He was buried, and he rose from the dead to sit by Gods right hand in heaven, to be our guide and saviour. Thats probably a bit of a harsh thing to say to a 15 year old, but let me qualify it. The issue of how old you are is important. What did Iknow/believe when Iwas fifteen? Ibelieved in Newtonian mechanics. Ibelieved in getting out and earning money for myself. Ibelieved that Yes made the best music and that my brother was an annoying dick. Ibelived that life would get better when Imade it to the big city. No mention of God there. Ithink at that time Ieven still trailed along to bible class, but it meant little to me. (At least, Ithought it meant little to me; it means more to me now) What Im getting at is that you are allowed time to find things out for yourself. You actually have your whole life to decide whether you are a Christian or not. Meanwhile, Isuppose by wanting to help and please others you are being a decent, regular sort of person. Its good; christian with a small c. Nothing to do with a cross, just a term thats been appropriated in modern life. Going to church, playing the organ; if it makes you feel good, do it. If it bore the tits off you, dont! Itell you what though, Ithink its pretty cool. Ialso think that when youre older and you look back youll be glad you did it. Hope that helps. Take care. Natalia Marx Hi,Stuart.Yesterday, Iwas watching \"Fans Only\" for my first time and as appeared your scenes, Irealised that you ARE MY TYPE of man!!!I'm not kidding, it's serious.The way your eyes seemed mysterious and at the same time, too beautiful...and Ialso instantly fell in love with your eyebrows (Ithink they remind me that Japanese Cartoon-Dragon Ball Z, when Goku reaches Sayajin's third form;Have you ever watched it?).Unfortunately,I'm seventeen and by now, Ihave no hope.Well, these are my questions: How old are you? Are you committed or single? That's all.Kiss on your cheek ^^x Yes, Natalia, as you are seventeen, you fall into the same age category as some of my charges in the Youth Club at my church. Therefore, from me you can expect some hastily improvised Christian guidance and a bit of a sing-song. Iam more than twice your age! You would learn to make fun of my eyebrows like the rest of the kids, and soon be bored by my over serious nature and obsessions with antiquated modes of urban transport! Your letter is appreciated though; Ido wish you all the best. Ps. In answer to your other queries \r\n(a) Ididnt realise Ihad a facial similarity to Mr Ballz. \r\n(b) Iwas nearly commited once cristina ok, i feel sort of guilty; i'be been greedy with this q and a thing. i just discovered it a few days ago, and it's so cold and rainy and dismal. my yoga class was canceled, and my classical indian dance teacher (who is usually comforting and peaceful) is depressed because her father died last week. so, you're my audience/my confessor. church. i'm the prodigal daughter, but i haven't returned. i'm afraid. is god just another pipe dream? like romantic love? i'm 2 years from 30, which could be mid life, if i die at 60. i'm the unofficial godmother to the daughter of a Hindu friend of mine. i'm supposed to find a place where she can be baptized. not sure i'm the girl for this -- i can't go into a church. i listened to joan baez singing ave maria in german the other day and broke down in tears, not happy tears. i've called priests; no one will baptize her. i feel like a fraud. and yet i don't want to urge my friend and her lovely daughter away -- maybe they'll make better sense of it than i. but they seem to think i'm the one to show them. now, finally, my question how did you do it? how do you do it? going to church. i mean, did you have any feelings of ambiguity about it? so sorry to go on with my questions -- i'll understand if you have to give the others a chance. what a greedy bitch i am! How do Ido it? Ijust woke up one Sunday and wondered where the nearest Church was. Iknew there was one along the street. Itried to get in, but the service had already started. Inoticed there was another church across the street, so Iwent in there, and Inever left. Thing is, Ilook at other people; people who speak many languages, people who can skate good, people who can fix cars like they were tying there laces, people who meditate all morning, people who are in happy, fulfilled relationships and Iwonder; how do you do it? Church is just for me Isuppose. Thing is, you must be in the market for a bit of a spiritual leg-up, else you wouldnt be asking these questions. Thats how it starts. Ask away, sincerely and with an open mind, and you will be given the answer. Ido believe that. If you go looking, or even ask in prayer, youll find something out. It might be very small, but its something to go on. As for the baptism, Icant understand why nobody will do it! Its sort of scandalous! Is that a Catholic thing? Try a methodist or presbyterian church. They ought not to turn you and your friend away. Archive"
