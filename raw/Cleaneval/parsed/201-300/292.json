Coffee is an integral part  of breakfast - it has replaced beer as the staple  breakfast drink and the very sight  of a coffee pot with its heady aroma of  freshly brewed coffee makes the statement of good hospitality - enjoy."

      "text": "There are a number of coffees to impress your breakfast guests. CAPPUCCINO - 1/3 strong coffee, 1/3 steamed milk, 1/3 frothy milk. Cappuccino is so named as it  resembles  the colour of the hooded robes of the Cappuccine monks in Italy. ESPRESSO - small cup of very strong coffee. CAFFE LATTE- double espresso  topped up with  steamed milk in  a glass. CAF CON PANNA -double espresso  topped with a swirl  of whipped cream. CAF MOCHA -strong black coffee mixed with rich chocolate syrup, steamed milk topped with whipped cream & dusted with cocoa powder. note - Coffee picked in Mocha in the Yemen is rich and dark with a hint of chocolate in it's taste - hence 'mocha.' CAF FRAPPE- (iced coffee) -  chilled double espresso, whizzed with equal amounts of cold milk and two scoops of good coffee ice cream. Agood tip is to make ice cubes  out of the left over coffee. They will chill the drink without diluting it. DECAFFEINATED coffee is made from  normal beans that are so soaked as to remove about 97% of the  caffeine with only a little loss to the flavour. INSTANT COFFEE-Better  to drink this than no coffee  at all - but it's rather like settling for the  house wine in a good restaurant rather than savouring the delights of the fine wine list. With Cafebars now a fashion item in the High Street, they have developed their own slang : 'dry' - extra foam 'harmless' - skinny and no fun 'wet' - extra steamed milk 'with wings' - take away 'skinny' - fat free milk 'wild' - whipped cream 'no fun' - decaffeinated 'no whip' - no whipped cream"

      "text": "Start by visiting your coffee  specialist store. Explain  just how you  like your  coffee, mild,  strong, rich,  toasted, full bodied, (you see it really is as  exciting as choosing that special bottle of wine). Then  explain by what method you  make the coffee. These are  important facts.  For example  breakfast is  best served by a blend  of the  strong  rich  coffees from  Africa blended with the milder but fuller bodied coffee from central America or try a good  cinnamon roasted coffee \nfor breakfast. Now  with the  coffee at  home, only  grind enough  beans for  immediate  use.  Ground  beans  can  be  helped  by keeping in the refrigerator  in an  air tight  container to  prevent the  oil and volatile  gases  escaping.  Try  to  use  pure  water.  Bottled or purified in a Britta jug is best. For white coffee you should use a little cream  or full  fat milk.  Semi- skimmed  only dilutes  the coffee. Never use UHT  or synthetic 'creamer' - just try  it on it's own ! If  you wish  to sweeten  the brew,  use raw or rough brown sugar, white sugar  will spoil some of  the flavour. Try to  drink coffee without sugar rather than add sweeteners. There are three main ways to make coffee. Firstly the basic jug or\ncafetiere where you add the water ((just off the boil) to a jug of freshly  ground coffee.  The second  is the  filter or drip method where the hot water filters and drips through a funnel filled with ground coffee. The third is the well known percolater."
