      "text": "Top =======  Understanding\r\nHinduism  ======= The following text is reproduced from our Page ' Empty Chamber ' Science of Speech From The Mahabharata Santi Parva, Section CCCXXI Translated by Sri Kisari Mohan Ganguli An extract from the dialogue between King Janaka, the ruler of the Videha and a woman\r\nof the name of Sulabha, belonging to the mendicant order. Sulabha said: O king, speech ought always to be free from the nine verbal faults and\r\nthe nine faults of judgment. It should also, while setting forth the meaning with\r\nperspicuity, be possessed of the eighteen well-known merits. Ambiguity, ascertainment of the faults and merits of premises and conclusions, the\r\nconclusion, and the element of persuasiveness or otherwise that attaches to the conclusion\r\nthus arrived at- these five characteristics appertaining to the sense- constitute the\r\nauthoritativeness of what is said. Listen now o the characteristics of these requirements\r\nbeginning with ambiguity, one after another, as I expound them according to the\r\ncombinations. When knowledge rests on distinction in consequence of the object to be known being\r\ndifferent from one another, and when (as regards the comprehension of the subject) the\r\nunderstanding rests upon many points, one after another, the combination of words (in\r\nwhose case this occurs) is said to be vitiated by ambiguity. By ascertainment (of faults\r\nand merits), called Sankhya, is meant the establishment, by elimination, of faults or\r\nmerits (in premises and conclusions), adopting tentative meanings. Krama or weighing the\r\nrelative strength or weakness of the faults or merits (ascertained by the above process)\r\nconsists in settling the propriety of the priority or subsequence of the words employed in\r\na sentence. This is the meaning attached to the word ‘Krama’ by persons\r\nconversant with the interpretation of sentences or texts. By conclusion is meant the final\r\ndetermination, after this examination of what has been said on the subjects of religion,\r\npleasure, wealth, and Emancipation, in respect of what is particularly is that has been\r\nsaid in the text. The sorrow born of wish or aversion increases to a great measure. The\r\nconduct, O king, that one pursues in such a matter (for dispelling the sorrow experienced)\r\nis called Prayojanam. [Note: By ‘prayojanam’ is meant the conduct one pursues for gratifying\r\none’s wish to acquire or avoid any object. Wish in respect of either acquisition or\r\navoidance, if ungratified, becomes a source of pain. The section or conduct that one\r\nadopts for removing that pain is called Prayojanam. In the Gautama-sutras it is said that\r\n‘yamarthamadhikritya pravartate, tat prayojanam.’ The two definitions are\r\nidentical.] Take it for certain, O king, at my word, that these characteristics of Ambiguity and\r\nthe other (numbering five in all), when occurring together, constitute a complete and\r\nintelligible sentence. [Note: By occurrence of these five characteristics together is meant that when these\r\nare properly attended to by a speaker or writer, only then can his sentence be said to be\r\ncomplete and intelligible. In Nyaya, the five requisites are Pratijna, Hetu, Udaharana,\r\nUpanaya, and Nigamana. In the Mimansa philosophy, the five requisites have been named\r\ndifferently. Vishaya, Samsaya, Purvapaksha, Uttara, and Nirnaya.] The words I shall utter will be fraught with sense, free from ambiguity (in consequence\r\nof each of them not being symbols of many things), logical, free from pleonasm or\r\ntautology, smooth, certain, free from bombast, agreeable or sweet, truthful, inconsistent\r\nwith the aggregate of three, (viz., Righteousness, Wealth, and Pleasure), refined (i.e.,\r\nfree from Prakriti), not elliptical or imperfect, destitute of harshness or difficulty of\r\ncomprehension, characterized by due order, not far fetched in respect of sense, corrected\r\nwith one another as cause and effect and each having a specific object. [Note: These characteristics, though numbering sixteen, include the four and twenty\r\nmentioned by Bhojadeva in his Rhetoric called ‘Saraswati-kanthabharana.] I shall not tell thee anything, prompted by desire or wrath or fear or cupidity or\r\nabjectness or deceit or shame or compassion or pride. (I answer thee because it is proper\r\nfor me to answer what thou hast said). When the speaker, the hearer, and the words said,\r\nthoroughly agree with one another in course of a speech, then does the sense or meaning\r\ncome out very clearly. When, in the matter of what is to be said, the speaker shows\r\ndisregard for the understanding of the hearer by uttering words whose meaning is\r\nunderstood by himself, then, however good those words may be, they become incapable of\r\nbeing seized by the hearer. That speaker, again, who, abandoning all regard for his own meaning uses words that are\r\nof excellent sound and sense, awakens only erroneous impressions in the mind of the\r\nhearer. Such words in such connection become certainly faulty. That speaker, however, who\r\nemploys words that are, while expressing his own meaning, intelligible to the hearer, as\r\nwell, truly deserves to be called a speaker. No other man deserves the name. It behoveth\r\nthee, therefore, O king, to hear with concentrated attention these words of mine, fraught\r\nwith meaning and endued with wealth of vocables. =================================== Related articles: Empty Chamber Abusive Speech Hanuman (Hanuman's speech as assessed by Sri Ram) Top <To top of this page Index Alphabetical [Index to Pages] webbot bot=\"Navigation\" S-Type=\"arrows\" S-Orientation=\"horizontal\" S-Rendering=\"graphics\" B-Include-Home=\"TRUE\" B-Include-Up=\"FALSE\" startspan webbot bot=\"Navigation\" endspan i-checksum=\"57945\""
