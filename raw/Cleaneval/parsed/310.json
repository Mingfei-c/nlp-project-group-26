      "text": "Why Choose Art and Design at Carmel? In our everyday life we are surrounded by visual imagery, which shapes our experiences and thinking, ranging from advertising and film to music, architecture and fashion. By studying one or two specialist areas in the department, you can make a valuable contribution to the visual world. We offer a wide variety of specialist AS and A2 levels, where it is possible to explore media and techniques in an imaginative and exciting way.  You have the opportunity to be taught by specialist and well-qualified tutors, with enviable pass rates, who will support you through your time at the college. Although examinations are important, and hard work and commitment are essential to achieving your artistic aims, a great sense of satisfaction, enjoyment and fulfilment can be achieved by expressing your ideas confidently in the scale or medium you choose.  We, as tutors, are concerned with working with individual students to maximise their potential."
