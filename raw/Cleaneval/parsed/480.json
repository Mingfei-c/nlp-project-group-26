In the case of\n        at least one of these trades -- which has left a $2.5\n        million prize unclaimed -- the firm used to place the\n        “put options” on United Airlines stock was,\n        until 1998, managed by the man who is now in the number\n        three Executive Director position at the Central\n        Intelligence Agency. Until 1997 A.B.\n        “Buzzy” Krongard had been Chairman of the\n        investment bank A.B. Brown. A.B. Brown was acquired by\n        Banker’s Trust in 1997. Krongard then became, as\n        part of the merger, Vice Chairman of Banker’s\n        Trust-AB Brown, one of 20 major U.S. banks named by\n        Senator Carl Levin this year as being connected to money\n        laundering. Krongard’s last position at\n        Banker’s Trust (BT) was to oversee “private\n        client relations.” In this capacity he had direct\n        hands-on relations with some of the wealthiest people in\n        the world in a kind of specialized banking operation that\n        has been identified by the U.S. Senate and other\n        investigators as being closely connected to the\n        laundering of drug money."

The suspension\n                of trading for four days after the attacks made\n                it impossible to cash-out quickly and claim the\n                prize before investigators started looking. “…\n                October series options for UAL Corp. were\n                purchased in highly unusual volumes three trading\n                days before the terrorist attacks for a total\n                outlay of $2,070; investors bought the option\n                contracts, each representing 100 shares, for 90\n                cents each. [This represents 230,000 shares]. Those options are now selling at more than $12\n                each. There are still 2,313 so-called\n                “put” options outstanding [valued\n                at $2.77 million and representing 231,300 shares] according to the Options Clearinghouse\n                Corp.” “…The\n                source familiar with the United trades identified\n                Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, the American\n                investment banking arm of German giant Deutsche\n                Bank, as the investment bank used to purchase at\n                least some of these options…” This\n                was the operation managed by Krongard until as\n                recently as 1998. As reported\n                in other news stories, Deutsche Bank was also the\n                hub of insider trading activity connected to\n                Munich Re. just before the attacks. CIA, THE\n                BANKS AND THE BROKERS Understanding\n                the interrelationships between CIA and the\n                banking and brokerage world is critical to\n                grasping the already frightening implications of\n                the above revelations. Let’s look at the\n                history of CIA, Wall Street and the big banks by\n                looking at some of the key players in CIA’s\n                history. Clark\n                Clifford – The National Security Act of\n                1947 was written by Clark Clifford, a Democratic\n                Party powerhouse, former Secretary of Defense,\n                and one-time advisor to President Harry Truman.\n                In the 1980s, as Chairman of First American\n                Bancshares, Clifford was instrumental in getting\n                the corrupt CIA drug bank BCCI a license to\n                operate on American shores. His profession: Wall\n                Street lawyer and banker. John\n                Foster and Allen Dulles – These two\n                brothers “designed” the CIA for\n                Clifford. Both were active in intelligence\n                operations during WW II. Allen Dulles was the\n                U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland where he met\n                frequently with Nazi leaders and looked after\n                U.S. investments in Germany. John Foster went on\n                to become Secretary of State under Dwight\n                Eisenhower and Allen went on to serve as CIA\n                Director under Eisenhower and was later fired by\n                JFK. Their professions: partners in the most\n                powerful - to this day - Wall Street law firm of\n                Sullivan, Cromwell. Bill Casey – Ronald Reagan’s CIA Director and OSS\n                veteran who served as chief wrangler during the\n                Iran-Contra years was, under President Richard\n                Nixon, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange\n                Commission. His profession: Wall Street lawyer\n                and stockbroker. David\n                Doherty - The current Vice President of the\n                New York Stock Exchange for enforcement is the\n                retired General Counsel of the Central\n                Intelligence Agency. George\n                Herbert Walker Bush – President from\n                1989 to January 1993, also served as CIA Director\n                for 13 months from 1976-7. He is now a paid\n                consultant to the Carlyle Group, the 11 th largest defense contractor in the nation, which\n                also shares joint investments with the bin Laden\n                family. A.B.\n                “Buzzy” Krongard – The current\n                Executive Director of the Central Intelligence\n                Agency is the former Chairman of the investment\n                bank A.B. Brown and former Vice Chairman of\n                Banker’s Trust. John\n                Deutch - This retired CIA Director from the\n                Clinton Administration currently sits on the\n                board at Citigroup, the nation’s second\n                largest bank, which has been repeatedly and\n                overtly involved in the documented laundering of\n                drug money. This includes Citigroup’s 2001\n                purchase of a Mexican bank known to launder drug\n                money, Banamex. Nora\n                Slatkin – This retired CIA Executive\n                Director also sits on Citibank’s board. Maurice\n                “Hank” Greenburg – The CEO of\n                AIG insurance, manager of the third largest\n                capital investment pool in the world, was floated\n                as a possible CIA Director in 1995. FTW exposed Greenberg’s and AIG’s long\n                connection to CIA drug trafficking and covert\n                operations in a two-part series that was\n                interrupted just prior to the attacks of\n                September 11. AIG’s stock has bounced back\n                remarkably well since the attacks. To read that\n                story, please go to http://www.copvcia.com/stories/part_2.html . One wonders\n                how much damning evidence is necessary to respond\n                to what is now irrefutable proof that CIA knew\n                about the attacks and did not stop them. Whatever\n                our government is doing, whatever the CIA is\n                doing, it is clearly NOT in the interests of the\n                American people, especially those who died on\n                September 11.
