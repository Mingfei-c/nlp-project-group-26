      "text": "Left Col, Essay Body The conflict in Northern Ireland is likely one of the most closely watched and\nhotly debated disputes of our time.  Spanning now for over a century, what\nremains at the root of the conflict is unclear.  Many theories have developed\nover time, yet no one theory seems to adequately describe the complex struggle. \nThe conflict has been divided down many lines; ethnically between the British\nand the Irish, geographically, between the North and the South of Ireland, and\nreligiously between Protestants and Catholics.  Theories that have emerged have\npointed to causes such as land claims and a nationalist ideology, ethnicity and\nculture, and perhaps most frequently, religion when attempting to define the\nconflict.  In fact, what is more likely is that elements of all of these issues\nlie at the root of what is commonly referred to as \"The Troubles\".\nThe history of this contemporary conflict is detailed, but impossible to ignore.\nWhile different factions of the dispute would argue that the problem began\ncenturies ago, I will examine briefly the history of the \"troubles\" from the end\nof the 19th century forward.  For much of its history, Ireland has lived under\nBritish rule.   As the 19th century drew to a close, Britain became aware of a\nrapidly growing sense of Irish Nationalism.  In 1870, the Irish Protestants\nplaced the notion of Home Rule on the front burner in an attempt to separate\nIreland from the rapid secularism that was occurring in Britain.  Very quickly\nthe movement was picked up by Irish Catholics who saw Home Rule as a truly\nnationalist ideal, and by 1874 they had dominated the movement.  This pushed the\nProtestants back towards Unionism and was one of the many strikes against the\nidea of a united Ireland."

      "text": "Feeling tremendous pressure to grant Ireland Home Rule, Britain began to talk\nabout making efforts to \"pacify\" Ireland, implying that it would indeed grant\ntheir wish.  Talks of Home Rule were then delayed.  The Irish saw the delay as a\nfurther political tactic of a British parliament who had no intention of\ngranting them autonomy.  The British struggled with the question of who would\nrun this complex society that was so heavily rooted in imperialistic tradition,\nand who at best had a shaky industrial and political structure.  This delay\nfurther divided Irish nationalists.  New radical forms of nationalism emerged,\nsuch as the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Sinn Fein, whose leaders were\nwilling to use violent means if necessary to secure Irish independence.\nA further divide between Protestants and Catholics also developed at this time,\nparticularly in the northern province of Ulster.  Unionists groups, who were\nProtestant by religion and British by tradition, were opposed to Home Rule\nbecause they believed that Ireland should maintain her ties to Britain.  In an\neffort to resist the Home Rule movement, they began to organize.  They created a\nProvisional Government of Ulster, complete with a constitution and raised an\narmy to defend it.  Further to that, in 1912 they created what was called the\n`Solemn League and Covenant' which bound their followers to use any means\nnecessary to resist Home Rule.  They gathered over a half a million signatures,\nsome of the Unionists even signing in their own blood. The debate over Home Rule was put on hold when World War I broke out.  The\nDublin Easter Rising of 1916 served as a reminder to the British that the\nquestion of Ireland's independence would need to be answered when the war was\nover.  Over 220 people were killed and over 600 more injured when Irish\nRepublican Brotherhood rebels took hold of Dublin.  The British, outnumbering\nthe rebels 20 to 1, eventually took back the city six days later.  In the face\nof what could have been a political victory for the British, they made the error\nof executing the surviving Irish rebels, martyring them and instilling anger and\ndetermination in the minds of many Irish Nationalists. The dilemma of Home Rule as the British saw it was how to given the Irish\nCatholics what they wanted while still providing for the Irish Protestants of\nUlster.  Their answer was the Government of Ireland Act of 1920, which created\ntwo separate parliaments, one in the North and one in the South.  These\nparliaments were charged with their own domestic affairs, but all foreign\naffairs and income tax collection remained in the hands of the British.\nFurther resistance and guerilla warfare eventually led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty\nof 1921, which outlined the creation of the Irish Free State, now known as the\nRepublic of Ireland.  It was made up of the provinces of Munster, Leinster and\nConnaught, as well as three of the nine counties of Ulster - Donegal, Monaghan,\nand Cavan.    Northern Ireland, now a legal entity made of up the six remaining\ncounties of Ulster - Fermanagh, Armagh, Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim and Down -\nremained under British rule.   The division created an almost entirely Catholic\npopulation in the South of Ireland and a substantial Protestant majority in the\nNorth. The partitioning of Ireland was viewed by the South as a temporarily solution to\nthe `Protestant' problem in the North.  They maintained that not an inch of\nIrish land would be given up to the British.  In 1937, the creation of the Irish\nConstitution in the South laid claim to the six counties that remained under\nBritish rule and acknowledged that they were being held temporarily and\nillegally. Population divisions had always existed in the two major cities of what was now\nNorthern Ireland.  Belfast, the largest city and center of economic activity had\na largely Protestant population, where as Derry, a key center for the shipping\nindustry had a largely Catholic population.  Both cities also boasted a\nconcentrated minority group, yet conflict was not always inherent, as the\nminority did not pose a threat to the majority's way of life.  With the rise of\nindustrialization, there was a rapid migration of people to Belfast,\npredominantly in search of work and housing.  The majority of the people\nmigrating were Catholic, which began to present a problem for the Protestant\ncommunity.  Not only were they competing for housing and employment, but the\npercentage of Catholics in Belfast was not only rising, but they were beginning\nto organize.  As they learned how to use political institutions to wield\ninfluence, the Protestants became more resentful of their presence.  To the\nCatholics, their eventual control over Belfast was inevitable.  As Bernard\nHughes, the only Roman Catholic representative on the Belfast City Council in\n1857 stated, \"This town (Belfast) is governed by Protestants, but the bone and\nsinew of the town is Roman Catholic.\"(Brewer & Higgins 1998). What was born was\na conflict between the working class members of society, while the middle and\nupper classes struggled to maintain peaceful control.  The peace was not to\nlast. The decades to follow would be wrought with violence.  Battles would be waged\nbetween the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Ulster Defense Association and\nBritish paramilitaries.  Thousands of innocent people would be killed in bomb\nblasts, riots and sectarian killings.  Even law abiding citizens lend support to\nthese groups, because the battle for the \"Cause\" on either side is paramount. \nWhat is it that turns these common citizens into killing machines?  What\nprevents any kind of peace agreements from taking hold in this conflict ridden\nnation?  The answer is perhaps more complicated than the conflict.\nTheorists have struggled over a solution to \"the Troubles\" in Northern Ireland\nfor a number of years.  Yet in seeking this solution, few have truly gotten\ninside the conflict.  Northern Ireland's battle has produced not only an\nenormous human cost but also a unique population that has been raised in\nviolence.  Understanding that population is key to any sort of peace agreement. \nThat understanding lies in examining what motivates both sides of the conflict.\nThe battle over land is one of the most common sources of conflict in history. \nIt is not surprising then that it plays a role in this conflict.  To the Irish,\ntheir identity was rooted in the Church and the Land.  British imperialism saw\nthe implementation of land lordship in Ireland.  Protestant landlords rented\nland to Catholic tenants, turning an economic system into one wrought with deep\nreligious animosity.  This represented not only conquest but religious\npersecution to the Irish. (Hickey 1984)\nThe Famine of 1845-1849 was a significant set back in Anglo-Irish relations.  It\nrepresented a failure of the British government to provide for the basic needs\nof the Irish.  It was also seen by some as an attempt to pacify the Irish\nthrough starvation.  The relief offered to Catholics during the famine also\nfurthered the divide between Protestants and Catholics, as it was often offered\non the condition that they attend a Protestant church.   It was becoming clear\nto Irish Catholics that the root of their hardship lay with the British and\nIrish nationalism gained momentum. Another one of the theories that have been presented is that the conflict is\nrooted in ethnic or cultural difference.  The obvious critique to this idea is\nthat the Protestant and the Catholic groups have one major thing in common -\nthey are all Irish.  Yet, these two groups would tend to differ in that belief.\nThe label Protestant has come to signify the Irish of the North that identify\nthemselves with British tradition.  They pledge allegiance to the British Crown\nand fight to maintain ties to Britain.  Despite the fact that they were likely\nborn in Ireland, they tend to associate themselves with being British.  They are\nalso referred to as Unionists, Loyalists or Orangemen.  On the flip side of that\nare the Catholics.  The population that falls under this label is considered\nethnically Irish.  They fight for a united Ireland, free from British rule. \nThey attempt to maintain the Irish language of Gaelic, and although there are\nfew places left that use it pre-dominantly, it is still taught in Roman Catholic\nschools.  These people are often referred to as Nationalists or Republicans.\nThe Irish argument then is that there is a distinctly `Irish' culture that is\nbeing stifled by a `British' majority in Northern Ireland.  The two keys\nelements of the `Irish' culture that make co-existence near impossible are that\nit is rooted in a nationalist ideology and that Catholic beliefs are intertwined\nwith that ideology.  Their belief is that harmony can only exist when all of\nIreland is united and the assimilation of the non-Irish is complete.\nThe major problem with this plan is two-fold.  Firstly, Protestants have a\nculture which they believe in and defend and do not wish to sacrifice. \nSecondly, Northern Ireland has existed as an independent state for over 80\nyears, and has likely developed a kind of culture that is unique and that may\nnot blend well with the culture of the Republic of Ireland. Religion seems to be the element that ties many of the theories on the conflict\ntogether.  Under the above pretense, the labels Catholic and Protestant are used\nto convey cultural and political connotations.  Yet religion remains an integral\npart of ones culture.  In the battle over land, religion maintains its tie\nthrough the battle between Protestant landlords and Catholic tenants.  Religion\neven has political links, as many nationalists, such as D.P. Morgan, the founder\nof the Leader newspaper, believe that the two ideas are inseparable: \"When we look out on Ireland we see that those who believe, or may be immediately induced to believe, in Ireland as a nation are, as a matter of fact, Catholics... If a non-Catholic nationalist Irishman does not wish to live in a Catholic atmosphere let him turn Orangeman.\" (Hickey 1984) It is important then to look seriously at the role that religion plays in the\nconflict in Northern Ireland. There are two sides to the religion debate.  One the one hand, some believe that\nthe labels Protestant and Catholic are just that - labels used to define two\nwarring factions of the conflict in the absence of a real ethnic divide.  Given\nthat one can point to ideas of territorial dispute, nationalism and culture as\npotential sources of conflict, it is easy to see where this opinion is formed.\nYet when examined more closely, there is merit in the argument that there are\ndogmatic differences in the two religions which keep the conflict at a\nstalemate.  While both Protestantism and Catholicism are forms of Christianity,\nthe beliefs surrounding how society should be structured can lead to political\nconflict. Catholicism is a very closely knit religion.  One of the key elements of the\nbelief is in the emphasis placed on prayer and sacraments.  The individual who\nadministers these sacraments becomes of the utmost importance, which results in\nthe creation of the priesthood.  This suggests a social order where the leaders\nhave significant control over the systems of a society. Protestantism in contrast is based much more loosely.  It is composed of several\nforms of Christianity, including Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist and\nthe Church of Ireland.  The appeal is much more direct - one where the minister\nprepares parishioners to meet God directly.   This poses a direct threat to the\nstructured organization of the Roman Catholic faith.  Likewise, Protestants fear\nthat if Ireland is united, their faith will be consumed by Catholicism.\nUltimately, the result is that the religious divide between these two groups is\nnot merely in symbolic membership, but also in the interpretation of the\nChristian faith.  As indicated by Professor John Hickey, \"it is more a question\nof religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion.\" (Hickey\n1984) Religion is often downplayed as a cause of the conflict in Northern\nIreland because Western pluralistic societies do not place as much emphasis on\nthe importance of religion in daily life. The question then becomes how does one find a solution to a conflict that\nis so multifaceted?  Belfast child psychologist Morris Frazer indicates\nthat what Northern Ireland is now faced with is \"a generation of children\nwho have lived with fear, have been taught to hate and who now aspire to\nkill.\" (Morrissey and Smyth 2002).  Here in lies the starting point to\nresolution - education.  It has become clear that in order to implement\na peace agreement between Protestants and Catholics, and to make positive\nprogress towards a bi-national state, a bottom-up approach must be used. There are a few key things that must be taken into consideration by all sides. \nThe first is that violence is not now, nor will it ever be, a successful\nbargaining tool.  Further to that is the idea that a peace agreement cannot end\nat the absence of direct violence.  Progress must be made towards a model of\npositive peace.  In order to achieve this, negotiations must consider the\npositions of the minority - Catholics in Northern Ireland and Protestants in\nIreland as a whole.  No one groups' rights can be infringed upon.  This would\nlead almost naturally to the idea of a bi-national state.  Coexistence is the\nbest chance that Ireland has at unification.  It is the only real way to obtain\npositive peace and a stable infrastructure. Peace Process Bombings, shootings and countless other acts.  Will the violence ever end?\nWill peace and stability ever come?   These were the questions that\nfor most of Northern Irelands history best described prospects for a\nsolution. For generations unionist and nationalist communities had been\nseparated as well as isolated from each other, turning to demonstrations\nof community strength to meeting with each other in negotiation and\ncooperation.  For the most part, the earliest attempts at peace attempted\nto make only mechanical political solutions.  These only reinforced\nthe already opposing relationships.  Relative calm followed the Ireland\nAct of 1949, which created the Republic of Ireland in the south. By the\n1950s, even Catholics in the North, still securely tethered to Britain,\nseemed ready to accept equality rather than pushing for securing a more\nunited Ireland, scholars note. But that changed after Northern Ireland's\nCatholics organized a large demonstration protesting discrimination\nin voting rights, housing and unemployment in 1968. A police crackdown\nfollowed, sparking months of violence and a reemergence of the Republican\nmovement. The subsequent bloody riots between Protestants and Catholics\nmarked the beginning of The Troubles, the euphemism for the period of\nviolence that would continue for years in Northern Ireland. Both the Irish Republican and British sides experienced breakthroughs in the\n1980s that would help to prepare the ground for the peace process.  The\npropaganda campaign around the hunger strikes started the Sinn Fein involvement\nin electoral politics and community action.  It was this event that started a\ntransformation.  This was the beginning of Sinn Fein's ascendancy over the IRA. \nThis was the beginning of a shift in emphasis from a military strategy to a\nprimarily political one, and a lowering margin of victory on which the\nRepublican outlook was focused, from the absolute principle of the right of the\nIrish people as a whole to self-determination towards ensuring that the\nimmediate interests of their core base of support were sufficiently represented\nin and by British state institutions.  This move into party politics would end\nup leading Sinn Fein to end their commitment to not take their seats in the\nDail, a commitment which had been a key principle for Republicans since as far\nback as the 1920s.  In taking their seats in the Irish Parliament and later in\nlocal councils in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein was explicitly recognizing\ninstitutions set up under partition and thus implicitly recognizing the\npartition of the country itself. When Republicans did engage in a peace process contacts like nationalist John\nHume were to be important.  With the additional support from sections of\nIrish-America this cooperation with 'constitutional' nationalism became the\npan-nationalist alliance.  This connection acted as the go through which\nRepublicans were able to ease their movement from a confrontational approach to\na placatory one.  The role of intermediaries was to become very important in the\npeace process.  During the late 1980s contacts were made and a network of\nconnections developed.  But at this stage the contacts were largely secret and\nunfruitful, a reflection of both the pariah status of Republicans and the\ndistance between their stance and that of other political actors\nIt was not until these existing relationships were challenged, most crucially in\nthe Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and subsequently in several other initiatives\njointly determined by the British and Irish governments, that the main parties\nbegan to participate in efforts to create a democratic peace.  The search for\npeace had always been overwhelmed by the violence that reinforced separation. \nThe British government's negotiation and signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement\nwith the government of the Republic of Ireland in 1985 marked some developments\nthat were to be important for the peace process.  The Agreement brought the\nBritish government closer with the government of the Republic of Ireland.  This\nwas also significant for moving away from viewing Northern Ireland as a purely\ndomestic matter for the British government.  The introduction and maintenance of\nthe Agreement was achieved against the express wishes of Ulster unionists.  This\nwas an indication of the declining power of the Unionists in Northern Ireland. \nUnlike the Power-sharing Assembly of 1974, Unionists failed in their attempts to\nwreck the Agreement.  Such a failure also indicated that the British government\nwas prepared to face down Unionist opposition. The current peace process began in April 1993 when John Hume, leader of the\nSDLP, and Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, met to discuss the future of\nNorthern Ireland.  An idea of determination for the people of Ireland was a\nmajor priority.  And they hoped these discussions would lead to a historical\nagreement between the British and Irish governments.  A key element of this\ndiscussion was that Britain should be willing to allow the people of Ireland to\ndecide their own political future.  This meant that they had to accept the\npossibility of a united Ireland.  Furthermore, they were to call on Britain to\ndeclare it had no selfish, political, strategic, or economic interest in\nNorthern Ireland. SF in past years had shown some signs that they wished to peacefully and\ndemocratically reach a political settlement in Northern Ireland.  Through their\ncoming together, Hume and Adams signaled a change in the Nationalists approach\nto the Northern Irish situation which would, eventually, entail Republicans\nbeing willing to abandon violence.  In this approach, Nationalist leaders hoped\nto appeal to a much larger percentage of the nationalist community and to the\nIrish people of the Republic.  Violence had reduced support for the Nationalist\ncause in the Republic of Ireland.  The task of SF would be to convince the IRA\nthat they could achieve their political aims without the use of paramilitary\nforce. The discussions between Hume and Adams would be the driving factor to talks\nbetween the British and Irish governments.  In June 1993 both governments came\ntogether to discuss the future of each governments relationship to Northern\nIreland.  For six months, both governments would try to reach a compromise.  The\nmain debate focused on the question of self-determination.  In the end the\nBritish government could not accept self-determination for the people of Ireland\nas a whole.  On 15 December 1993 the Joint Declaration on Peace was released. \nTo Republicans, the declaration was not seen as a solution to the conflict\nbetween the two communities.  The document claimed to create a structure in\nwhich a peaceful political settlement could come about. Both British and Irish governments knew that no democratic process could be\ninfluenced by violence.  It was also known that if the talks were to produce any\nlasting settlement the process would have to be as inclusive as possible. The\nabsence of political parties that represented the various paramilitary groups\nwas seen as a drawback to the possibility of a permanent settlement. Therefore,\nit was considered essential that Loyalist and Republican paramilitary groups\nshould be encouraged to enter into cease-fires. While politicians had struck a compromise, paramilitary groups had not.\nRepublicans spent some time seeking clarification on the Joint Agreement. Only\nwhen they felt the agreement would allow them to pursue their objectives\npolitically would they consider a cease-fire. Loyalist violence was a response\nto Republican violence, but it was also a sign of their insecurity regarding\ntheir relationship with the British government. Although unionists were in the\nmajority in Northern Ireland and the document would only allow a united Ireland\nto be achieved by majority consent from the Northern Ireland population,\nunionists no longer felt they help the power. The SF put a lot of effort into the process that eventually was to bring about\nan IRA cease-fire.  SF was convinced that the IRA's objectives could be achieved\nbetter through democratic means.  The SF argument clearly influenced the leaders\nof the IRA. On 31 August 1994 the IRA announced their cease-fire.  Though it was\na victory for peace, it was not an all-inclusive Republican cease-fire.  There\nwere other less known groups such as the Irish National Liberation Army and\nRepublican Sinn Fein that did not consider themselves bound by the IRA's\ncease-fire.  A long and violent six weeks had past before the CLMC announced a\ncease-fire of their own. In 1995 both governments introduced a new Framework for Agreement. Peace in\nNorthern Ireland helped the British and Irish governments find a new confidence\nin their dialogue. Not only was the document a continuation of issues discussed\nin The Joint Declaration for Peace, it also introduced new ideas for future\ngovernmental structures.  Not everybody in the nationalist community rejected\nthe framework.  Some believed the agreement would be beneficial for the common\ngood, the proposed structures had the potential to benefit both communities\neconomically.  However, the unionists did not see it in the same way.  They felt\nthreatened and betrayed by the document, particularly by the proposed\nNorth/South structures.  In their opinion, a North/South institution with any\nkind of political power was a sure sign of a step towards Irish unity.\nThe decommissioning of paramilitary arms became an important issue as Northern\nIreland moved towards multi-party talks.  It became apparent that some of the\nparticipants would only accept those parties, who were linked to paramilitary\norganizations, into a talk's process if weapons were first handed over. \nOpposing parties saw this not only as unrealistic but also as an unfair\nprecondition on the entry to talks.  Despite the Mitchell report, the British\ndecided a separate committee should be formed on the question of decommissions. \nThis didn't go over well with Sinn Fein or the IRA.  On February 9th, the IRA\nended their cease-fire.  The process was to go on. Talks opened June 1996. The UDP and PUP were allowed to remain in talks because\nthe CLMC Cease-fire had held under difficult circumstances.  As expected, SF was\nnot allowed to enter the talks because the IRA had not resumed its cease-fire\nbefore the talks began.  It would stay without Sinn Fein and be overshadowed by\nIRA violence most of the time.  As September 1997 grew closer, and SF recognized\nthe British government's desire to include them in the talks or else proceed\nwithout them, the Republican movement reassessed its political situation.  John\nHume argued that a resumption of the cease-fire was once again within reach of\nthe government.  On July 18th Hume and Adams released a joint statement that\nsaid lasting commitment would only be achieved if it is based on principles of\ndemocracy and equality and has the allegiance of both traditions.   Two days\nlater, the IRA resumed its cease-fire.  Both governments reacted with reserved\nhope and waited to see if the cease-fire was genuine. If it were clear the IRA\nhad abandoned all paramilitary activity for six weeks, then SF would be allowed\nto enter the talks in September. The cease-fire held, SF was admitted into the\ntalks, and not surprisingly, their arrival marked the departure of the DUP and\nUKUP. After a sincere effort by both governments to make the multi-party talks\nall inclusive, the talks still lacked representation from all parties.\nViolence had a direct impact on multi-party talks as the early months of 1998\nbrought the suspension of two parties from the process.  The UDP and SF, after\nboth governments concluded that they had breached the Mitchell principles. The\nUDP is considered as the political wing of the paramilitary group the UDA / UFF\nwhich had been linked to many killings.  It was made clear that they would be\nallowed back into the talks after a period of time if they remained committed to\nthe Mitchell principles. In late February 1998, SF was also suspended from the\ntalks.  Both governments believed those two killings, that of a Loyalist\nparamilitary and a Catholic drug dealer, was the work of the IRA. As the talks\nwere nearing the May 1998 deadline, the two governments set an exclusion of two\nweeks provided there were no further breaches of the Mitchell principles. A\nlittle less than a month after the UDP walked out of the talks, they rejoined\nthem on 23 February 1998. Despite Unionist claims that the IRA was linked to\nrecent bombings, SF also were allowed back in the talks on 23 March 1998.\nIn an effort to overcome the political gridlock, the independent chairman of the\nmulti-party talks set a deadline for agreement as the 9 April 1998.  The\ndeadline did give the process a new sense of urgency and had been a good idea. \nDuring the last week of March and the first week of April serious problems still\nlay in the path of a political.  Not surprisingly, Unionists and Nationalists\nwere divided over how power would be shared in the proposed Northern Ireland\nAssembly, and the extent to which the Irish government would have influence over\nNorthern Ireland under the proposed North-South structures. In retrospect, the tensions that were apparent between the various groupings\nwere an indication of the historical compromise that was being asked of all\nsides. The midnight deadline, of 9 April 1998, was not achieved but parties and\ngovernments stayed at the Stormont castle until an agreement was reached. The\nimminent arrival of the Easter weekend, and the prospect of a collapse of the\ntalks, gave the process and participants a last push.   The news of the\nAgreement was reported in the late afternoon on Good Friday. Amazingly all the\nparties involved in the talks attended the final session in which George\nMitchell announced that an agreement had been reached and that the multi-party\ntalks were at end.  Those involved in the process were careful not to claim it\nas a victory for any particular party, but rather as the best agreement that\ncould be achieved in the circumstances. Is this a complicated process?  It most definitely is, but it is not impossible.\nSome people feared that these events would derail the peace process. Others were\ndetermined not to let that happen. After the 1998 Omagh bombing incident, a\nspokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, What the last few days\nactually have shown is that the Agreement and the peace process have survived\nand have emerged strengthened from the process. It is unclear yet whether this sentiment is true, or is merely wishful thinking.\nIn the past, there have been agreements reached that subsequently fell apart.\nWill this one be different? Maintaining this agreement will require tremendous\nwillpower on both sides. People who have traditionally resolved disputes through\nthe use of guns and bombs will have to learn the art of compromise. On the day\nthe agreement was reached, President Clinton said: \"All friends of Ireland and Northern Ireland know the task of making the peace\nendure will be difficult. The path of peace is never easy. But the parties have\nmade brave decisions. They have chosen hope over hate, the promise of the future\nover the poison of the past. And in so doing, already they have written a new\nchapter in the rich history of their island -- a chapter of resolute courage\nthat inspires us all.\" It seems clear that the majority of people are ready to undertake this challenge\nin return for a peaceful existence. Will their leaders be able to follow their\nwishes? Only time will tell. Bibliography Brewer, John D. and Gareth I. Higgins:  Anti-Catholicism in Northern\nIreland, 1600-1998.
