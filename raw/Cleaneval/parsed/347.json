      "text": "Slate has published another good article by tech journalist Paul Boutin , who advocates HTML annotation software for bloggers ( Newsmashing: The new technique that will change blogging forever ). Basically, you would be able to copy a webpage, then annotate directly on top of it, highlighting passages, writing notes, adding links, etc. Such is possible today, of course, but a software package that made it easy (just as blogging tools made publishing easy), could be a significant change, allowing anyone who can blog to create such annotations. Being a long time fan of annotation, I think this would be great. Of course, there is the little issue of copyright violation. Certainly, if I hosted the complete original work with annotations, that could very clearly lead to a copyright claim. Under the INDUCE Act theories, the company that made the software to allow this would also be liable. After all, if you are authorized to annotate, then you can manipulate the underlying file without need for annotation software. Clearly, the intent and purpose of annotation software would be to encourage the creation of derivative works and reproductions that people are unauthorized to make. One possible solution would be to be able to create the annotations as a separate file and then layer them over the original copyrighted work. If one wanted to see the annotation, they would click a special browser link that would go to the original HTML of the work that is annotated (no copyright violation there) and then display the annotation over it (potential copyright violation). There is a drawback in that the underlying work could easily be changed to throw off the annotation, but that is a problem with linking in general. Of course, all the people who were upset with Google for changing the presentation of their work would be just as upset with all the annotators. Would this be a copyright violation? Would a software company that provided this service be guilty of inducing infringement? Currently, it is unclear how such a case would come out. I would like to think that annotation of this sort is clearly not a copyright violation inherently, but my views are not necessary shared by copyright owners and the courts. UPDATE 1410 PT Apparently Paul Boutin wanted to have an actual newsmashing contest, but lawyers shut him down! ( Newsmashing! ):"

Of course, we should all be wary of the mischief Congress accomplishes during lame duck sessions, as well as a revived INDUCE Act next term.

Copyfight pointed to an email sent by the group behind the Grammy's encouraging artists to support the INDUCE Act ( Induce Boosters Send Email to Grammy Members ). If artists think that it is in their interest to significantly increase the power of the publishers as against all others, they are sadly mistaken. When copyright law becomes even further unbalanced, it becomes a burden on artists just as much, if not more than, consumers."

The draft they will be working off has just been released.  It is much closer to the original version of the bill than the version produced by the Copyright Office a couple of weeks ago. Read the 4-page staff draft of INDUCE 2.0: Staff Draft S. 2560 - Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004 [PDF] . The bill is much more narrowly drafted with carve outs for everything that EFF had in their original mock iPod complaint: iPod, the maker of the hard drives and C|Net for reviewing it  are also presumably protected ( Prelude to a Fake Complaint ). However, the bill retains many of the provisions, including the incredibly vague \"reasonable person\" standard, as well as other issues. In any case, this is not the final draft, but only something that will be futher changed at the markup next Thursday and there may be other drafts released between now and then. More later..."

This show focuses on the Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004 (IICA, ne INDUCE Act ), with some emphasis on the recent draft from the Copyright Office . Get the show here: The INDUCE Act 2.0 . There was really not too much I had to do in this show except let two excellent experts and advocates explain what is going on with the INDUCE Act: Andrew Greenberg is an attorney with Carlton Fields and Vice-Chairman of the Intellectual Property Committee for the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers . Joshua Wattles is past president of the Los Angeles Copyright Society and the former acting general counsel of Paramount Pictures Corporation . Many thanks to both of them for an excellent show. During the show, Greenberg noted that there are also several other alternatives to the INDUCE Act. You can find out more about them here: 'Don't Induce Act' - an Alternative to the INDUCE Act (IICA) and Other News . Read on for the letter Wattles sent to key Senators regarding the bill just days after the show... Continue reading \"The Importance of ... Law and IT: The INDUCE Act 2.0\""

The letter is a response to the new version of the INDUCE Act (IICA) proposed by the Copyright Office (which I haven't yet written about, but is most definitely on my \"to do\" list). Clearly, Congress should take this letter's advice. Read the two page letter: Letter to Senators Hatch and Leahy, Re: S. 2560, Inducing Infringement of Copyrights Act of 2004, Sep. 17, 2004 [PDF] .

      "text": "The undersigned entities are writing to express their concerns with the Copyright Office's September 9, 2004 recommended statutory language for a new form of secondary liability for copyright infringement.  We commend the Copyright Office for its efforts to meet with the many different stakeholders and to fashion a recommendation that attempts to address the competing interests.  Notwithstanding the Copyright Office's hard work and creativity, the September 9 draft is not ready for mark-up by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The draft raises a host of new issues and would create an unprecedented new form of liability of uncertain, but potentially unlimited, reach. The Copyright Office's most recent approach would create a new form of strict copyright liability for a large class of providers of hardware, software and services used in conjunction with the electronic or physical dissemination of goods, services, and information.  These companies and institutions could be found liable without regard to their knowledge, intent, or relationship to the infringer, simply for providing a product, service, facility or financing.  All it takes to be found liable is to meet one of the three vague criteria proposed by the Copyright Office, which are to be applied to some undefined subset of a defendant's products or services.  As a result, anyone involved in the development or operation of electronic, or even physical, communication, distribution, or dissemination technologies could be strictly liable when it unknowingly derives revenue that may be small in relation to its own provision of goods and services.  Perhaps most troubling, entities that participate in the Internet and other electronic space would have no way of structuring their activities to anticipate and avoid -- or even minimize -- these risks. The Copyright Office's new draft fails to codify the Supreme Court's Betamax decision, which, despite having fostered twenty years of explosive growth in technology, is now under unrelenting attack.  Moreover, the Betamax doctrine will provide no defense against the Copyright Office's proposed new form of liability.  Nor would it be availing to present any defense based on lack of knowledge, intent, or affiliation with any infringer. Thus, legitimate enterprises may have no effective means of preventing the substantial litigation cost of virtually every infringement case going to trial.  The September 9 draft also explicitly opens the door to secondary liability -- posing yet another challenge and obstacle -- to those who finance new ventures or \"incubate\" new technologies.  Thus, it may sweep up far more than bad actors who build business models based in infringement. While the decision to embark on a new approach shows that the Copyright Office has been willing to listen to criticism of previous approaches and to explore new directions, the very novelty of this approach suggests that further analysis and review are in order.  Indeed, each major alternative that has been presented to your staff (including those emanating from the private sector) has revealed an attempt to avoid the pitfalls of S. 2560 as introduced, yet has differed dramatically from other serious proposals.  No private or public sector consensus has yet formed as to theoretical framework and practical impact. In the first hearing on S.2560, the Committee called on interested parties to propose legislative alternatives.  The resulting process has led to a number of significant alternatives, which differ greatly from the original and from each other.  However, each would work a fundamental change in copyright law, with potentially enormous impact on the competitiveness and economic growth of this nation.  Before any approach becomes law, it should, at minimum, be subjected to careful scrutiny in a public hearing at which novel elements in these approaches can be compared, and discussed as to their full implications.  The process thus far has been constructive, but has not resulted in either the consensus or the confidence in a legislative framework that ought to underlie a major and consequential revision to the Copyright Act. We continue to appreciate the seriousness and cordiality with which your staffs have approached this issue, and look forward to continuing to work with you and with them.

See, Senators Put Copyright Office in Charge of Finding INDUCE Act (IICA) \"Consensus\" by Sep 7 and Copyright Office Produces 'Discussion Draft' Alternative to INDUCE Act (IICA) . Two sources have confirmed that the report has been submitted to the Senate, but the report will not be released publicly until Senate staffers have had a chance to review it. Of course, I wonder why the delay in making the report public? Is it going to change between now and when the Senate deigns to release it? Why is this an appropriate way of dealing with a public report? Anyway, I've got some other things to do today. Hopefully, I'll be able to take a look at it as soon as someone decides the report is fit for the people who paid for it. Want to know more about the INDUCE Act?

Send list suggestions to ernest.miller 8T aya.yale.edu. Today on Hatch's Hit List : Broadcatching Combine RSS (w/enclosures) with BitTorrent and you get what I call \" broadcatching .\" It is, in my view, a revolutionary method for multimedia publishing and distribution without gatekeepers. Problem is, like email and http and ftp and p2p, anyone can post any sort of content in the enclosures and easily distribute it. In fact, undoubtedly, broadcatching will be used by many for infringement.  People will share their favorite (and copyrighted) television programs and movies with others. And, if the RSS is private (aka a \" darknet \"), how will the RIAA or MPAA be able to find and punish the infringers? The tools for using broadcatching will undoubtedly encourage people to use them for illicit purposes, such as with instructions that \"any large file could be put into an enclosure\" or something similar. Clearly, the whole broadcatching thing is going to have to be strictly regulated. Perhaps we can require that all RSS feeds be registered, so that they can be monitored? Broadcatching software will definitely need dialog boxes that ask if the user is sure they want to add content to an enclosure, as it might be copyrighted. Newsreaders will need dialog boxes that ask subscribers whether they want to download the enclosures (they might be copyrighted). Because broadcatching is a direct and immediate threat to the business models of Hollywood, it will certainly be a prime target for any lawsuits Hollywood can throw against it.

But new legislation that's being pushed through the Senate by lobbyists for the music and movie industries would override the Betamax decision and create a huge liability for any business that makes products which can copy sound or video. This legislation (formerly known as the INDUCE Act) would essentially give Hollywood veto power over a huge range of new technologies. And if they get this power, they'll definitely use it: just as they tried to stomp out the VCR in the 70's and 80's, the music and movie industries want to force all content to go through their own restricted channels."
