Coming from a country that has brought so much suffering to many\r\n  people, we are very aware that if you cannot solve your problems amidst peace\r\n  you cannot solve them amidst war. We support your negotiations toward peace. Iaffirm the saying in Swahili, which says, \"When the cattle join together the\r\n  lion goes to sleep hungry.\" As well there is a staying in Ethiopia that speaks\r\n  of climbing a tree to see afar. We would like to climb the tree with you to\r\n  look into the future in the search for genuine peace in Sudan. We will do all\r\n  we can to support this peace process.

      "text": "When we come to the purpose for which we have gathered, we were informed last\r\nSeptember that there would be a Nuer Dinka meeting in Tonj County. Preparations\r\nwere made then, but somewhere in the middle we began to doubt that the meeting\r\nmight not be a success. Why were we doubting? We were doubting because, in the\r\ncourse of preparations, there were things that were supposed to be done. But we\r\nfound that little or nothing had been done as far as some services had\r\nproceeded. Communication was not prompt from Nairobi to our end. We were\r\nreceiving communication at some points, but at others we were lost in the line.\r\nThere were times when we had difficulty knowing who was to do what, who was to\r\nprepare what. But in time we found that Mr. Mario Muor Muor and Tular Deng had\r\nbeen given certain responsibilities. Icame to this place to speak with the\r\nchiefs asking that they get on with the work of construction as quickly as\r\npossible. Building got underway, as did the digging of a well. However, it is\r\nunfortunate that we have only one well, which results in the congestion which we\r\nhave experienced. So later on when we saw Mr. Mario running back and forth, we\r\nwere struck by words like those of Shakespeare, which said: ?? We knew that we\r\nwould have to redouble our efforts. Buildings would have to be built quickly.\r\nLike these buildings were build quickly in a way that is inadequate to the\r\nmodern way of preparation. This is why we have many of us sitting on the ground.\r\nSo much for that, let us proceed. Here, let us come to the very matter for which we have gathered. It is good\r\nto say that we are here to record a very important event in Tonj county in\r\nparticular. This is a rare opportunity, hardly to be equalled in our history.\r\nThe Nuer and the Dinka are one people given their social and cultural\r\nbackgrounds. But in the course of time we have been divided by the enemies of\r\nthe people to fight ourselves. However, it is okay because all of us are aware\r\nthat sons quarrel with their father, and daughters with their mothers, but there\r\ncomes a time when a family sits together to resolve their differences.\r\nYesterday, who could not see the white bull outside here? The bull that was very\r\nfierce, that was almost on the neck of everyone who passed? That bull was not\r\nbrought by accident, but it was brought by design, and that was a design for\r\npeace. So, with the words of the spearmasters over this bull yesterday, Ithought that the entire effort was finished, and that we had come here simply\r\nfor formalities. If we did understand the words of the spearmasters talking\r\noutside over the bull, and even inside here, Idon't think we have much more to\r\nsay. It has been done. We have only to reflect on the wise resolutions which we\r\ncan make to bring the words spoken to their fulfilment. Something small that Iwould have said before, Iwill have to say now. Our\r\nmeeting for peace has brought people from far away. Dr. Peter Nyot is here from\r\nGermany, and Michael Wal has come from the US, both have come from afar to join\r\nwith us. This shows us that this is a serious matter since those from far away\r\nare joining with us here. As well, our foreign press people show that this is a\r\nworld-wide concern, since organisations from far away have sent their\r\nrepresentatives. We have even asked ourselves concerning some people, how they\r\nhave come, if they were invited by the churches or other people. I'm seeing\r\nbrother Samuel Aru with a very serious delegation from Khartoum, so Ihave asked\r\nmyself if Omer Bashir is interested in peace. Anyway, translation of this kind,\r\nmakes a very short speech, to be far too long. Therefore I'll conclude by speaking to the Dinka Chiefs and the Nuer Chiefs.\r\nMine is a word of caution to you. You spoke well yesterday as spearmasters, as\r\nelders, and as leaders. Iwould want that to be repeated today. because we have\r\ncome here to look for peace and reconciliation and unity. Iam not saying that\r\nyou should not air out your views, but that you should air out your views in a\r\nconstructive manner. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here.\r\nYou are to say your viewpoints here cool headed, rationally, and without raising\r\nyour emotions. All of us, the intellectual guest, are here to help you come to\r\nhelpful resolutions. You must say the right thing. It may happen that at some\r\npoint one of you will call for us to close the discussion because we are all\r\nsaying the same things. Avoid unhelpful arguments, matters that are not\r\nnecessary in our discussion of peace and reconciliation. Let us avoid matters\r\nthat look like we are in the courtroom. This is not a court we are creating\r\nhere. So, before Igo, Iwould like my counterpart, the Commissioner, to come here,\r\nso that we extend to each other, the greetings of peace. (The Nuer\r\nCommissioner comes forward, and the two grasp hands, holding their hands aloft\r\nbefore the community; the people on both sides respond with songs, chants,\r\naffirming the meeting. Nuer move into a full chant with extended responses). TD: Idon't have much to do, since the Commissioner has already invited the\r\nCommissioner from Leer. Commissioner of Ler, Joseph Juac Kon:"

Having heard this we all\r\nslept very soundly, with the hope of these words. Also, as we are witnessing\r\npeople as they speak, we are further convinced by the actions of Commander Selva.\r\nWe are glad to see his firm, practical commitment to facilitating this effort\r\ntoward peace between our peoples. Iwant to correct the statement made by our elder William, yesterday, when he\r\nsaid that he was a thief. He did not mean that he himself was a thief. We are\r\nall children of one father. Those who are raiding cattle are William's children,\r\nand thus he identifies with them. It seems this was misunderstood. Historically,\r\nwe Nuer, have so many Dinka with us, and so many of our chiefs were originally\r\nDinka. When Dinka came to settle in our land, we usually gave him the first\r\nplace, choosing him as leader. We have no difficulty with a man from afar being\r\na leader among our people.

When we met in Loki the\r\nchiefs and churchleaders from the West side of the Nile put together their plans\r\nfor this conference. One of the things they said was that this would be a\r\nconference of the people, in which local people would take the lead, and it\r\nwould not include poliltical leaders. They may be present as observers but not\r\nas participants. They said that all of the people must be mobilised to\r\nparticipate in this conference, that NSCC should prepare the Conference, and\r\nthat observers from around the world must be invited to attend. So for these\r\nmany months there have been numerous people involved. Gradually the group has\r\nchanged, with women and chiefs always part of the process, and always there has\r\nbeen the desire to have Dinka and Nuer from outside as full partners in the\r\nprocess. So Inow want to introduce you to some of those people who are here\r\nnow. Some are not present, but have worked hard over the months, but I'll\r\nintroduce you to those who are now with us.

We have had two women who have been involved with us, Awut Deng whom you\r\nheard speak this morning. The second is Nyawaraga Joshua who is not able to be\r\nwith us today. We have asked intellectuals from the Diaspora to come and be part\r\nof this team. One of those is Dr. Peter Nyot Kok from Germany, and the other is\r\nDr. Michael Lual Duany from the USA. Always, as it was possible, we have asked\r\nthat Chiefs meet with us so that they could observe if we were keeping on the\r\npath that was set for us at Loki. And I, Dr. Bill Lowrey, have served as a\r\nfacilitator for this Team. The two chiefs who have been most involved with us\r\nthroughout this process are, first, Chief Dut Malual, who Iunderstand is sick\r\nin Nairobi, and we are missing him. The second of them is Chief Isaac Magok from\r\nLeer (stands, waving his fly whisk). Now Iwould like to tell you a short story from the Bible, that sets the\r\nstage for the Dinka to tell their story before the Nuer, and for the Nuer to\r\ntell their story before the Dinka. This is a story that Itold in Loki for the\r\nchiefs and leaders in Loki, and that was the beginning of three days in which\r\nthey told their stories, each group to the other. As you know, today is Sunday,\r\nwhich is the first day of the week. It was on a Sunday, after Jesus had died on\r\nthe cross and been raised from the dead, that this story took place. Most of the\r\ndisciples were together in a special room, but one was missing. His name was\r\nThomas. And suddenly Jesus appeared in the room, and his message was, \"Peace be\r\nwith you.\" The disciples were excited to see him, but when they told Thomas, he\r\nwould not believe it. He said, unless Isee him, and put my fingers in his side\r\nwhere the spear went in, Iwill not believe it. One week later, again on a\r\nSunday, Jesus appeared in the room and Thomas was present. Jesus said to Thomas,\r\n\"Reach out your fingers and feel the wound where the spear went in.\" This is a conference about reconciliation. Thomas could not be reconciled\r\nuntil he could see the wounds that he had helped to cause, and touch the places\r\nwhere Jesus had been wounded. For seven and a half years now, Nuer have caused\r\nwounds and injuries to the Dinka, and for seven and a half years now, Dinka have\r\ncaused wounds and injuries to the Nuer. If you want to be reconciled you must\r\ntell each other the wounds you have suffered, you must look at each other, and\r\nreach out and touch one another in the places where you have been wounded. It\r\nwill be important that you speak the truth, that you not hide anything from\r\nanother, so that the reconciliation goes deep, and it is a genuine healing of\r\nthe wounds you have inflicted. When you speak the truth, when you say the hard\r\nthings to each other, when you identify the issues that must be solved, then you\r\ncan reconcile relationships, and you can walk out of here, saying now we are\r\nbrothers and sisters once again. In just a few minutes, you as the Dinka, will\r\nbegin to tell the Nuer your stories. Do not hold back. Tell the true stories, no\r\nmatter how painful it may be. In just a few minutes, when the Dinka tell their\r\nstories, you Nuer, you must listen carefully. Do not debate with them, do not\r\nargue with them. Relationships begin with listening. And when they have finished\r\nyou will tell your stories to them. The time of beautiful speeches is over. It\r\nis now time for the hard work of peace. You must make a peace that will last.\r\nWhen Isit down, this will be your work. You, Nuer and Dinka, must make this\r\npeace and determine how deep the peace will go. May God give you the strength\r\nyou need. TD:"

Some months ago Iattended the meeting in Loki for the purpose of\r\nreconciliation between Dinka and Nuer. When Ireturned from Loki Idisseminated\r\nthe content of the Accord among Dinka and Nuer. Recently, Ialso participated in\r\nthe exchange visits of the Chiefs, stopping at Leer, and here. Yesterday we\r\nbegan our reconciliation by offering a white bull, and we said all that needed\r\nto be said, and the bull is now in its eternal existence above. It has always\r\nbeen our traditional practice that, when we have conflicts, as we often do, we\r\nmake sacrifice and we are able to reconcile and return to our normal life.\r\nUsually we conclude by confirming an accord between ourselves and Nuer with an\r\naccord that states we will no longer raid one another so there is no more loss\r\nof property or life. At the end of every conference we come out with\r\ndeclarations which are sent to Leer, Mapeer, Tonj, and elsewhere, confirming\r\nthat we should no longer fight each other. And the present reconciliation, being\r\nassisted by the churches, means that we address the issues that divide us and\r\nbring conflict and we put an end to them. Sometimes back we had a conference in\r\nGainlel, and we sacrificed bulls and that concluded our conflicts between Dinka\r\nand Nuer. As well, we had a conference at Wuniloor, and that meeting ended our\r\nproblems until the conflicts of Anyanya Ibrought out new conflicts between\r\nDinka and Nuer. The border conflicts intensified again with the tension between\r\nSPLA and Nuer, giving thieves concerned with their own well-being opportunity to\r\nexploit our differences. As well, our differences have been exploited by our\r\nenemies. D&Nare brothers, who share common borders. With our sacrifice\r\nyesterday our hostility was brought to an end. There are people who are against\r\nthis peace agreement, who have benefited from our hostility. There will be some\r\nwho will come trying to persuade our peoples on each side to believe that the\r\nother will not be faithful to our agreement, but we must not listen to these\r\ndeceptive words. We have always been fighting each other, D&N, but has never\r\nbefore happened that we deserted lands such as Mapeer. Today it is other people\r\nwho have come in to exacerbate these conflicts. An example is that our ancestral\r\nhome of Rumbek was in the hand in the enemy. Now that we have captured it from\r\nthe enemy we have made alterations and we are able to occupy our own lands\r\ncomfortably. As Isaid, in respect to Rumbek, Ican now return to my ancestral\r\nhome of Mapeer and we can settle there once again. Normally, in the relationship\r\nbetween us and Nuer, what keeps conflicts from being concluded, is when various\r\npretexts are brought up, saying we must locate the thief, and find the details\r\nof the case. All of these are delaying tactics, which should not deter us from\r\npeaceful coexistence. Yesterday we sealed our covenant. It is not in Dinka\r\ntradition that we should begin accusing one another, or quarrelling with one\r\nanother, after sacrifice is offered. We should not be doing this here. Our\r\ngathering here is heard all over the world, in Khartoum and Juba, and many other\r\nplaces. Thus, in my view, there is no use in talking about past grievances. What\r\nwe need to focus on is concrete actions to be taken to bring peaceful\r\nco-existence between our peoples. From this day forward we must stop the killing\r\nof women and children, and destruction of our properties. We reconcile ourselves\r\nfrom Yirol, Rumbek and Bentiu. Iwill not proceed further with my address. This\r\nis the message I'm telling the people of Gogrial and Tuic, that our\r\nreconciliation was concluded yesterday with the offering of our white bull. This\r\nis my word."

This conference we declare that we have fully accepted this\r\nreconciliation. If we were in a court Iwould have asked questions from the\r\npeople of Bentiu. When people first began going to Bongo, the training camp, it\r\nwas because of the problem of the South that took them. When those who went to\r\nBongo split apart, it was unfortunate that we accepted that separation. Inever\r\nthought there was a government in Leer, until Isaw the Commissioner of Leer. Ihave no bad commissioner from Leer. When we said earlier that we should save\r\nlives, Ialso accept fully what you said, because Ihave a border with Chief\r\nMalual Wun. In my community Ihave a few people from Bentiu, like those staying\r\nhere at Wunlit. Our relationship with the people of Adoor, that is those of\r\nYirol and Rumbek, is that we are children of one family. We had no part in the\r\ndivision that had happened. When Isaid Iwanted to ask question of the people\r\nof Bentiu, Iactually wanted to ask questions of those of Adoor. As a good\r\ngesture, and to declare that we accept peace, Iwant to say that those who\r\nraided cattle on the 18th have now been apprehended, and the cattle are to be\r\nreturned. The civil administration in Rumbek ordered all chiefs to apprehend the\r\nraiders and return the cattle. This has now been done. (TD: Ibelieve Chief\r\nChul was speaking of two raids. One was on the 19th of February, and the other\r\non the 8th. Ibelieve that the those who were responsible for the first have\r\nbeen apprehended.) Before all who are in attendance here Iwant to affirm\r\nthat we have agreed to accept the peace between us. At present we have people\r\nwho have gone from Yirol to Adoor and they have been welcomed by the residents.\r\nIwill conclude here by saying that we have reconciled with the people of Malual\r\nWun as of today."

If there is a complicated problem, and your\r\nfather is still alive, he would be the one who restrains the children from self\r\ndestruction. The wisdom of CMW and our wisdom is not the same. He began working\r\nsince the time of the British with our fathers. Most of us began working during\r\nthe time of independence with the Arabs.

If it were a court we would enumerate our grievances. If we are committed\r\nto reconciliation, let us not account for the past. Let us simply enter the\r\nreconciliation and act as brothers.

Inow want our brothers to speak out the grievances they have against\r\nme so Ican understand. But the source of our quarrel is this, the Nuer and we\r\nare one. Idon't look at them as enemies. We share one toc and one border\r\nbetween us. We regard them as our elders to ourselves because their father is\r\nelder. When their father was born he could not her but was deaf. When my father\r\nwas born he was blind. He came in a secret way, my deaf uncle to raid my cattle\r\nbecause my father could not see. My father went to God and said that this\r\nbrother comes and steals my cattle. And God said, okay, it is something good.\r\nGod gave a girl to our Dinka father who was blind. Once he married, he never\r\nproduced another blind man among his children. And the deaf father of Nuer never\r\nproduced a deaf man. All their children have been healthy. Idon't know what has\r\nhappened. After we have produced good children we still carry on this old\r\ntradition because they have not liberated themselves from the way of their\r\nfather. Today God went to bring a foreigners and told them, if these two peoples\r\nquarrel, stand between them, and see why they are quarrelling. Today, especially\r\nit is the Church leaders who have come here. It is the right time for them to\r\nask us what our problem is so that it can be resolved between us. What Iknow in\r\nmy heart this year, after they have killed our children, and killed our\r\nchildren, and taken all our cattle, and all the goats, after all of this, what\r\nremains is only their brother who is blind is their brother. They can take their\r\nblind brother and kill him. This is not the first reconciliation talks. We began\r\nthem in Gainlel, and again we came to Mal. Today, in Wunlit, this is the third\r\npeace reconciliation. Those of you who have organised this conference, Iask you\r\nto invite our brother Nuer to speak out precisely what is in them, why they have\r\ndestroyed us. You who organised this conference, Iwill not bother to talk about\r\nthe loss of the cattle, or other property, or dead people. What we want from\r\nyou, our brothers, are those young girls. Sincerely speaking, Iask you to send\r\nour girls back, we will console ourselves with them. Please release them to us. The second point to finalise my talk: if we want to be reconciled.

It is very good that\r\nour children whom we've taken to school to learn English and Arabic have also\r\ncome to Wunlit, and that all people will now be able to hear that we have met at\r\nWunlit to bring peace to the land. Yesterday during the opening the military\r\nauthorities of the SPLA were here and we have seen them. We did not, however,\r\nknow that there were military and civil administration from Bentiu who were\r\nlikewise with us. We are glad to hear that there is a military commander coming\r\ndirectly from where Riak is staying to be in our deliberations, and that he will\r\nreturn to tell Riak of our progress."

      "text": "The first thing Iwould like to say, concerns we chiefs, who have remained\r\nwith our people in S. Sudan and sent our children to schools or to Bilpham for\r\ntraining. The problems that occurred at Bilpham did not begin there, but they\r\noriginated right here prior to their departure. In 1984 a group of young men\r\nfrom Gogrial and Tonj began departing for Bilpham. As they went they naturally\r\nhad to pass through Nuerland. As they reached Abuong they were intercepted. Many\r\nwere killed and others were drowned while some returned. This had nothing to do\r\nwith the leadership. In the spirit of reconciliation we must begin with the\r\ngenesis of the problem. It is not with the leadership. We would like to know the\r\nchief who was responsible for the killing of our young men as they were en route\r\nto Bilpham. It is important to begin with the genesis of the problem. That is\r\nwhy Iasked for the senior military commander. That route through Abuong became\r\nunsafe for our the passage of our people and we were forced to move any parties\r\nthrough Bor area as our only alternative route. Ichallenge you, asking someone\r\nto come and tell me that this is not the real state of affairs, as Ihave\r\ndescribed it. The route through Bor was a far longer route for our people. When\r\nwe decide to reconcile and become one, Imust tell you that, currently, we now\r\nhave two of our people with you in Nuer. They have now devastated Gograil, . . .\r\nand Tuic areas. When you prepared to come, did you first really speak with them\r\nto ask what they intend to do. If we are sincere about reconciliation Iaddress\r\nmyself to those from Nuer area. You have with us Carbino Kwanyiny Bol and Matip.\r\nDoes it really make sense for us to reconcile if they are not with us, because\r\nthese two people are with you now. If we reconcile without their participation Ibelieve our efforts will be incomplete. s we are all Southerners, we have lost\r\nour women and children, cattle and properties. Iam glad to here that the\r\nCommissioner from Bentiu is here with us. As you saw yesterday, we have\r\nresponsible people with us here from our side. Iwould hope we can also speak\r\nwith Riak Machar to tell him that we as Southerners have lost everything we\r\npossess through our conflicts. First let us be practical, you the chiefs from Nand from D. As you have seen yesterday, we don't have an army. Yesterday\r\nGovernor Nhial Deng Nhial and Commander Selva Kiir were here to guard any\r\nagreement we come to in this place. What about you? Who will ensure that our\r\nagreement stands firm in your areas? When Chief Majok came here . . . Tell me,\r\nif we go to your area will we find that our Dinka are still alive there? As Isaid before, the Nuer are here with their property, they are here with their\r\ncattle and their children. If you want to take them with you are welcome to take\r\nthem. But Iwould only ask that you reciprocate, allowing our Dinka people to\r\nreturn to us also. Iconclude with greetings, and emphasise before the\r\norganisers, that this peace and reconciliation will be monitored, so that the\r\nDinka can go to Nuerland and claim their properties and likewise the Nuer can\r\ncome to Dinkaland to receive what belongs from them.

Among the speakers from Tonj Country is Sadia . . . and in the\r\nspirit of this conference we would also like to hear the voice of our women. We\r\nwill begin tomorrow at 9:00 again hearing the narratives of the Dinka. We will\r\ngive three hours for the remainder of the presentations from the Dinka.
