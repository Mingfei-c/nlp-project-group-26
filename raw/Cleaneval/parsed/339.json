      "text": "HOW TO WIN BEFORE THE BOARD OF\r\nEQUALIZATION Actually, the title is a little misleading; because you can't always win,\r\nbut if you have good reasons for your appeal this information should help you present your\r\ncase. The Board of Equalization was created by the Legislature to give citizens\r\nan opportunity to contest the Assessor's valuation of their property.  However, the\r\nLegislature realized that counties get most of their revenue from property taxes, and if\r\nit was easy to get the valuation reduced counties would soon run out of money.  The\r\nLegislature handled this by saying in effect \"Ok, you have the right to appeal your\r\nvaluation but we're going to make it an uphill battle for you to win.\" The Legislature accomplished this by saying, \"The Assessor's\r\nvaluation is assume to be correct.  In order for the taxpayer to win his appeal he\r\nmust show by Clear, Cogent, and Convincing Reasoning that the Assessor\r\nhas made a mistake.\"  Clear, cogent, and convincing evidence means a quantum of\r\nproof which is less than beyond a reasonable doubt, but more than a mere preponderance of\r\nthe evidence.  It is the quantum of evidence necessary to convince the trier of fact\r\nthat the ultimate fact in issue is \"highly probably.\"  Most Boards of\r\nEqualization take this to mean that the taxpayer's evidence must make it pretty obvious\r\nthat the Assessor made a mistake.  The key word in the last sentence is the word\r\n\"evidence\".  You must give good evidence to support your appeal. Let me give you an example.  You and your next door neighbor get a\r\nletter from the Assessor informing you that the value of each house has risen to $75,000.\r\n  Both houses are identical and both of you fill an appeal before the Board of\r\nEqualization.  Your neighbor comes before the Board and says, \"This assessment\r\nis ridiculous; my house can't possibly be worth more than $55,000.  I only paid\r\n$35,000 for it seven years ago.  I plan to live the rest of my life in this house.\r\n  I'm not going to sell it to make a fast buck!\" When it is your turn to go before the Board, you say, \"This\r\nassessment is ridiculous; my house can't be worth more than $55,000.\"  Then you\r\nshow the Board that three other houses in the area have been sold in the last year.  \r\nThe house that was identical to yours sold for $54,000, another house that is similar to\r\nyours sold for $56,000.  The last house, which was better than yours, sold for\r\n$66,000.  You show the Board that no houses in the area have sold for more than\r\n$66,000.  Now this is a pretty simple example by 99 times out of 100 the Board of\r\nEqualization will rule in the following manner:  you win your appeal, but your\r\nneighbor's appeal is denied.  The reasoning behind these two rulings is this:  \r\nyour neighbor did not present any evidence that supported his contention that the Assessor\r\nmade a mistake, on the other hand you gave some good hard evidence that supported your\r\nappeal. Let me explain about the sort of evidence that Boards of Equalization like\r\nand don't like to see.  If you tell us that your roof leaks and that there is water\r\ndamage in the house, bring us some pictures that show the damage.  Bring an estimate\r\nfrom a contractor showing how must it will cost to fix the roof.  If your foundation\r\nis cracked and the floor is buckled, bring some estimates of the cost to repair\r\neverything.  Bring us pictures that backup your contentions.  If the Assessor\r\nsays your house is worth $50,000 and you have tried for the last year to sell the house\r\nfor $45,000 and had no offers, bring a letter from your Realtor confirming it.  Show\r\nus that a house similar to yours, sold for a good deal less than the assessed value of\r\nyour house.  The Board of Equalization is delighted to see good hard evidence. The Board is not impressed with appeals based on emotion.  Don't jump\r\nup and down about the percent of tax increase.  It doesn't matter what the percentage\r\nof increase is as long as the marketplace will support the value.  Don't tell us that\r\nyour grandfather bought the property for $100 fifty years ago and that you have no\r\nintentions of ever selling out just to make a buck.  The Board could care less about\r\nyour intentions; the only thing we care about is the present market value. The best place to get sales information is the Assessor's office.  \r\nAll recorded sales in the county are available there.  It will take time and energy\r\nbut the information is available to you.  The easiest way to get another appraisal is\r\nto hire a fee appraiser.  The fee appraiser can do all the work for you.   The\r\ndownside to hiring a fee appraiser is the cost.  In addition, the fee appraiser's\r\nreport may or may not support your appeal. There are three methods for determining the market value of a piece of\r\nproperty:  the Direct Sales Comparison method, the Cost Approach to Value, and the\r\nIncome Approach to Value.  While each method has its strengths and weaknesses, the\r\ndirect sales comparison method generally carries the most weight.  Almost anyone can\r\nuse the direct sales comparison method; all the information you need can be found in the\r\nAssessor's office.  If you are going to use the cost approach or the income approach\r\nit might be wise to take to your accountant and an attorney. Bring us an argument based only on emotion and outrage and you won't have\r\na chance; bring us some good hard persuasive evidence and the Board may be able to grant\r\nyour appeal.
