You can include extensions of\r\nyour thesis: ideas it has spawned, or tests of it you will someday do. At least\r\none idea should be distinct from your thesis.

Be sure to know the needs of the department before answering this one.\r\nMention undergrad and grad courses, and perhaps an advanced grad course. The\r\nadvanced courses are sought after; don't sound as if you demand to teach one.\r\nMention a service course (intro, micro, or macro) that you are willing to\r\nteach.

      "text": "I was trained as a graduate student to read other people's research. Then I\r\nfinished my special field exams and was told to go write some research. I\r\ncompare my experience to learning how to read literature, then being asked to do\r\ncreative writing. Not unrelated, but hardly the same set of skills. Here is\r\nsome advice I found helpful when I was searching for a topic. Hints for finding paper topics : Choosing a paper topic requires\r\nbalancing the importance and feasibility of the topic. Feasibility involves\r\ntractability for theoretical research, and data availability for empirical\r\nresearch. I recommend creating a number of one-page paper proposals, each with\r\na topic sentence and data source. There are several heuristics for finding researchable paper topics. One way\r\nis to list three of four papers you like. This list may hint at the style,\r\npolitical point of view, level of abstraction, and methods that are appropriate\r\nfor you. Other paper ideas are motivated by bad research, not good: find statements\r\nby policy-makers, analysts and journalists that make you angry, and find data\r\nsets to address the issue. When studying for exams, keep a list of stupid\r\nthings you read to return to during the dissertation stage. Don't be afraid of normal science: repeating in a longitudinal data set what\r\nothers have done only in the cross section. Some paper ideas are data-driven:\r\nread codebooks from a variety of data sets and see if certain questions spark\r\nideas or tests of theories you find interesting. For every paper you read,\r\nthink what else you would have done with that dataset or methodology. Write a paper , not a dissertation. A dissertation can be a daunting\r\nprospect. If possible, focus on a 25-page paper with a clear one-sentence\r\ntopic. If you like this paper, then it can become the basis of a dissertation.\r\nI promise you that just about any topic can grow to 150 pages; nearly all\r\ntopics students first choose are WAY too broad. A dissertation is any stack of papers with three signatures on the top sheet .\r\nPaul Samuelson's dissertation was modestly entitled Foundations of Economics . It lived up to that title, and remains a\r\nclassic to this day. I initially felt that my dissertation should be, if not\r\nthat good, at least vaguely comparable in the sense of answering one of the Big\r\nQuestions. Do not fall prey, as I did, to the \"magnum opus fallacy\". A\r\ndissertation should be normal science that certifies your competency. Save the\r\nbig thoughts in a file, and get finished! Write an opus when you are a professor,\r\nand are being paid for it. Meanwhile, negotiate the smallest useful chunk of\r\nthe Big Project with your dissertation advisers, and do that single piece of\r\nresearch. A dissertation group is essential . Having folks to bounce your ideas\r\noff of at an early stage is irreplaceable. The members of your dissertation\r\ngroup do not need to have similar fields; any smart person will be useful at\r\neach stage of a project, from vague ideas through research design, and write\r\nup. All you need are people who are willing to listen to raw ideas, and willing\r\nto read first \"pre-drafts\" of chapters. This is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice.

      "text": "When people evaluate you for tenure, they need to know (1) who you are, and\r\n(2) what (one or two sentences) results you are associated with. Thus, my basic\r\nadvice is focus your research, get it read, and get seen. Sadly, the visibility\r\nof yourself is as important as the quality of your work in professional\r\nsuccess. Have a theme : You should think of your research as writing a book,\r\nnot articles. The idea is that your first five years' research should involve\r\none or two unifying themes. The reason for sticking to a theme is that people evaluating you need to be\r\nable to say \"This young scholar is one of the world's experts at\r\n_______.\" You get to fill the blank. However, your work must hold together\r\nso that there is some word or phrase they can stick in the blank. In an ideal world, academics would be able to study any important topic they\r\nwere competent to shed light on. In the real world, assistant professors are\r\nbeing evaluated; you don't need to play the game I describe, but now you know\r\nthe rules. Get read : List people who should read your papers. The list should\r\ninclude at least three groups: a dozen or so senior people in your field who\r\nare likely to write letters evaluating you when you go up for tenure;\r\nclassmates and other buddies who are likely to actually read the stuff; and\r\npeople who work on related topics and you would like to cite your stuff. Make\r\nup a master list that receives most papers, and modify it for each paper. Look\r\nat each paper's bibliography for ideas on who might want to see it. (Everyone\r\nwants to see papers that cite them -- that's why so many professors read papers\r\nfrom the back.) Typically you should mail out papers in their working paper stage, one draft\r\nbefore submission. Feedback is crucial. All research has flaws, and all drafts have\r\neasy-to-correct flaws. Make sure your research and writing has lots of feedback\r\nto fix both types. Especially for the clarity issues, be open minded. If your\r\nparents, friends, colleagues in unrelated disciplines, will read the sucker,\r\nsend it to them! Get seen : Travel every year to give seminars. If you are going to be\r\nnear a university, call up six months early and tell them you are available and\r\nwould like to give a seminar. Don't be shy: figure out how to give a talk at your field's annual\r\nconvention, and do it! Invite a mix of friends and more well-known people. Learn how to be a Manager : Secretaries and research assistants are\r\njust a few of the people you need to learn to manage. The secrets are few:\r\nrespect and communication. Respect is shown, for example, by asking their\r\nschedule when you propose work, and by always saying, \"Thank you.\" In\r\naddition, if they have expertise in a job, only give advice on how to do it if\r\nthey ask. Most attempts at communication are not completely successful. (In the\r\nclassroom this problem is reflected in my maxim: \"I can teach faster than\r\nthey can learn.\") Thus, the golden rule of communication is \"Say unto\r\nothers what you believe others have said unto you.\" After giving your\r\ninstructions, always ask your RA to explain what she thought you asked her to\r\ndo. (Do this in a way that makes it clear you consider yourself at fault for\r\nany miscommunication. Perhaps: \"I didn't explain that very well. Can you\r\ntell me what you are planning to do?\") If they don't repeat back to me\r\ntheir understanding of my instructions, then it is unlikely the job will be\r\naccomplished as I expect. Budget your research time : In economics research begun in year t\r\nusually leads to a first draft in year t+1 or t+2. Circulating it and\r\npresenting it at a seminar or two brings us to year t+3. Submit it to a journal\r\nand they will (if you are lucky) ask for a revision in year t+4, which you\r\nmight complete that year. If so, they could accept it as fast as year t+5, but\r\nit might not come out till year t+6. On the one hand, many papers can move from\r\nconception to publication in less than six years; on the other hand, many\r\npapers take more. Count back from the time you need to submit your tenure file. If you are\r\nthree years away and your case is less than 100% solid, don't begin any new\r\nresearch! At this point your priority must be to move working papers and papers\r\nwith requested revisions into the Accepted pile. This is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice.

      "text": "Authors must work hard to make their results easy to follow. Thus, tables\r\nmust be comprehensible by themselves. That is, a reader should be able to\r\nunderstand a table without reference to the text (and preferably without\r\nreference to other tables). The converse rule is that the text should stand by\r\nitself, even if a reader ignores the tables. Variable names should be self-explanatory. The text should flow\r\nwithout ever showing that the reader has encountered a variable name. For\r\nexample, \"Each plant visit by a social scientist corresponded to 3.1%\r\nhigher voluntary turnover per month (SE = .9%, P < .05)\" is much better\r\nthan \"The coefficient of SCISTUD on VOLTUR was .031 (.009),\" which is\r\nbetter than \"S and V were significantly related.\" In short, nobody\r\nshould know what passed between you and your computer in the middle of the\r\nnight. Name your dummy variable Male or Female , but not Sex . Often variables are proxies for conceptual variables. If you want to measure\r\ncomplexity, but your variable is log(employment), name the variable employment (if all variables are expressed in logs) or log(employment) , not complexity . Each table has number and a meaningful title: \"Wages Do Not Rise\r\nwith Tenure,\" not \"Wages.\" All statistical tests include the name of the test, the test statistic, and\r\nthe significance level. Include a brief description of complex procedures at\r\nthe bottom of the table. Remind readers of the meaning of complicated\r\nvariables. Each estimated equation lists the dependent variable and sample size.\r\nIf one of these is constant for an entire table, list it only once. Always\r\ninclude measures of goodness of fit such as R or log-likelihood. Usually\r\ninclude a test of the significance of the entire regression (such as an F test\r\nfor ordinary least squares), and appropriate residual diagnostics (such as\r\nDurbin-Watson statistics and heteroskedasticity tests). Coefficients should include standard errors or t statistics, and some\r\nindication of statistical significance (P values or * for P < .05,\r\n** for P < .01). A note explains whether there are standard errors or t\r\nstatistics. Report P < .10 only if the sample size is small. For very large datasets it makes sense to\r\ndemand a higher degree of certainty, so only report P < .01. Include a meaningful number of digits, usually at two or three significant\r\nplaces. Neither .34849560 (3.132534) nor 0.00 (SE = 0.00, P < .001) is\r\nuseful. Sometimes multiply or divide a variable by 10 so the coefficient is in\r\na meaningful range. Always in the text, and often in the tables, translate the coefficients of\r\ninterest into words. For example, convert logit coefficients to measure how a\r\none-unit change in the variable affects the probability of the occurrence of\r\nthe event (dP/dX). Translate hazard rate coefficients to show how a one unit\r\nchange in the variable affects the expected time until some event occurs:\r\n\"If the union local is in a city, its expected lifetime was four months\r\nshorter than if it was rural.\" Also, always explain whether the effect is large or not, perhaps by\r\ncomparing its size to something readers understand. For example, the importance\r\nof marital status on wages can be expressed as how many years of education are\r\nrequired to raise wages by as much. Sometimes standardized coefficients\r\n(expressed in standard deviation units) are useful: \"A one month increase\r\nin training (approximately one standard deviation) corresponds to 4 percent\r\nlower turnover (approximately one half of a standard deviation).\" Effect sizes from Lisrel, factor analysis, path analysis, ordered logits,\r\netc., are hard to understand. Thus, explain the size as well as the statistical\r\nsignificance of the important effects. Statistical significance : Most authors focus on whether coefficients\r\nare statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 percent\r\nlevel. Thus, if b 1 is\r\nstatistically significant from zero at the 5% level, but b 2 is not,\r\nsome authors write as if b 1 is different from and more important\r\nthan b 2 . At a minimum, authors\r\nshould focus on confidence intervals, and explicitly test if b 1 and\r\nb 2 differ by statistically significant amounts. Summary statistics should be included for the referee, although they do\r\nnot always need to be in the paper. Usually include means, standard deviations,\r\nunits, sources, geographical region covered, and sample size. Usually include\r\nsummary statistics for control variables as well as for the main variables of\r\ninterest. Include the statistics for the un-logged version of any important\r\nvariables you use in log form. If your paper computes important and meaningful\r\nintermediate results (residuals from a first-stage equation, for example),\r\ninclude their summary statistics. Often give the referee a table of correlations of either the main variables\r\nor of all the variables. Use simple statistical procedures to complement fancier analyses. Many\r\npapers have a simple comparison of means as their main result (to be formalized\r\nand measured more precisely in later sections). If your paper has such a\r\ncomparison at its core, then present the unadjusted means (e.g., men vs. women,\r\nor U.S. vs. Japan ) before\r\nthe fancier statistical analysis. Figures and graphs , like tables, are supposed to be comprehensible\r\nwithout reference to the text, and the text without reference to the figure.\r\nPlace labels (in words, not symbols or variable names) and units on axes. Equations worthy of being in your paper can be expressed as a\r\nsentence. Do so. Many economic theories generate an interesting first-order\r\ncondition. Restate it in words: \"At the optimum, a dollar spent today must\r\nbring the same utility as a dollar spent tomorrow, suitably discounted.\" Abstracts present the question the paper will answer. Since social\r\nscientists are not mystery writers, abstracts also summarize the results.\r\nInability to write an abstract of fewer than 100 words often indicates deeper\r\nproblems with the paper."

      "text": "No research is perfect. This section presents a checklist of common\r\nimperfections in empirical research. Discuss the limitations of your paper and\r\nplausible alternate explanations for the results. Surveys face problems with the match between the actual sample and\r\nthe perfect sample. Always mention the response rates and possible response\r\nbiases. Are responses likely to be sensitive to changes in the wording of the\r\nquestions? Do respondents have incentives to hide their attitudes? Are\r\nattitudes likely to match behaviors? A naming issue appears when data undergo factor analysis or are summed into\r\nan index. Do not merely name the factors or indices, but present a sample of\r\nthe questions along with the factor weights. Differentiate exploratory from\r\nconfirmatory factor analysis. Econometric and statistical analyses are subject to all the\r\ndifficulties of surveys. They also fall prey to the \"textbook\r\nchapters:\" simultaneity, sample selection, measurement error, outliers,\r\nand so forth. Almost all analyses should\r\nuse methods that adjust for clustering of the sample (as in most common\r\ndatasets) and that are robust to the presence of heteroskedasticity. Re-analyze the data several times to check\r\nthe specification, and make sure that your results are not sensitive to changes\r\nin the estimating technique, functional forms, control variables, and so forth.\r\nIf all is well, allude to these results briefly, but do not include them in the\r\npaper. Often include copies of these tables for the referee. Experiments almost always have questionable external validity. Is\r\nthere any reason to believe people in actual organizations involved in complex\r\nsocial networks making decisions that affect their careers over many years act\r\nthe way the college sophomores do in your one-hour treatment? Is the name you have given your treatment appropriate? If you tell one group\r\nof people they are not worth the wage they receive, this treatment may affect\r\nself-esteem as well as perceived equity. Thus, naming the treated group perceived\r\ninequity can mislead readers. Case studies have limited generalizability. Explain in what sense\r\nthis case study generalizes, and outline the limits of its generalizability.\r\nWhat are the likely biases due to subjective perception and reporting? Causality is almost never clear in the social sciences. Common\r\nproblems include reverse causality, selection effects, and omitted variable\r\nbias. Discuss alternative causal explanations for the results. These alternative channels often suggest\r\nadditional tests you might perform. When using instrumental variables or multi-equation methods such as\r\ntwo-stage least squares and maximum likelihood, always list your instruments or\r\nother identifying assumptions. Include these lists in both the text and the\r\ntables. Justify why it is plausible that your instruments are exogenous. Both\r\nidentification by functional form (as in many sample selection models) and\r\ninstrumenting with lagged variables require strong justification. Economic theory : Explain the robustness of the results in\r\n\"assumption space.\" Differentiate assumptions that are crucial from\r\nthose that merely simplify. Even if you do not prove, explain what happens if\r\npreferences are not Cobb-Douglas, or if agents are not identical. Usually\r\ninclude detailed derivations in an appendix for the referee."
