It contains current information on Indonesian CDM policies and project implementation. Both articles were compiled by NEDO's representative offices in Washington, D.C. and Jakarta. \"NEDO Kaigai Report\" is a biweekly publication and features news articles and summaries as well as other information related to the development of oil-alternative energy and industrial technology outside of Japan.
