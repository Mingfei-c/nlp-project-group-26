      "text": "The annual report U.S. Medical School Faculty is a set of 20 tables \r\n        that answer common questions about the national distribution of full-time \r\n        faculty. The information is displayed by specialty, department, rank, \r\n        degree, sex, and race/hispanic origin. (Data on part-time faculty, volunteer, \r\n        and emeritus faculty are excluded.) From 1986-1997, printed copies of U.S. Medical School Faculty were distributed to medical school deans, Faculty Roster representatives, \r\n        and other selected constituents. The report is now published online only \r\n        and is produced using a database snapshot from December 31. Prior to December \r\n        31, 1997, the publication was based on a June 30 database snapshot. Note that the AAMC Faculty Roster does not necessarily reflect official \r\n        faculty counts. As a result, the figures in these tables should be viewed \r\n        and used with care. While the proportion of faculty across key variables \r\n        may be reasonably accurate, the number of faculty may not be. For the \r\n        official faculty figures, please visit the Medical School Profile System \r\n        at http://services.aamc.org/mspsreports. Although the Medical School Profile \r\n        System reflects official faculty counts that institutions provide as part \r\n        of their accreditation process, the Medical School Profile System does \r\n        not always provide the kind of detail that the Faculty Roster provides. The following issues of the report are available online:"
