      "text": "Share Our Strength's Operation Frontline is a nutrition education program that fights childhood hunger by teaching families how to make healthy and budget-wise food choices. Operation Frontline's hands-on classes are taught in the kitchen by professional chefs and nutritionists who volunteer to share their strength by teaching nutrition, cooking, and budgeting to low-income adults and children.  The goal of Operation Frontline is to provide a long-term solution to hunger and poor nutrition by teaching participants how to select, purchase, and prepare healthy low-cost food for their families. Since 1993, Operation Frontline has provided effective nutrition education to over 32,000 low-income families facing hunger and poor nutrition. Operation Frontline programs are run in 14 states across the country in partnership with city-wide social service agencies. Local programs provide Operation Frontline's volunteer-led classes at after school programs, family support centers, Head Start agencies, health clinics, and other community nonprofits."
