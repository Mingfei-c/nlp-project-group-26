What Membership Fees \n        Will Pay For Short-Term Goals and \n      Activities: Meet the costs of \n      webcasting. Monthly costs of video and audio streaming, which \n      will grow as our web traffic increases. Continued web site \n      development. Upgrading this web site is critical to maintaining \n      its function and attracting an audience. Bring you new \n      programming , including more audio interviews, commentaries, and \n      news as well as videos from others and our own video productions. The Endangered Languages Project , which will bring \n      you the sounds and messages of languages threatened with extinction. Organize an Archaeological Field School for Teachers , \n      to promote and assist in the use of archaeology as a classroom teaching \n      tool. Work with partners, including teachers to \n      develop and deliver school curricula through The Archaeology \n      Channel . Write grant proposals to \n      secure support for TAC programs and development. Hire two or \n      three paid staff instead of relying completely on volunteer help. Buy a mini-DV video camcorder to play tapes for video \n      capture and encoding and for shooting our own video footage. Send a representative to regional and national \n      conferences to promote The Archaeology \n      Channel and develop partnerships that will bring you \n      valuable programming. Organize an Archaeological Film and \n      Video Festival . We have already begun preliminary planning for \n      this event, to be held in July of 2003. Some Longer-term Goals and \n      Activities: Establish a fund for sending a \n      videographer to important discovery locations to capture footage \n      you can see on The Archaeology Channel . Create virtual tours of important archaeological \n      sites (e.g., Pompei, Stonehenge, Mesa Verde) for you to see on The Archaeology Channel . Set up \n      webcams so you can watch ongoing archaeological excavations. Stream an indigenous-peoples radio station through The Archaeology Channel .
