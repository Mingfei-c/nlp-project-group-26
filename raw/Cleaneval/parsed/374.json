Do we need to accept the doctrine of rebirth in order to\r\npractice? Am I a 'second class' Buddhist if I don't meditate in my\r\npractice? Does eating meat implicate me in the killing? Q. I\r\nhave read statements attributed to some Buddhist teachers suggesting that\r\nvarious contemporary and historical examples of human suffering are the\r\nresult of the Karma of those who endure that suffering. Does this mean that\r\npeople who endure great suffering were deeply unskilful in previous lives and\r\nthat those who lead otherwise pleasant lives were skilful people, and if so how\r\nis Karma different from the ideas that underpin Caste structures? A .\r\nIt is believed as the general rule of the law of karma that we are bearing the\r\nfruit of our actions, whether the result of actions that bring fruit instantly, or\r\nactions at any time in the past, or actions in past lives. But always bear in\r\nmind that karmic law is not the simplistic two-dimensional principle that we\r\noften think it is. Karmic law is more often than not the expression of\r\nmulti-dimensional forces that mysteriously interpenetrate and is way beyond the\r\nmind's ability to comprehend. Caste systems are man\r\nmade, whilst the law of karma is an innate law of nature. Q. I\r\nattempt to sincerely practice the Dharma but have never been able to accept the\r\nidea of re-birth either in principle or as a matter of faith. I accept that\r\nthe nature of reality is not limited by my capacity to comprehend, but I cannot\r\nmake sense of the idea that we are reborn or experience re-becoming. Do you\r\nthink this is likely to undermine my efforts to practice and my spiritual\r\nprogress? Should I just sit with it and see'? A. I\r\ndon't think you have to make a problem out of it and feel that you are not practising\r\nproperly. Practice is about dealing with where your feet are at this very\r\nmoment, and therefore you could say that is all that is necessary. From my own\r\nexperience of getting to know myself over the years of practice, it became obvious\r\nthat, with all goes that to make me up, with my strong habits and powerful\r\nattachments, it would be quite absurd to imagine that they just materialised out\r\nof nothing at birth. You could argue these days that genetics may be an\r\nanswer, but there is a lot in me that cannot\r\nbe applied to that simple idea. And\r\nbesides, what creates the genetic map in the first place? In my own personal\r\npractice the idea of being born over and over again in the lottery of rebirth\r\nand suffering has always been a prime motivation to practice because of the consequences of my actions taught by Buddhism if I chose to\r\nignore them. To believe that life is a one off seems to me to negate the\r\nwhole motivation for Dharma\r\ncultivation. Yes, we could be motivated to do good for others and humanise our\r\nown conduct, but if it all comes to nothing in the end why should we put the\r\nextra effort into changing ourselves that Dharma practice demands? Definitely 'sit with it ',\r\nand if you are still enough you may well get to see the principle of becoming\r\nbeing created and acted out inside your own mind and body, and the continuous accumulation of karma which demands\r\nbecoming sooner or later. In the time that you have to wait for this\r\nunderstanding to show, take the leap and make room within yourself for the\r\nindispensable act of faith. Faith in the Buddha, the teachings, and all the\r\ngreat sages that have arisen throughout the ages, who\r\nhave continually reaffirmed this law. Allow this to support you\r\nin your practice. Q. How important is meditation in the spiritual life? The ground of my practice is\r\nto be found in ethics, and, given the emphasis on meditation, this sometimes\r\nhas the effect of making me feel like a second-class Buddhist. A. People\r\nwho have this idea that practice is all about sitting merely display their lack of understanding of the complete process that needs to be put in\r\nplace for the changes that practice brings about. Yes, you can say that of all\r\nthe parts that go toward make a\r\ncomplete practice, sitting meditation would be the most important part, but\r\nsitting will not reach its full potential without the support of the rest of the\r\neightfold path. So it is wrong to think that if you can't sit you can't practice. There are many people dedicated to\r\nDharma practice who have difficulty with sitting meditation. So\r\nrather than get\r\ndisheartened learn to focus on the rest of the path. Ethical practice is the\r\nobvious one to focus on, for it is the gateway into the Dharma. Come to realise that while you are refining this aspect of the path you are\r\ncultivating the mind in the same way as sitting practice. Restraining and containing\r\nactions, whether they are your thoughts, words or deeds, is possible only by\r\nself-awareness. Putting new thoughts, words and deeds into action is only\r\npossible with that same self-awareness. To do this you need application born of concentration and the understanding that\r\nyour unskilfulness needs to change. Is this not working with the eightfold path\r\nof sila, samadhi, and prajna? What meditation practice will bring to this is a\r\ndeepening of what you are already doing, but fundamentally there is no\r\ndifference. If you wish to come to\r\nmeditation sometime in the future, then adding a devotional practice to an\r\nethical one will help bring you more speedily to that roundedness. Devotional practice helps to soften the heart and\r\nintroduces us to the side of ourselves that we need to learn to get in contact\r\nwith in order for the deeper Dharma to arise. Devotional practice usually starts\r\nby projecting outwards to Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, but you should soon realise\r\nyour relationship with this form of external practice is very much conditioned\r\nby the inner relationship you have with yourself, and therefore should make you\r\nreflect more and more internally. Change that takes place in\r\npractice does not come from the head but rather from a part of us that we are\r\nfor the most part cut off from, that deep emotional seat buried within our body.\r\nIt is this that we need to become\r\nfamiliar with, and make friends with all that is contained there. There is\r\nlittle logic here. It takes faith\r\nand trust, becoming familiar with the reality of Dharma practice  which is\r\nthe willingness to surrender our profound attachment to the self that imprisons\r\nus in our head and creates the restlessness that prevents quiet meditation being\r\npossible. Devotional practice allows us to start that process of becoming\r\nwhole. By combining this with your developing ethical stability and skilful\r\nmeans born of self-awareness, you will be transforming the emotional and mental\r\nrestlessness that prevents you from sitting now. You will be laying the foundation for a fruitful sitting practice\r\nin the near future. Q .\r\nWould you agree with the view that buying meat and fish are the same as eating something that has been killed for you  meat and fish are made available for consumers. If you buy it and eat it\r\nthen all that you have done is avoided the messy business of killing by paying\r\nan anonymous person to do the work for you. So, doesn't buying meat and fish\r\namount in practice to the killing? A .\r\nThe Buddha wasn't a vegetarian, nor were his vast sangha, including countless\r\narhants who, like the Buddha, had finished their training and gone beyond the\r\ncreation of karma, reaching the pureness of thought, word and action. The\r\nnumerous traditions that sprang up in\r\nthe East over more than two thousand years since the Buddha have never\r\nbeen vegetarian, and I don't recall any of the prominent saints and sages of\r\nBuddhism saying that to follow the\r\nDharma you must be vegetarian. To suggest, as many do, in the West that\r\nthe first precept is violated by eating meat is to suggest that all those who\r\nhave practised traditional Buddhism, including the Buddha and the arhants, have\r\nbeen in violation of the first precept. I can best suggest you read the recent post\r\nconcerning vegetarianism for my general view on the subject. If you wish to create a\r\n'moral' view for vegetarianism (or anything else), then it should be based first\r\non the cultural background, and always be a personal view for you alone. Do\r\nremember, there will be many sincere\r\nspiritual people, and many\r\nfine human beings that don't have a spiritual path, who will disagree with\r\nwhatever new ideas you come up with. That's why if you really seek guidance as\r\nto what is right and wrong it is best to stay with rules that are part of\r\nthe natural laws that govern nature, which are always conditioned by the laws of\r\nkarma. If we decide to set up new\r\nideas and propagate them in the name of Buddhist\r\nmorality, we will be setting up a duality, which will always create\r\nproblems. This will inevitably\r\nbring conflict with those who disagree, thus\r\nviolating the basic spirit of Buddhism, which is to accept things the way\r\nthey are. Remember, never has there been a conflict in the name of Buddhism in\r\n2500 years; do you think that fine record is in place through mere luck?"
