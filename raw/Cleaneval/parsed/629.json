      "text": "Very \r\n\tImportant: On July 5th 2005 I filed a motion calling \r\n\tfor dismissal of my current criminal prosecution, because there are no laws establishing income tax \r\n\t\"crimes\".  To be thoroughly convinced of that, and also thoroughly \r\n\tconvinced that if there are criminals involved in income tax prosecutions, \r\n\tit can only be the federal judges and the justice department lawyers \r\n\tconducting such trials - Read \r\n\tthese 12 pages . My motion also \r\n\t\t\tprovides the legal basis for filing criminal charges (either \r\n\t\t\tpursuant to a criminal complaint or trying to get before a grand \r\n\t\t\tjury and seeking indictments) against judges and US attorneys who participate in such \r\n\t\t\tprosecutions, since in doing so they are actually engaged in criminal activity punishable \r\n\t\t\tby law. The information in \r\n\t\t\there is simple and irrefutable and reveals that the government \r\n\t\t\textraction of income taxes which has not only destroyed practically \r\n\t\t\tthe Nation's entire industrial base, (3rd world status, here we \r\n\t\t\tcome!), but it was done pursuant to a tax that has been extracted \r\n\t\t\tillegally and criminally - without practically anyone realizing it. These 12 pages explain it all .  \r\n\t\t\tDisseminate the information to as many people as possible, and try \r\n\t\t\tand get it before you local newspaper. Be sure to read the government's \r\n\tresponse .  Note that the government's response to all these issues \r\n\tis \"frivolous\" however  the government's response is criminal for the \r\n\treasons given in my motion. Notice the government makes no attempt to \r\n\taddress the fact that they can't produce any delegation of authority from \r\n\tthe secretary of the treasury delegating to the IRS the authority to collect \r\n\tincome taxes or it's publication in the federal register.  This of \r\n\tcourse demonstrates that the motto of the justice department which is \"not \r\n\tto gain a conviction, but to see justice done\" is so much BS.  In \r\n\treality they represent a greater collection of criminals than the people \r\n\tthey prosecute. Here are the Exhibits from that go with my latest motion above , \"Motion to Dismiss \r\n\tsince this court cannot have jurisdiction since the indictment fails to \r\n\tcharge an offense\" filed July 5, 2005."

      "text": "Since the income tax was repealed in 1954 when \r\nCongress adopted the 1954 Code, it is clear that for 50 years federal judges in \r\nconspiracy with U. S. Department of Injustice prosecutors have been illegally \r\nand criminally prosecuting people for crimes that do not exist in connection \r\nwith a tax that nobody owes. Therefore, the fact that Judge Dawson along with \r\nall of the Governments prosecutors in this case have been engaged in  the same \r\ncriminal conduct should surprise no one  except  in this case, their criminal \r\nconduct was so blatant and Judge Dawsons charge to the jury was so outrageously \r\nfalse in so many areas, that changes in the way criminal trials are conducted in \r\nthe U.S. of A. must inevitably follow from these disclosures. Pursuant to the Supreme Courts  definitive \r\nCheek decision, 498 US at page 201,  the government in a tax prosecution has \r\na three- fold  burden,  it must prove: (1) The law imposed a duty upon the \r\ndefendant; (2) The defendant knew of that duty; and (3) he deliberately and \r\nintentionally (willfully) violated that duty.  Notice that the issue of \r\nwillfulness only enters the picture in connection with the Governments third \r\nburden.   Obviously, a defendant has a right during the governments \r\npresentation of its case, to establish that no law imposed any such duty upon \r\nhim.  However to do that, the defendant must be able to raise the law itself and \r\nshow that no law imposed any such duty upon him, and that the IRS employees \r\nwho testified for the Government, had no legal authority to do what they \r\ntestified they did. If the defendant can establish these claims during the \r\nGovernments presentation of its case, and knock out all of the Governments IRS \r\nwitnesses (which can easily be done by introducing into evidence their job \r\ndescriptions, the significance of section 7608, and the nature of their pocket \r\ncommissions) \r\nthe defendant would be entitled to a direct verdict of acquittal at the close of \r\nthe Governments presentation of its case, without the defendant even having to \r\nput on a defense, largely based on the issue of willfulness. Therefore, how did Judge Dawson prevent me from \r\nproving that no income tax law imposed a duty upon me, and that I knew of such \r\na duty  thereby sparing the government the need of having to prove these \r\nfirst two elements of its burden, while preventing me from proving that none of \r\nthe Governments IRS witnesses had any legal authority to do what they testified \r\nthey did. Judge Dawson sought to accomplished these tasks in a variety of ways. The first way was to prevent me from bringing up the law itself, by continually \r\nclaiming that the law will come from the bench. How could I prove that no law imposed any duty upon me (and therefore I \r\nknew of  such a duty) if I could not bring up the law itself?    In fact \r\nwhen I asked Judge Dawson, if the Government intended to put on a witness who \r\nwould testify that the law imposed a duty upon me to pay income taxes,  David Ignall, the Governments lead prosecutor, specifically stated that the \r\nGovernment had no such intention of doing so, but would rely on the Judge \r\nDawsons jury instructions to establish these elements for the Government.   \r\nHowever, since I would never be able to cross-examine Judge Dawson concerning \r\nhis jury instructions, he would be free to misstate the law (he literally threw all law out the window as he misstated it at least two dozen times \r\n and such examples will follow) as he fabricated a duty that did not exist. Later, at a hearing (conducted outside the presence of the jury) involving his \r\nproposed jury instructions,   I specifically pointed out to him how numerous of \r\nhis proposed jury instruction misstated the law - but he gave those instructions \r\nanyway, although he did change a few, while he refused to give jury instructions \r\nthat correctly stated the law.   Since my objections and corrections were \r\nrecorded at that time, they will prove that Judge Dawson knew he was misstating \r\nthe law to the jury, if my objections are not edited out of the transcript. Apart from already explaining why the actions of \r\nJudge Dawson and the prosecutors constituted criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. 241 \r\nin the 12 page motion I filed on July 5, 2005 (and which is posted immediately \r\nabove this document) their criminal culpability was substantially extended at \r\ntrial and would now include the crime of obstruction of justice  as the \r\nfollowing will demonstrate. 1) Judge Dawson would not allow me \r\nto bring up the law, especially when it would impeach the testimony of \r\ngovernment witnesses. For example: a)  A government witness, with a very \r\nimpressive title, was introduced as being in charge of the frivolous penalty \r\nprogram in the 9th Circuit area.   She testified that the IRS imposed \r\nthe $500 frivolous penalty based upon guidelines established by the legal \r\ncounsel for the IRS, and when the IRS received a tax return that fell within \r\nthose guidelines, they imposed the $500 frivolous penalty.  I objected to her \r\ntestimony as hearsay, since she was not the one who determined whether a return \r\nwas frivolous or not, and what she was told by the IRS District Counsel \r\nconstituted hearsay. I stated that it was the IRS District Counsel who should \r\nbe testifying concerning what constituted a frivolous return, since he was \r\napparently the one who made that determination and not the witness who was now \r\ntestifying.  But my objection was overruled.   When I cross-examined her, I \r\nspecifically asked her whether or not any IRS agent took specific responsibility \r\nfor imposing the frivolous penalty.   And she again elaborated on how the \r\npenalty was imposed pursuant to guidelines set up by the IRS District Counsel.  \r\nTherefore, I again asked her if she was sure that the frivolous penalty was not \r\nimposed by IRS employees taking specific responsibility for imposing the \r\npenalty.  She \r\nsaid No, that was not how it was done.  I then asked her if she was familiar \r\nwith Code section 6751 I forgot whether she said Yes or No. In any case I \r\nasked her, If you saw a copy of IR Code Section 6751, would that refresh your \r\nrecollection? She must have said, Yes, since I now moved to admit Section \r\n6751 into evidence. I handed a copy of section 6751 to the U.S. attorney who was \r\nsitting right in back of me. He read it, but appeared to have a puzzled look \r\non his face, when he said, No objection. I then handed the document to the \r\nclerk, so it could be marked as an Exhibit, and she handed it up to Judge \r\nDawson, who proceeded to read it.   He read:  No penalty under this title shall \r\nbe assessed unless the initial determination of such assessment is personally \r\napproved (in writing) by the immediate supervisor of the individual making such \r\ndetermination or such higher level official as the Secretary may designate.   \r\nJudge Dawson, of course, realized that section 6751 (which provided that a \r\ndocument containing at least two signatures was required in order for the \r\nfrivolous penalty to be imposed) totally impeached the testimony of the \r\nGovernments witness then sitting before him.  Therefore, he sought to save the \r\ngovernments witness from being totally discredited by saying:   Well, courts \r\nhave held (of course, he never named what courts) that this provision is not \r\nreally binding on the IRS  (or words to that effect),   so this document is \r\nirrelevant and will not be admitted. So, Judge Dawson would not allow the \r\nlaw, section 6751,  to be admitted, since it would allow me to use it to \r\ndiscredit the entire testimony of this impressively titled,  government \r\nwitness.  Since she also stated (in order to establish her alleged credentials, \r\neven though the government would not qualify her as an expert)\r\n that she had testified extensively at both civil and criminal trials. It is, \r\ntherefore, apparent that at all such trials her testimony was in direct conflict \r\nwith the law  unfortunately defendants at such trials would probably be unaware \r\nof that fact. b)  One of the Government's first witnesses was \r\nretired Special Agent Ted Wethje.  He is mentioned in the Federal Mafia on pages \r\n221, 222, and 224 . The Government largely relied on his perjured testimony to \r\ngain my indictment and conviction in 1985 and therefore sought to use this \r\nexperienced and unconscionable liar at this trial.  He had absolutely no legal \r\nauthority to testify at either my 1985 trial or at this trial, since he has no \r\nmore authority to enforce the payment of income taxes than the man in the moon.  \r\nHe is precluded from doing so by his own job description (Exhibit A) and because \r\nhe falls into subsection (a) of provision 7608 (Exhibit C).   Any IRS agent who \r\nclaims he is legally authorized to carry a firearm must fall into subsection (a) \r\nof section 7608, since agents who fall into subsection (b) are not authorized to \r\ncarry firearms.   So, if Special Agent Wethje was authorized to carry \r\nfirearms during his employment with the IRS, he could only have been authorized \r\nto enforce the payment of liquor, tobacco, and firearms taxes and such other \r\ntaxes as fall within the provisions of subtitle E of the IR Code  and not \r\nincome taxes, which fall within subtitle A of the IR Code. So when I cross-examined him, the first thing I \r\nsaid to him was, Isnt it a fact Mr. Wethje, that when you worked at the IRS \r\nyou carried a firearm?   The government immediately objected to the question \r\n(probably citing relevance) and its objection was immediately sustained by \r\nJudge Dawson in the following manner, Sustained - move on.  However, I tried \r\nto argue that weather or not Wethje carried a firearm was relevant as to whether \r\nor not he was authorized to give testimony at this trial since it involved \r\nincome taxes.  However, Judge Dawson would hear none of it.  He supposedly had \r\nwarned me that when he sustained an objection, I was not to argue any further \r\nbut had to Move on.  However, I was also under the impression, that one had a \r\nright to argue the validity and necessity of the question you asked, before it \r\nwas ruled upon,  and in this case (as  well as in numerous other cases) Judge \r\nDawson ruled upon the Governments objection without giving me an opportunity to \r\nargue why the question was  relevant to my defense. Also I am hard of hearing, \r\nand so I might not have heard him say Sustained, but believed I still had a \r\nright to argue the validity of my question  and so might have raised arguments \r\nafter he had stated Sustained.   At such times Judge Dawson would bark,  \r\n Sanction, which meant I had just been held in contempt of court, which \r\ncarried a jail sentence that was double to that meted out by the previous \r\nsanction.  Judge Dawson started the sanctions at one day in jail, which were \r\nthen doubled for each succeeding sanction.  I must have received at least a \r\ndozen sanctions.  In any case, he also would not allow me to me bring up Wethjes job description, which also showed that Wethje had no authority to \r\ninvestigate anybody living within the continental U.S.A. in connection with \r\nincome taxes, and so he had no authority to be testifying at this trial.  In \r\nthis manner Judge Dawson knowingly allowed the Government to use witnesses \r\nagainst me who he knew had absolutely no authority to testify at my trial. C. \r\nAnother Government witness, \r\nRevenue  Officer Luddie Talley testified that he was involved (at various times) \r\nin seizing numerous items from me  including: an automobile, monies taken from \r\nme which were being held for me at the Clark County Jail, and 100% of my monthly \r\nSocial Security benefit.  He had sent the Social Security Administration a \r\nfraudulent, IRS notice-of- levy  (which he had no authority to send out, and \r\nwhich is totally benign and can be immediately thrown into the nearest trash \r\ncan) on which he had added, in his own handwriting, full levy;  a term that \r\nappears no place in  the law governing notices-of-levy. When I asked Talley, Are you aware of IRS pocket commissions?,  the \r\nGovernment cried out, Objection, which Judge Dawson Sustained as usual.   \r\nHowever, had I been permitted to proceed with this line of questioning, it would \r\nhave proceeded as follows.  Talley would have had to answer, Yes to my initial \r\nquestion. Based on that answer,  I  would then have said, And they consist of \r\nenforcement and non-enforcement commissions, do they not?  And he would have \r\nhad to say, Yes.  And then I would have said, And what kind of a pocket \r\ncommission do you have?   And he would have had to say, A non-enforcement \r\npocket commission.   And then I would have said, Therefore, you have no \r\nenforcement authority with respect to income taxes, isnt that correct?  In \r\norder not to commit perjury, he would have had to answer, Correct.  \r\nTherefore, I would have said, you had no lawful authority to seize my \r\nautomobile, the money being held for me at the Clark County Jail, or my monthly \r\nSocial Security check, isnt that correct?   And he would have had to answer, \r\nCorrect.  And then I would have said, So you are no better than an ordinary \r\nthief, except you operate under color of law, isnt that correct? And he would \r\nhave had to answer, Correct.  Except I would have corrected him, by saying.  \r\nNo, you are worse than an ordinary thief. Ordinary thieves at least dont have \r\nthe gall to pretend that their stealing is legal, and they, at least, take some \r\nrisk.  They dont have federal judges and U.S. attorneys protecting them.  \r\nBecause of the hypocrisy in your brand of thievery,  and because it receives the \r\nprotection of the courts and the DOJ,  it must be regarded as a lower form of \r\nthievery then that committed by ordinary criminals.   However, I never got the \r\nchance to proceed along those lines, since I was prevented from doing so by \r\nJudge Dawson. In addition, when I asked Talley, When you \r\nseize property do you do it legally or illegally? he responded by saying, I do \r\nit legally.  This laid the foundation for my next question, which was, Did you \r\never see a statute that allowed the IRS to seize property? However, before he \r\ncould answer, the Government objected and Judge Dawson gave his usual \r\nSustained.   If Talley had said Yes, to that question, I would have handed \r\nhim the Code and asked him to show me the statute that allowed him to seize \r\nproperty legally, and he would not have been able to find such a statute, \r\n because it doesnt exist.  If he said No, I would have asked, Then how do \r\nyou know you seize property legally?  So no matter how Talley  answered,  I \r\nwould have been able to expose the fact that IRS agents have no authority to \r\nseize property.  But, again, the Governments prosecutors and Judge Dawson \r\ninterceded in order to prevent me from proving that all IRS seizures are \r\nillegal, and not provided for by law. Further I produced a document sent out by the Social \r\n\tSecurity Administration that showed that the seizure of Social Security \r\n\tbenefits by the IRS is  limited to 15% (assuming they have any seizure \r\n\tauthority at all, which they do not have.)  However based upon \r\n\terroneous representations made by the Government, Judge Dawson instructed \r\n\tthe jury that the law allowed the IRS to seize 100% of my monthly benefit.   \r\n\tThat was dead wrong, but explaining it to the jury would have been too \r\n\tcomplicated, besides I had a better way to do it.  I was calling as a \r\n\twitness Dr. Raymond Hartman of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. His involvement in the movement even predates mine \r\n(See page 59 of The Federal Mafia.).  When he told me the IRS was taking 100% \r\nof his Social Security, I provided him with information which he sent to the \r\nSocial Security Administration.   Shortly thereafter they sent him a refund of \r\napproximately $9,000  and restored 100% of his monthly benefit.   Since I had to \r\nsupply Judge Dawson with an outline of what my witnesses were going to testify \r\nabout, he informed me that he would not permit Dr. Hartman to testify about \r\ngetting his Social Security benefits restored.  When I asked him why, he said \r\nthat such testimony had nothing to do with income taxes.   I am sure that the \r\nfact that Dr.  Hartmans  testimony would also refute what Judge Dawson had told \r\nthe jury concerning the IRSs legal authority to seize 100% of my Social \r\nSecurity benefits had nothing to do with his decision.."

      "text": "(d) Along the same lines, the Governments summary expert, IRS\r\n\r\nAgent \r\nClinton Lowder testified extensively \r\nconcerning deposits to my bank accounts which he claimed revealed that \r\nsubstantial amounts of money had been deposited to my eight bank accounts  in \r\nconnection with the years at issue.\r\n\r\nWhen I had previously inquired about the relevance of all his testimony regarding \r\n these bank deposits, the Government claimed that it was related to how much \r\nincome I had received during this period.  I said, no it didnt.   I pointed \r\nout that it merely indicated how much money I had deposited to my bank accounts \r\nand nothing more,  and depositing money to ones bank account is not a crime  \r\nnor had I been charged with any such crime.  Such deposits might be related to a \r\ncrime if I had been charged with money laundering, or selling products that were \r\nillegal.  I further pointed out that such  bank deposits could  not be \r\nconsidered as being indicative of the receipt of  income unless the Government \r\nput on an expert in the law, who would testify (and be subject to \r\ncross-examination) that deposits to ones bank accounts constituted the receipt \r\nof income within the meaning of Code Section 61. Since the Government had not \r\nput on any such expert witness (since they knew I would have eaten them up \r\nalive) they could not legally claim that mere bank deposits constituted  to\r\nany degree-   the receipt of income within the meaning of Code \r\nsection 61.   But Judge Dawson (illegally) did so anyway."

      "text": "In addition, when I cross-examined Mr. Lowder  I asked him, Isnt \r\nthe purpose of your analysis of my bank deposits an attempt on your part to \r\nestimate the amount of income taxes you believe I  omitted from the tax returns \r\nI filed for the years at issue?  I actually had to repeat that question three \r\nor four times before I got a straight answer from him.   When he finally \r\nadmitted that was the purpose of his activity,  I asked:  Isnt it a fact that \r\nsection 6201(2) (A) gives the Secretary the authority to estimate the amount of \r\ntaxes that have been omitted to be paid by stamp, but no law \r\nauthorizes the Secretary (or the IRS) to estimate the amount of taxes that has \r\nbeen omitted from an income tax return?  Objection! He is \r\nraising the law, your Honor.    Sustained. Move on.    But your Honor, I \r\nasked that question merely to show that the law does not allow Mr. Lowder to do \r\nwhat he claims he was doing. Mr. Schiff: you have deliberately violated my \r\norder that you are not to raise issues of law, nor argue with me when I sustain \r\na Government objection; therefore, you will be sanctioned for doing so. Of  course, no law authorizes the IRS (nor the Government at \r\ncriminal tax trials) to attribute to anyone more in income taxes than what they \r\nreported on their tax returns.  Therefore, seeking to pursue another tack, I \r\nsaid, Mr. Lowder, when you attempt to analyze a persons various sources of \r\nincome and possible deductions and seek to calculate a tax that is different \r\nfrom what that taxpayer reported on his return, do you do that legally or \r\nillegally?  I do it legally he immediately replied.   I was therefore poised \r\nfor my follow up question. Mr. Lawder, have you ever seen a statute that \r\nauthorized you to calculate a tax that is different from what a taxpayer \r\nreported on his return?   Objection  Sustained  But your Honor, I was \r\nonly.. Sanction. You are deliberately doing it again. In this way, Judge Dawson in criminal collusion \r\nwith the Government,  sought to prevent me from proving that no law authorized \r\neither the IRS,  Secretary of the Treasury (or his delegate), or the Justice \r\nDepartment in this prosecution,  to claim that I owed  more in income taxes than \r\nwhat I had reported on my zero returns for all of the years at issue. (f)  Therefore,  during the \r\npresentation of its case the Government did not put on one witness who would \r\ntestify that I had any income or income tax liability for any of the years \r\nat issue, or that anything (not one word, sentence, or phrase)  in any of my \r\nbooks and tapes (including my zero return) violated any law or encouraged \r\nanyone to violate any law  though such allegations were contained throughout \r\nthe indictment.  And though they had undercover agents at both of my last \r\nseminars (a two day seminar held in Las Vegas and a one day Seminar held in New \r\nYork City) they played no excerpts from either seminar as showing I had \r\nadvocated violations of law at either seminar  though such allegations were \r\ncontained in indictment. [6] And no less than  six  government witnesses testified that they could find no \r\nlaw  that made them liable for income taxes,  or required them to pay income \r\ntaxes, and at least four of them testified that they believed income, within  \r\nthe meaning of the IR Code,  meant  corporate profit.  In addition,  all three \r\nof my former employees who were witnesses for the prosecution testified that at no time did they, nor any of my other employees, ever \r\nbelieve that any of the material sold and sent out by Freedom Books  encouraged \r\nanyone to violate any law,  nor did I ever give them any reason to believe that \r\nI did  not hold my beliefs on taxes other than  sincerely and honestly.   In  \r\nshort,  the Government did not present a scintilla of evidence to support any of \r\nallegations contained in its indictment and we  should have gotten a direct \r\nverdict of acquittal at the close of the governments case. HOW JUDGE DAWSON SOUGHT TO \r\nOBSTRUCT JUSTICE BY PREVENTING  ME FROM PUTTING ON A DEFENSE Judge Dawson sought to prevent me from putting on an effective \r\ndefense, by: (1)  \r\npreventing me from calling \r\nwitnesses whose testimony was crucial to my defense; (2)  \r\npreventing me from testifying in \r\nthe most effective manner; (3)  \r\nby blatantly misstating the law in \r\nhis jury instructions, and (4)  \r\nby refusing to give a proper jury \r\ninstruction on the meaning of income and by refusing to give a jury \r\ninstruction that was favorable to my defense. The fact that Judge Dawson would actually prevent me from calling witnesses \r\nwhose testimony was material to my defense was totally shocking to many of those \r\nwho attended my trial, as well as the witnesses who would not be allowed to \r\ntestify in the manner we had intended.   For example, a key  theme that was \r\nrepeated throughout the indictment was that I had prepared false and fraudulent \r\ndocuments and gave tax advice to people which I well knew and believed was \r\nfalse.   Such claims made to the grand jury D.O.J. prosecutors knew were false, \r\nbut they wanted to get an in indictment and didnt care how many lies they had \r\nto tell to the grand jury to get it.   Proof of this is that at trial, no \r\ngovernment witness testified that anything I said or wrote about was untrue  \r\nlet alone that I believed it was untrue At \r\ntrial, I called as an adverse witness Special Agent  Sam Holland, who was the \r\nman most responsible for generating the indictment.  He was the one who \r\nillegally got the search warrant which was supported by his sealed affidavit \r\nthat accused me of everything but kidnapping the Lindberg baby.  In his sealed \r\naffidavit Mr. Holland accused me of filing false and fraudulent income tax \r\nreturns, and of encouraging others to do the same, and  instructing and \r\nassisting others to filefraudulent Forms W-4.  In The Federal Mafia \r\nI explain how to do both.  So, if my instruction were false, that  could easily \r\nbe established by turning to where such documents are discussed in The \r\nFederal Mafia.    However, when I called Sam Holland to the stand as an \r\nadverse witness and   I asked him if he had read The Federal Mafia,  \r\nhe said No. I had to ask him that question before I could ask him any question \r\nabout that book.  If he had answered yes, my next question would have been, \r\nCan you turn to any statement in that book that misstates the law or encourages \r\nanyone to violate the law?  However, I couldnt ask him that question, because \r\nhe now claimed  he had never read that book!    Here is the \r\nGovernments lead investigator supposedly gathering evidence to support all of \r\nthe charges in the indictment,  and he claims not to have read a book of mine \r\nthat the Government enjoined me from selling because it promoted violations of \r\nour tax laws  and he claims not to have that book??!!!  He undoubtedly poured over it, but  couldnt find anything in it that was untrue \r\nor encouraged people to violate the law.  Therefore, he had to give that absurd \r\nand unbelievable answer in order to avoid his total embarrassment if he were \r\nforced to answer what he knew was going to be my follow up question. In \r\naddition while he was on the witness stand I place a zero return in front of \r\nhim and asked him to identify one statement on it that was false, and he was \r\nunable to do so.  I believe the Government objected to my even asking him to \r\nso. The point is, a claim that is fundamental to \r\nthe governments entire case was its claim that I am essentially a liar and a \r\ncharlatan and simply do not believe what I say, write and teach in connection \r\nwith income taxes.   To refute such a claim, I was prepared to call no less than \r\nfive attorneys who have known me over the years and most of whom had represented \r\nme in various matters in connection with my stand on income taxes.   All of them \r\nwere prepared to testify that overlooking the legal validity of my beliefs on \r\nthe income tax,  they all believed beyond any question that I held those \r\nbeliefs honestly and sincerely.  Their testimony alone would have knocked the \r\nGovernments case into a cocked hat.  But Judge Dawson would not let them \r\ntestify.  Since California attorney Noel Spaid had already flown in, I put her \r\non as a character witness, but told the other lawyers they need not show up, \r\nsince they would not be allowed to testify. Also Judge Dawson would not allow the following persons to testify concerning \r\nhow they relied on my material and how I relied on research and in formation \r\nthey supplied to me: 1)    \r\nFormer IRS Special Agent Joe \r\nBannister 2)    \r\nFormer  IRS Revenue Officer  John \r\nTurner 3)    \r\nBob Schultz , Chairman of We the \r\nPeople 4)    \r\nThe Governments own clinical \r\npsychologist, Danial S. Hayes, Ph.D. L.L.C.                 whose analysis of me \r\nincluded the following: the research and \r\ndocumentation he believes to be in support of his beliefs, and the commitment and passion with \r\nwhich he holds his beliefs to be true. \r\n He appears to have extremely rigid, fixed, inflexible, doggedly, determined \r\nopinions and beliefs that cannot be changed by others reasoning. And, in \r\nthis case, even punishment has not had a corrective impact in his thinking or \r\nbehaviors. He appears impervious to any suggestion that he reconsider his \r\nconclusions or his actions, in part because of the thorough research \r\nhe has conducted which has yielded evidence and facts to support his \r\nconclusions, coupled with the fact that he considers himself to be an \r\nexpert with knowledge that supersedes that of any other individual claiming to \r\nhave expertise in this subject area. Most people have beliefs that have a \r\ngreater degree of flexibility and openness to change than does Mr. Schiff.  \r\nAlthough some may have beliefs that parallel Mr. Schiffs, they differ from him \r\nin that they are unwilling to jeopardize their freedom and suffer the \r\nconsequences of their beliefs to the degree that Mr. Schiff has. As a result, \r\nit would be almost impossible at this point in his life to persuade \r\nhim that he is wrong, particularly since he feels that there are few \r\nif any individuals who could match the breath and depth of knowledge he \r\nappears to have as a result of the time, effort, focus, and intellect he has \r\ndevoted to the subject. Any arguments against him are likely to be seen by \r\nhim as nave and sophomoric, and he is likely to dismantle any such arguments \r\nquickly and handily by quick reference to materials his opponent is unlikely to \r\nhave at the ready for consideration and rebuttal. He holds these beliefs with such conviction that even the severe consequences of incarceration for \r\nthe rest of his natural life fails to shake his resolve.  This \r\ndoes tend to set him apart from the average individualHe adamantly feels that \r\nhe has discovered something that is very important to the American people \r\nregarding this nations economic and taxation practices, and whereas others who \r\nare not driven by a Mood Disorder might be more open minded to arguments, weigh \r\npersonal consequences and elect not to pursue their campaign, Irwin Schiff has \r\nchosen a route fraught with significant and possible disastrous consequences. His analysis alone eliminated any claim of willfulness or that my \r\npast convictions were notice to me that wiped out willfulness which is what  \r\nthe Government continually repeated in its final argument to the jury.  Both the \r\nprosecutors and Judge Dawson knew that Judge Hayess report made such a claim \r\ntotally spurious. MORE TO FOLLOW: [1] The job description of Special Agents (Exhibit A) clearly reveals that \r\n\t\tthey have no authority to investigate the alleged income tax liabilities \r\n\t\tof persons residing within the continental USA;  Section 7608 (Exhibit \r\n\t\tB) reveals that the only IRS agents (subsection (b)) who might have \r\n\t\tauthority to enforce the payment of income taxes [which falls into \r\n\t\tsubtitle A] are those agents from the Intelligence  Division of the IRS \r\n\t\twhom the Secretary charges etc. etc. etc; however, the public never \r\n\t\tcomes in contact with such agents;  while those agents whom the public \r\n\t\tdeals with, Special Agents and Revenue  Officers,  must fall into \r\n\t\tsection (a) and, therefore,  can  only have authority to enforce the \r\n\t\tpayment of  subtitle E  taxes, such as liquor, tobacco and firearms. With respect to pocket commissions (Exhibit C): the IRS issues two \r\n\t\ttypes, enforcement and non-enforcement  commissions.  All IRS \r\n\t\tseizures are done by Revenue Officers who are only issued  \r\n\t\tnon-enforcement pocket commissions, which again  proves that they have \r\n\t\tno legal authority to seize anything, such as:  bank accounts, wages, \r\n\t\tautomobiles, stock portfolios, etc. etc. etc., which they seize every \r\n\t\tday.   Thus all IRS Revenue Officers are essentially thieves operating  \r\n\t\tunder color of law  whose thievery is protected by their partners in \r\n\t\tcrime, the federal judiciary and  DOJ lawyers. [2] However, as the following will show, only misstatements of law come from \r\n\t\tthe bench. [3] Since I could not get expedited transcripts of  the actual testimony \r\n\t\t(even though I was willing to pay extra for them) , these statements \r\n\t\trepresent my best recollection of what was actually testified to, since \r\n\t\tI do not, as yet,  have actual transcripts. [4] The Government never qualifies any of its witnesses as experts in tax \r\n\t\tlaw.   The Government does this deliberately, so that none of its \r\n\t\twitnesses can be cross-examined on the law itself.   However, their \r\n\t\twitnesses  continually testify about the law without appearing to do so \r\n\t\tand without their being subject to cross-examination on the laws they \r\n\t\ttestify about.   The government accomplishes this in the following \r\n\t\tmanner.   Government witnesses continually refer to such things as:   \r\n\t\tincome,  liability, deficiencies, levies, seizures as well as \r\n\t\tCDP hearings  books and records,  concealment  and even the \r\n\t\tfailure of the defendant  to cooperate with the IRS,  as if the IRS \r\n\t\tdid all of these things  legally  and the defendant was legally obligated  and subject to what these \r\n\t\tterms imply. However, all such terms involve a basis in law,  \r\n\t\tsuch as:  a statute (or the lack of a \r\n\t\tstatute) or, as in the case of income, a legal conclusion.  \r\n\t\tHowever, defendants are prevented from cross-examining Government \r\n\t\twitnesses  concerning:  (1) their use of these terms; (2) the \r\n\t\t legal basis of such  terms ;  and  (3) the substance of the  statutes in which these terms appear   because both the \r\n\t\tcourt and the Government will contend that since such witnesses  have \r\n\t\tnot been qualified as  experts in tax law, they cannot be \r\n\t\tcross-examined on the law. In this manner, the Government \r\n\t\tdeliberately and disingenuously has created a situation where it is able \r\n\t\tto use Government witnesses to casually (but effectively) testify about \r\n\t\tthe law, but make it impossible for defendants to impeach their  \r\n\t\ttestimony by cross-examining them on the laws they raise and refer \r\n\t\tto.   This diabolic scheme allows Government  witnesses to infer  that: (1) the actions and activities of the defendant are illegal \r\n\t\t(when they generally are not); (2) that the actions and activities of \r\n\t\tthe IRS are legal (when they generally are not);  and (3) \r\n\t\tallows Government witnesses (as well as the prosecutor and the court \r\n\t\titself) to use such terms as  income and  liability against \r\n\t\tdefendants, when such terms cannot apply to defendants  on any \r\n\t\tbasis. It should be noted \r\n\t\tthat even in this case, the Governments summary witness was  not \r\n\t\toffered as an expert in tax law.  He was offered only as an expert in \r\n\t\ttax calculations,  (whatever that means).  However, the Government \r\n\t\tsubsequently sought to sneak in his testimony as coming from an expert \r\n\t\tin income tax law.  However, I prevented this from happening.  I am \r\n\t\tsure the Government gets away with this at other tax \r\n\t\ttrials. [5] The Government sought  to mislead the jury concerning the purpose and \r\n\t\tnature of my bank accounts  seeking to create the impression that I \r\n\t\tused eight bank accounts to make my receipts less traceable. Mr. Lowder continually referred to transfers between  my eight bank \r\n\t\taccounts.  Actually I only had four accounts (plus my PILL account) at \r\n\t\tany one time.  When  the IRS illegally seized my bank accounts with Bank \r\n\t\tof America (and ATM withdrawals from my PILL account saved the day, \r\n\t\tbecause it allowed me to pay my employees and other creditors)   I \r\n\t\topened up accounts with the Nevada  State Bank because their Deposit \r\n\t\tAgreement said they would only turn over depositor funds pursuant to \r\n\t\tlegal process which eliminated IRS notices-of-levy (if their \r\n\t\tdifferences were pointed out to them.) However,  they have since \r\n\t\tchanged their Deposit Agreement to  make it more compatible for them to \r\n\t\tillegally honor IRS notices -of -levy, which doing so, is still a \r\n\t\tviolation of Nevada State law.  In any case, two of the four accounts \r\n\t\twere for the Freedom Foundation.  One account was interest bearing, the \r\n\t\tother was not.   I kept funds not immediately needed in the interest \r\n\t\tbearing account, and transferred funds to the non interest bearing \r\n\t\tchecking account as needed.  The two accounts I had for Freedom Books \r\n\t\tconsisted of a merchant account and my general checking account.  The \r\n\t\tmerchant account is where credit card receipts are automatically \r\n\t\tdeposited by the company handling those funds, while checks and other \r\n\t\treceipts are deposited directly into the checking account. So there was \r\n\t\tnothing devious or shady about having these four accounts (or the eight \r\n\t\tthe Government kept referring to) as the Government sought to \r\n\t\tdepict. [6] In addition, throughout the indictment I am accused of knowing and \r\n\t\tbelieving that practically everything I teach and write about the \r\n\t\tincome tax I know to be false.  Can you believe it?"

My Memorandum \r\n\tof Law argues that all such IRS searches and seizures  are illegal on a variety of grounds , which (if my arguments are correct), means that \r\n\tuntold numbers of Americans have been prosecuted and convicted based upon \r\n\tillegally acquired evidence. On December 21, 2004, U.S. Magistrate Judge \r\n\tLawrence R. Leavitt filed his Report , \r\n\tcontesting my claim and recommending that U.S.D.C. Judge Kent J. Dawson deny \r\n\tmy \" Motion \r\n\tto Suppress \".  To read my reply to his report click here . Apart from the federal \r\n\tgovernment filing criminal charges against me, it also filed a civil lawsuit \r\n\tagainst me seeking to reduce to judgment some $2.4 million in income taxes, \r\n\tfraud and interest penalties it claimed I owed for the years 1979-1985. As I \r\n\targue in my pleadings, I do not  owe the Government ONE DIME for any \r\n\tof those years. The government sought to reduce to judgment assessments \r\n\t(which I claimed were both fraudulent and time barred) it had made against \r\n\tme for those years. The actual taxes I allegedly owed for those years \r\n\tamounted to about $300,000.   The government now seeks to extract from me an \r\n\tamount in taxes and penalties that would exceed IN \r\n\tMULTIPLES what I could have conceivably grossed for those years. What medieval tyrant ever \r\n\tsought to extract from a conquered enemy far more in tribute than the \r\n\tvanquished nation could conceivably possess? But \r\n\tthe pleadings I filed in this case, reveal, I suggest, why federal courts \r\n\tdo not have subject matter jurisdiction to proceed against anyone either criminally or civilly in connection with income taxes. The taxes I allegedly owe for 1980-1985 were based on coerced tax returns I filed during a \r\n\tcontrived probation violation hearing in the hopes that they would save me \r\n\tfrom being sent back to jail for allegedly violating the terms of my \r\n\tprobation  which would be completed in only a week or so. (See The \r\n\tFederal Mafia pp 281-283 for a full explanation) The taxes I allegedly owe for the 1979 are based upon a sham Tax Court determination \r\n\t(See The Federal Mafia pp 260-263 ), but were, in any case, no \r\n\tlonger collectable, as explained in my Rule 59 pleading.  In any case, for a \r\n\tvariety of reasons, I was entitled to have an impartial jury decide \r\n\tthe entire matter. Instead, the government moved for a summary judgment, so \r\n\tthe controversy could be settled, not by an impartial jury, but by a lone \r\n\tfederal judge, who could be expected to be less impartial than a jury of \r\n\tprivate citizens.  Time and again federal courts have ruled that when a \r\n\tconstitutional right collides with the governments alleged need \r\n\tfor revenue, it is the constitutional right that must yield. On June 13, 2004 U.S. \r\n\tFederal Judge, Philip M. Pro granted the government its summary judgment. In \r\n\tmoving for summary judgment the government literally buried me in a variety \r\n\tof legal pleadings and documents, which had to be addressed if I were to \r\n\tdefeat its motion. Eventually, I discovered that: (1) the statute the \r\n\tgovernment used to impose the fraud penalties could \r\n\tnot apply to me on any basis, and (2) Judge Pro had based his \r\n\truling on a legal assumption that simply could \r\n\tnot apply in this case . Therefore, \r\n\this summary judgment in my view is clearly void as a matter of law \r\n\tjust on these two grounds alone . Both issues \r\n\tare fully set forth in the documents that I have now posted to this website. Since I believe that Judge \r\n\tPros ruling is erroneous on a variety of grounds, on July 20, 2004 I \r\n\tmoved that he alter, amend, or vacate his ruling pursuant to a Rule 59 \r\n\tmotion. On September 3, 2004, I filed another motion requesting that he \r\n\tdismiss the governments lawsuit altogether because I believe he lacked subject matter jurisdiction to even hear this case On August 13, 2004 the government answered my Rule 59 Motion .  I Replied on September 3rd ( click \r\n\there for my Reply ). On September 16, the Government answered my motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction , \r\n\twhich I answered on September 3, 2004. ( Click \r\n\there for my answer ) On January 18, 2005 U.S. District Judge Philip M. Pro denied without comment, my rule 59 motions , and also denied without comment my motion in connection with his alleged lack of \r\n\tjurisdiction .  Since he gave no reasons to support these decisions, on \r\n\tJan 27th, 2005 I filed a motion requesting  Findings of Fact and \r\n\tConclusions of Law.  In any case, I have already served notice that I am \r\n\tappealing both of his rulings to the 9 th Circuit Court of \r\n\tAppeals. Read my \r\n\tappeal. All of \r\n\tthis information can be accessed by clicking the items listed below. In addition I have filled numerous other pleadings in connection with the above litigation.  I am in the process of posting \r\n\tthese additional pleadings and the governments responses to this web site. \r\n\t To get to these pleadings and to find out how the government and the court \r\n\tmay have responded click here .

      "text": "Getting back to Judge Lloyd D. Georges Preliminary \r\n\tInjunction,  it appears from his Order and other statements he made at the \r\n\tPreliminary hearing that if I cut out certain pages from The Federal Mafia: How The Government Illegally \r\n\tImposes and Unlawfully Collects Income Taxes, I might be able to \r\n\tsell a sanitized version. Apparently by \r\n\tadvertising other books and tapes in the back of  this book I converted the \r\n\tbook  to commercial speech, thus denying it 1 st Amendment \r\n\tprotection. (Does this make sense to anybody?) Therefore, for now, Freedom Books will only sell my other \r\n\tbooks and such related books as: (1) the Internal Revenue Code (unless I am \r\n\tenjoined from selling that too); (2) Title 28; (3) 26 C.F.R, a 5-volume \r\n\tset;  (4) Sen. William V. Roths book, The Power to Destroy (Its dust \r\n\tjacket claims that the book contains Shocking revelations about the \r\n\tIRS[such as]  How the IRS  with near absolute authority granted by \r\n\tCongress  plays judge, jury, and executioner, depriving countless taxpayers \r\n\tof basic rights.) It was Roths Senate Committee that investigated the IRS in \r\n\t1997 and uncovered wide scale IRS abuse of taxpayers); and (5) the book \r\n\tFundamentals of Litigation For Paralegals. (Incredibly, the government has \r\n\tpassed a law that compels all Americans to acquire the litigating skills of \r\n\tprofessional lawyers.  How else can you fight the deprivation of your \r\n\trights that Senator Roth speaks about?)  I will also still sell (for $5.00) \r\n\tmy color - coded Guide to the Constitution of the United States and \r\n\tDeclaration of Independence. One cannot help but feel a twinge of \r\n\tnostalgia upon reading the Constitution, since it poignantly reminds us of \r\n\tdays gone by.  All of these books are available on my Online Store . It's also important to note that in my appeal to \r\n\tthe 9 th Circuit my lawyer did not argue the merits of my \r\n\tbeliefs.  He could only argue that regardless of what my book said, it was \r\n\tprotected by the 1 st Amendment. If he argued the merits of my \r\n\tbeliefs he would have been sanctioned by the court, since my beliefs are not \r\n\tin accord with what \r\n\tappellate courts have ruled our tax laws say, and lawyers are apparently \r\n\tbound by what appellate courts say the law is   and cannot argue otherwise. This is one of the reasons I am representing myself in my \r\n\tpending criminal trial since no lawyer can argue the merits (if any) of my \r\n\tincome tax beliefs in federal courts or they will be sanctioned. Along these lines, I cannot see how my beliefs on income \r\n\ttaxes can mislead anyone.  Apart from checking my beliefs against the law \r\n\titself - would I sell the Internal Revenue Code if it contradicted what I \r\n\tsay in my books?  - all of my books cite numerous court decisions:  over 100 \r\n\tsuch decisions are cited in \"The Federal Mafia\" alone. However, not only am I posting Judge Lloyd D. Georges entire \r\n\t35 page Preliminary Injunction to this website (as he ordered me to do), \r\n\twhich contains his analysis as to why Cindy Neun, Larry Cohen and myself \r\n\tprepared false tax returns and other tax-related documents (because) \r\n\tThese returns and documents falsely report that their customers have no \r\n\ttaxable income and no tax liability. (Page 13)  In addition, I have also \r\n\tposted to this website numerous Responses from different sets of Justice Department lawyers who also argue and contest my views regarding the meaning of  income and whether or \r\n\tnot there is a law making anyone liable for income taxes. In addition I have also posted  three Reports and \r\n\tRecommendations from U.S. Magistrate Judge Lawrence R. Leavitt who also \r\n\targues that  my views on these issues are dead wrong . Therefore, in view of all these official, legal voices all \r\n\texplaining  on this website - why my views on income taxes are dead wrong , how can anyone be misled by me? I urge everyone to read all of the pleadings now posted to \r\n\tthis website filed by U.S. attorneys and the court all claiming that my \r\n\tunderstanding of our income tax laws is dead wrong . \r\n\t (More such  pleadings and documents  will be posted to this web site as \r\n\tthey become available)  I, therefore, urge everyone to: (1) check out the \r\n\tInternal Revenue Code itself; (2) consult with your lawyer and/or accountant \r\n\tconcerning any and all material contained on this website and anything I \r\n\tmight have written and said about income taxes; and (3) ask the IRS itself, \r\n\tbefore you rely on anything I might have said or written in connection with \r\n\tincome taxes. Remember, all federal judges and U.S. attorneys maintain that \r\n\tmuch of what I say about income taxes is dead wrong , \r\n\tand in many cases, might even constitute tax evasion.  I, of course, do not \r\n\tagree with that, since I would never advocate violations of law  which is \r\n\twhy I sell the law and its implementing regulations. However, I may even be \r\n\tdelusional, so dont take my word for anything , \r\n\twithout checking out all of the underlying facts and what the IRS, the DOJ, \r\n\tand the courts  have to say about the matter. On pages 33  35 of the Preliminary Injunction you will find \r\n\tall the things I have been ordered to do by the Court.   Remember, I am \r\n\tappealing the constitutionality of this Injunction to the Supreme Court and \r\n\thopefully that Court will accept certiorari. For those of you who would like to help me make that voyage \r\n\tto the Supreme Court so I can attempt to salvage that portion of the 1st \r\n\tAmendment that guarantees freedom of speech, and of the press, \r\n\tcontributions for that voyage  will be gratefully accepted since if I allow this Injunction to stand, the 1 st Amendment is effectively dead in America. The briefs we filed on this \r\n\tissue with the 9 th Circuit Appeal will shortly be posted to this \r\n\tweb site. Also Judge Lloyd D. Georges Preliminary Injunction order, \r\n\twas based on a hearing in which the government did not put on one witness \r\n\tthat I could cross-examine.  I, on the other hand, demanded to be put under \r\n\toath and challenged the government to cross-examine me and identify any \r\n\tpassage in any of my books that encouraged people to break the law.  They \r\n\trefused to do so even though I offered to (1) stop selling all of my books; \r\n\tand (2) not oppose their Injunction if they did so.  You can listen to the \r\n\t2- hour hearing by clicking here . The primary reason t he \r\n\tgovernment gave, for banning The Federal Mafia was that it contains \r\n\tinformation on how to file a zero return. The government claimed that my \r\n\tzero return promoted tax evasion and was somehow tied in to commercial \r\n\tspeech, therefore; The Federal Mafia was not protected by the 1st \r\n\tAmendment.  However, I have now posted the zero return I personally filed \r\n\tfor the year 2003 on this website.  Therefore, anyone can have the \r\n\tinformation free of charge . So, where is the commercial speech? I have \r\n\talso posted to this website a wage statement that shows how the IRS \r\n\t(actually the U.S. Government) goes about confiscating 90% of a persons \r\n\twages without hearings or court orders of any kind. Is this the action of a \r\n\tgreat nation? If you'd like to help rid America of this economically destructive and \r\n    illegally enforced tax, help disseminate these pleadings far and wide. \r\n    The Government and all of its minions obviously are trying to crush me in \r\n    order to prevent me from informing and educating the American public \r\n    concerning how it illegally and destructively collects income taxes  and \r\n    what the public might do to protect itself. Besides having unlimited \r\n    manpower to come at me, the Government also has a printing press which \r\n    allows it to (illegally) print as much fiat currency as it needs to do the \r\n    job. I, of course, have no such printing press. All I have to fight with is \r\n    truth, and whatever energy I can muster at age 76. However, fighting the Government both civilly and criminally takes both time \r\n    and money. So if you would like to help me financially fight a Government \r\n    whose lawless enforcement of the income tax has literally bankrupted this \r\n    Nation , and converted it into being the worlds biggest debtor Nation, while \r\n    destroying its railroads, shipping lines, and most of its factories, you can \r\n    mail contributions to Freedom Books, 444 East Sahara, Las Vegas, Nevada \r\n    89104. Or buy copies of the books and research from Freedom Books . However, not only has the federal government been illegally collecting \r\n    income taxes, as is clearly shown in the documents now posted to this web \r\n    site, but it has been the lawless, irresponsible and destructive collection \r\n    of this tax that is responsible for the disappearance of practically \r\n    Americas entire industrial base and our total dependence on foreign capital \r\n    to fund federal deficits. Where 50 years ago practically all the products \r\n    Americans used and wore were made in America, almost nothing we use or ware \r\n    is made in America today.  And it is not cheap foreign labor that has \r\n    driven American jobs overseas, but the Governments destructive economic and \r\n    fiscal policies (pushed by both Democrat and Republican administrations) \r\n    that have done it. I saw this happening 30 years ago, which is why I wrote The Biggest Con: How \r\n    the Government is Fleecing You . The last two chapters of that book are \r\n    entitled, The Decline of U.S. Economic Power  How the Government and the \r\n    Federal Reserve Arranged It and The Solution to Americas Economic and \r\n    Social Problems. A more simplified version is covered in How An Economy \r\n    Grows and Why It Doesnt, published in 1985. The solution to the problem of job loss in America and outsourcing is the \r\n    same today as it was when I focused on the problem some 30 years ago. Lou \r\n    Dobbs of CNN has been talking about this problem for months. So I \r\n\tsent him an e-mail on the subject, since none of his guests appeared to have \r\n\ta clue as to why this is happening and what we should do about it. Read my economic \r\n\tcommentary to Lou Dobbs .  \"When will Lou Dobbs get it right?\". Why not write or e-mail Lou Dobbs and ask him to have me on his show, since \r\n    its about time the American public heard someone on network TV who knows \r\n    something about the problem; why it developed, and what steps the Nation \r\n    must take if the problem is to be solved, if it is not already too late. Purchase my books, research and other information now for there is no \r\n    guarantee that the 9th Circuit will reverse its Opinion sustaining the First \r\n    Amendment injunction. Get all of the truth while you still can. Welcome to Amerika. [1] For all practical purposes, the income tax started in 1943 when the \r\n    Government instituted the withholding tax as a temporary, wartime measure \r\n    and called it a Victory Tax. Congressmen would have risked being lynched \r\n    had they attempted to pass a law, during peacetime that took taxes out of \r\n    the paychecks of working Americans. However, with 10 million Americans under \r\n    arms and numerous servicemen dying everyday, how could those on the home \r\n    front object to a Victory Tax? In this manner, Congress was able to pass a \r\n    tax that was unconstitutional on a variety of grounds, (for one such \r\n    surprising ground See the Federal Mafia - PP159-161 ), and the federal \r\n    government has been growing like a cancer ever since. 50 years ago \r\n\tAmericans generated the savings needed to fund federal deficits. But for a \r\n\tnumber of years, the government has been  encouraging Americans  to spend \r\n\t(and not save), since this is how  government statisticians and economists \r\n\t(idiotically) measure American prosperity, not by how much Americans \r\n\tproduce and save, but how much Americans  spend and consume.  However, when \r\n\tAmericans spend, practically all the products they now buy are manufactured \r\n\tin foreign countries.  Therefore, American consumer spending does not enrich \r\n\tAmericans, it enriches those foreign workers who produce the products that \r\n\tAmericans now buy. Therefore, when \r\n\tour government needs money to fund its deficits, it cant look to Americans, \r\n\tsince Americans are hard at work spending not saving. Therefore, our \r\n\tgovernment now has to rely on foreigners to fund its deficits.   So, where \r\n\tonce American factories produced the consumer goods that gave America the \r\n\tworlds highest standard of living, and where its economy  generated the \r\n\tsavings needed to finance federal deficits, today the American economy \r\n\tproduces neither. America, thanks to \r\n\tfederal programs designed to promote: The New Deal, The Fair Deal, The \r\n\tGreat Society, The New Frontier, and the Welfare State, (all variations \r\n\tof socialism) have resulted in America now becoming totally dependant on: (1) the consumer goods produced by foreigners (and their \r\n\twillingness to ship them to us on credit), and (2) the willingness of \r\n\tforeigners to lend us their money, so our federal government can pay its \r\n\tbills.  What  happens to the American standard of living (to say nothing of \r\n\tAmericas ability to wage war) when foreign nations no longer want to do \r\n\teither?  So, Americas once great, economy, which took past generations of \r\n\tproductive Americans approximately 300 years to build (under a free \r\n\tenterprise system which no longer exists here),  Washington D.C. \r\n\tpoliticians  managed to destroy in approximately 50 years of meddling.  \r\n\tTragically,  the day must inevitably arrive when somebody will write a book \r\n\tentitled, The Rise and Fall of America.
