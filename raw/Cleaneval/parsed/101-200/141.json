It makes no difference\r\nwhether Congress does it or whether the neighborhood bully does it."

Just\r\nconsider — what is the \"income\" of a traveling salesman who has to pay his\r\nown expenses? Is it his paycheck? Or is it his paycheck after deducting his\r\nexpenses? What about his meals?"

Perhaps each child in school takes an apple for the teacher\r\nfrom the fruit section.  Is that part of \"income\"? What is the income of a coal miner, copper miner, or oil producer,\r\nwho may sell coal, ore, or crude oil but in the process the mines or wells\r\nslowly become exhausted? Are they entitled to deduct from their gross revenue\r\nsome part for this depletion, the same way that an automobile dealer deducts\r\nthe amount he paid the factory for your new car before he sold it to you? One definition that economists like to use for income is the change\r\nin your wealth from one point in time to another.  Of course, this idea is\r\njust as fuzzy as the original notion, because nobody can define \"wealth\"\r\nin any clear way.  Is it the market value of all your property?  Does it\r\ninclude the stored-up potential value of your training and education?  Is\r\nyour native intelligence — or the guidance from your parents that helped\r\nyou develop good attitudes toward work — a part of your \"wealth\"? The problem of attempting to measure income is one of the main defects\r\nin an income tax.  Of course, the Internal Revenue Service loves this particular\r\ndefect, because it can make all kinds of complex and obscure rules to audit\r\nthe traveling salesman, the mom-and-pop grocery, and the coal miner.  Farmers\r\nhave a really good thing going for them.  Most farmers can hide the distinction\r\nbetween family consumption and business expenses without even thinking about\r\nit.  The I.R.S. has an entire special set of rules to audit farmers, most\r\nof whom don't have \"income\" at all. If you try to picture someone's \"income\" as a river that is flowing\r\nacross his property, you can see the analogy with the weekly paycheck.  The\r\nriver might flow at a rate of a thousand gallons per hour.  Your paycheck\r\nmight arrive at the rate of $300.00 per week.  The income tax, however, is\r\nimposed on your annual income.  The process of taking something that flows\r\nover time and lumping it into a fixed total at the end of a period of time\r\nis a major defect in the income tax.  Should the tax be the same on someone\r\nwho earns $300.00 per week for 52 weeks as for someone who only works for\r\n13 weeks in the summer at $1200.00 per week and spends the winter on a Caribbean\r\nisland? Their annual incomes are the same. Many people believe that a person's \"income\" is somehow related\r\nto his standard of living.  The argument is that \"equity\" requires that people\r\nwho have a higher standard of living should pay more in taxes than people\r\nwho have a lower standard of living.  Take two people, however, who receive\r\nan equal amount of money on January 1st.  Assume that one of them goes to\r\nLas Vegas and has a jolly good time eating and drinking, losing all his money\r\nat the tables, and enjoying live entertainment.  Assume the second person\r\ntakes the same amount of money and builds a school for orphans. Aside from the fact that both started with the same amount of cash,\r\nand each chose to spend it voluntarily in different ways, what kind of argument\r\ncan pretend that their standard of living is the same?  Perhaps the benefactor\r\nof the orphans was a lonely old woman who lives in a one-room apartment with\r\nthree cats.  Perhaps the high-roller in Las Vegas is a blue-collar worker,\r\ndying of cancer, who took his entire pension benefit in a lump sum to enjoy\r\nit before he dies. It is irrational to attempt to \"measure\" the amount people should\r\npay in taxes according to sociological criteria.  People who regularly put\r\nlarge amounts of their \"income\" or \"wealth\" into savings and investments\r\nhelp to create jobs and furnish modern tools and technology to workers, who\r\nthen become more productive and earn higher wages.  How does the concept\r\nof \"income\" or \"wealth\" fit the model of the high-roller in Las Vegas and\r\nthe lonely old woman, who might in fact be a millionaire's widow?  There\r\nis no justification for taxation according to \"ability to pay\" or \"standard\r\nof living.\"  All taxation is arbitrary and punitive."

This is no longer true — because of the income tax."

If he wants\r\nto save part of his money to invest in a business, or perhaps start a new\r\none, his only funds available are those left after taxes.  People with savings\r\nto invest who don't want the risks of starting their own business may invest\r\nin the financial markets, or the financial institutions; but any interest\r\nor dividends earned are reduced annually by the income tax, so they can't\r\nkeep reinvesting to accumulate capital.  Ask any accountant about compound\r\ninterest:  the difference is dramatic when you see the comparison between\r\na tax-free investment and an investment with yearly taxes deducted! On the other hand, some of America's upper-class or aristocratic\r\nfamilies, whose grandfathers built their fortunes in the days before there\r\nwas an income tax, enjoy a standard of living that our hypothetical young\r\nman could achieve only with a lot of lucky breaks and hard work.  This is\r\nno reason, of course, to impose punishments on the people who already have\r\nproperty — we believe in the right to private property — but it is a compelling\r\nreason to abolish the discriminatory income tax that makes it almost impossible\r\nfor most Americans today to accumulate any!  All spending and taxation by\r\ngovernment reduces capital formation and lowers the living standard of everyone,\r\nespecially the weaker members of society. If a majority feel anger or annoyance because some people receive\r\nwelfare benefits from government, financed by income taxes according to the\r\nMarxist principle, \"from each according to ability, to each according to\r\nneed,\" they should look at the system of incentives as the welfare recipients\r\nsee them.  If someone on welfare decides to get a job and his employer deducts\r\ntaxes, not only will he most likely lose his welfare benefits, but he will\r\nbe surrendering part of his gross pay to the government for FICA and personal\r\nincome taxes.  In many cases, when he looks at the net benefit of working\r\n-vs- welfare, taking both the wages received and the welfare benefits lost,\r\nthe effective tax rate on the first few thousand dollars of earned income\r\nis greater than 50 percent! When you add to this disincentive the fact that unskilled workers\r\noften have to take unpleasant jobs, the reason why so many people choose\r\na life of unemployment is not hard to understand.  This is not to say that\r\nsuch people are making a happy choice, however, as the high incidence of\r\nalcoholism and drug abuse among the unemployed indicates.  The taxation of\r\n\"income\" is just one more barrier to the development of a productive and\r\nmeaningful life in our modern society."

      "text": "he modern income tax is supposed to be based on the taxpayer's \"ability to\r\npay.\"  This is one reason why the rates are higher on larger incomes.  The\r\nsimple idea is that for a person whose \"income\" may be only a few dollars,\r\none extra dollar is somehow more important than an extra dollar to a millionaire.\r\n Yet, it is impossible to compare the relative values of something like \"one\r\ndollar\" to two individuals in a purely abstract way.  What if the poorer\r\nperson is a Catholic monk, living in a monastery; what if the wealthier person\r\nis attempting to raise sufficient funds to pay for a kidney transplant for\r\nhis child? There is no system for making value judgements about different\r\nincrements of \"income\" to different people — so it is just a manifestation\r\nof hate and envy in our political system to tax different levels of \"income\"\r\nat different rates."

      "text": "In the 1930s, when steep, progressive tax rates were imposed for\r\nthe first time, politicians were using the spectre of evil businessmen as\r\na scapegoat for the Depression.  The slogan was \"Soak the Rich.\"  Most voters\r\nwent along with the comedy, never dreaming that by the 1970s everybody above\r\nthe poverty level would be paying \"rich people's\" tax rates.  History records\r\nmany cases like this, where the frog in the pot of tepid water that slowly\r\ndies as the temperature rises was the same creature who turned on the gas\r\nin the first place.  Anew generation of American \"frogs,\" however, can turn\r\noff the gas!  The belief in \"evil wealth\" is just so much fuel for envy. The different tax rates for different amounts of \"income\" are also\r\nthe fundamental reason why the tax code is so complex that most people need\r\nhelp to prepare their tax returns.  Businessmen have to pay for professional\r\naccountants and tax lawyers, just to comply with a law that confiscates their\r\nworking capital if they pay some invoices in January instead of December.\r\n Why do some wealthy physicians and attorneys take long vacations in December,\r\nor ask their clients to pay them in January, or tell their stockbrokers to\r\nsell things that have gone down in value around Christmas time? How much\r\ninefficient or irrational economic activity is based on the absurdities of\r\nthe tax code? Remember the analogy of the river?  With a progressive income tax,\r\nit makes a big difference from one year to the next how you can make that\r\nriver appear to flow, even though in reality it may not change at all.  When\r\ntax rates go up or down, people jump through hoops to get their incomes or\r\ndeductions timed in the best year.  If \"tax indexing\" is introduced, supposedly\r\nto correct \"bracket creep\" (another vicious consequence of different rates\r\nfor different nominal incomes) the game of switching the timing of your income\r\nwill become even more widespread.  Accountants and lawyers — and I.R.S. investigators\r\n— will have more work to do, and will enjoy a larger share of everyone else's\r\nproductivity. Best of all, from the standpoint of the totalitarians in the Federal\r\ngovernment, is the complexity of the tax code — due entirely to their power\r\nto define \"income\" in an arbitrary manner.  Economists cannot even identify\r\nincome rigorously; accountants cannot even measure \"income\" except by arbitrary\r\nconventions, and they can interpret it in different ways at different times.\r\n When both the concept and the definition are vague and arbitrary, the Rule\r\nof Law vanishes!  How can you obey a law when you cannot understand it? \r\nThe courts tell you that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  Catch 22. Many people who suffer from high taxation become hostile to others\r\nin the economy because there is a perception that others aren't paying their\r\n\"fair share.\"  How often have you heard the self-deception, \"Iwouldn't mind\r\npaying my taxes if everybody else paid their fair share.\" Nobody knows what\r\nthe \"fair share\" of others might be, but because their own taxes are too\r\nhigh, instead of getting angry at Congress or the I.R.S., their political\r\nenergy is diffused at some abstract \"others\" who aren't \"paying their fair\r\nshare.\"  This is the kind of mass confusion that governments have always\r\nused to prevent revolutions! Make the peasants suspicious of each other!\r\n When one of the peasants is cut from the mob and burned at the stake, all\r\nof the rest of them will cheer! Are you tired of being played for a sucker by this game of secret\r\nlaw?  Are you tired of knowing that if \"they\" really want to \"get you,\" no\r\nmatter whether it is for your unpopular opinions or your race or religion,\r\nall \"they\" have to do is look up your number and call you in for an audit!\r\n Worst of all, we live in constant fear of \"them\" — as if we had no rights!\r\n The Sixteenth Amendment is a contradiction to the rest of the Constitution,\r\nand a contradiction in our fundamental law will lead inexorably to its complete\r\ndestruction."
