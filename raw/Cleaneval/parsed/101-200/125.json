OBJECTIONS RAISED OVER NEW TELCO PRODUCT BROADBAND BRINGS KIDS ON-LINE SKILLS CENTRAL TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY JOBS TO GO AT ORACLE IRELAND ROAMING AND DSL DOMINATE COMREG EVENT MICROSOFT SHIFTS JOBS TO DUBLIN FLEXTRONICS TO SHUT TULLAMORE PLANT ADAPTEC CLOSES EUROLOGIC SITE, CUTS JOBS SINGLE TIP SMASHES CHILD PORN RING NTL TO RAISE USD1 BILLION TO PAY DEBT Place content in here end extra navigation OBJECTIONS RAISED OVER NEW TELCO PRODUCT Eircom is due to make partial private circuits available from \r\r\n3 October, but an industry group has already expressed \r\r\ndissatisfaction with the process. Since partial private circuits\r\r\n(PPC) -- a kind of leased line that uses part of Eircom's network \r\r\n-- are designed to open up the leased line market to Eircom's \r\r\nrivals, it is thought that PPCs will be sold for about 50 percent \r\r\nof the price that leased lines go for. However, the pricing scheme \r\r\nthat has been proposed by Eircom has been deemed confusing by ALTO, \r\r\nan organisation that lobbies for entrant telecoms in Ireland. ALTO \r\r\nhas said that its members have not been able to determine exactly \r\r\nhow the existing PPCs pricing scheme works, or whether the new \r\r\nproducts are any cheaper than a new leased line. FULL STORY BROADBAND BRINGS KIDS ON-LINE The introduction of broadband has resulted in more children going\r\r\non-line in the UK than in any other European country, according to \r\r\nnew research. Adramatic 58 percent surge in the number of \r\r\nunder-18s on-line in the UK is being driven by rising broadband\r\r\nusage, according to a report from audience measurement and research \r\r\nservice Nielsen//NetRatings. Nielsen also said that the number of \r\r\nchildren on-line in eight European countries has grown by 3 million \r\r\nin the last 12 months. The research, which combined data from the \r\r\nUK, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain and the \r\r\nNetherlands, says that there are now 13.1 million European kids\r\r\non-line. This breaks down to about 4 million under-12s and 9 \r\r\nmillion 12- to 17-year-olds. FULL STORY SKILLS CENTRAL TO ECONOMIC RECOVERY Forfas has warned that an inadequate supply of skills across the\r\r\nIrish workforce will hamper Ireland's future economic prosperity.\r\r\nThe fourth report of the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs \r\r\n(EGFSN) identifies the issues that need to be addressed in order \r\r\nto ensure that Ireland benefits fully from an assumed world \r\r\neconomic upturn. It reviews seven key sectors of the Irish economy,\r\r\nincluding ICT, biotechnology and financial services. Sectors as \r\r\ndiverse as biotech, engineering and logistics are primed for \r\r\nsignificant growth from 2005 onwards, Forfas said, warning that if \r\r\ncurrent trends in the supply of skills by the education and \r\r\ntraining sector are left unchecked, there will be a significant \r\r\nshortfall in the skills needed to fuel this growth. FULL STORY JOBS TO GO AT ORACLE IRELAND Business software company Oracle is expected to shed over 100 jobs\r\r\nat its Irish facility over the next 10 months.  According to \r\r\nreports, the jobs will be lost in the firm's shared services centre \r\r\nin Dublin, and the big software maker said it expects that most of \r\r\nthe positions will go through natural attrition. However, if an \r\r\ninsufficient number of workers have left by mid-2004, redundancies \r\r\ncould be implemented. Once the restructuring is complete, the firm \r\r\nshould have about 950 employees in Dublin, or about 25 fewer than \r\r\nit had in January 2002, when it promised to hire another 200 Irish \r\r\nworkers. In fact, the IDA has said that Oracle has only ever \r\r\ncommitted to employ 950 people in Ireland, with just 200 staff \r\r\nallocated for the shared services centre. FULL STORY ROAMING AND DSL DOMINATE COMREG EVENT Two controversial telecoms-related issues were tackled at a recent\r\r\nComReg conference: poor broadband uptake and the high cost of \r\r\nmobile phone roaming. At the telecoms regulator's \"Getting \r\r\nConnected\" event in Dublin, John Dunne, CEO of the Chambers of \r\r\nCommerce of Ireland, launched an attack against the government and \r\r\nthe country's main fixed-line telecoms over the poor uptake of \r\r\nbroadband by SMEs. He said that small firms don't trust the \r\r\ntelecoms firms that are offering ADSL and added that the government\r\r\nhad done little to stimulate demand for the service. At the same \r\r\nevent, Communications Minister Dermot Ahern predicted the end of \r\r\nroaming charges in the island of Ireland early next year, branding \r\r\nsuch costs as a \"rip off.\" Ahern also said he would raise the \r\r\nissue with his Northern counterpart, Minister Ian Pearson. FULL STORY MICROSOFT SHIFTS JOBS TO DUBLIN Close to 50 Microsoft jobs from around Europe are set to be shifted \r\r\nto Ireland as the company further integrates the Navision business \r\r\nit picked up last year. The company said that over the next several\r\r\nmonths, 46 existing positions within Microsoft Corporation will be\r\r\nshifted to the company's EMEA operations centre, Microsoft Ireland\r\r\nOperations Limited. The re-organisation, part of a global \r\r\nre-alignment following Microsoft's purchase of Denmark-based \r\r\nNavision, will take place over the next few months. It's understood \r\r\nthat Microsoft will offer workers in existing EMEA sites the posts \r\r\nin Ireland before seeking to fill the positions with new workers. \r\r\nOf the 24 existing Navision operational sites in Europe, 17 are \r\r\naffected by the re-organisation, a spokesperson said. FULL STORY FLEXTRONICS TO SHUT TULLAMORE PLANT Contract electronics maker Flextronics is shutting its Tullamore \r\r\nplant, with the loss of 80 jobs. The job cuts were blamed on the \r\r\nloss of contracts, as well as the relative high cost of \r\r\nmanufacturing in Ireland compared to lower-cost economies in Asia \r\r\nand elsewhere. The announcement came on the same day that storage \r\r\nsystem maker Adaptec announced the closure of its Dublin plant, \r\r\nciting similar reasons (see below). Last month, network equipment\r\r\nmaker 3Com announced the closure of its Blanchardstown plant, \r\r\nwith the loss of over 600 jobs, in favour of overseas \r\r\nmanufacturing. At its peak in Tullamore, Flextronics employed over \r\r\n400 people, but last year around 320 permanent jobs and 50 \r\r\ntemporary jobs were cut at the plant. Since 2001, Flextronics has \r\r\nalso slashed hundreds of jobs in Limerick and Cork. FULL STORY ADAPTEC CLOSES EUROLOGIC SITE, CUTS JOBS After being acquired just six months ago by US storage company\r\r\nAdaptec for USD30 million in cash, Eurologic is set to close its\r\r\nIrish operations as work is shifted overseas. The company said that\r\r\nabout 40 jobs at its facility in the Clonshaugh Industrial Estate \r\r\nin Dublin would go before the end of the year. Any remaining \r\r\nDublin-based staff working at the former Eurologic site will be \r\r\nmade redundant by March 2004, when the Dublin manufacturing \r\r\noperation will be shut down. In total, 75 jobs will be lost in Ireland \r\r\nas a result of the moves. It is understood that former Eurologic \r\r\nworkers in the company's overseas locations, most notably the US, \r\r\nwill be unaffected. Aspokesperson for Adaptec said the firm is \r\r\nmoving Eurologic's network storage operations from Dublin \r\r\nto Singapore. FULL STORY SINGLE TIP SMASHES CHILD PORN RING Thanks to a single tip-off to a hotline a year ago, one of the\r\r\nbiggest child pornography rings has been smashed. Operation Marcey\r\r\nkicked off in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt on 26 September, \r\r\ninvolving 1,500 police officers who, over the course of a day, \r\r\nconfiscated 745 computers, over 35,000 CDs, 8,300 diskettes and \r\r\n5,800 videos, all thought to contain illegal child pornography that\r\r\nhad been traded over the Internet. The operation saw police forces \r\r\nidentify 26,500 suspects in 166 countries around the world. \r\r\nIrishman Cormac Callanan, secretary general of INHOPE, a \r\r\nconfederation of child pornography hotlines, said that a tip-off to \r\r\nGerman police last year from Spanish hotline Protegeles began the \r\r\ninvestigation that ballooned into what may be the largest ever \r\r\nchild porn raid by police. FULL STORY NTL TO RAISE USD1 BILLION TO PAY DEBT UK cable company NTL has said that it will raise over USD1 billion\r\r\nthrough a rights issue in order to cut debt. The company, which \r\r\noperates in the UK and Ireland and only came out of bankruptcy \r\r\nearlier this year, filed papers with the SEC which confirmed that \r\r\nit was seeking the cash. The company said that the USD1.05 billion \r\r\nraised through the scheme would be used to repay a loan it agreed \r\r\nto under the terms of its bankruptcy proceedings. Some of the money \r\r\nwill also be paid to its USD650 million working capital facility, \r\r\nand the remainder will go toward subsidiaries and general corporate \r\r\npurposes. The filings also revealed that former NTL CEO Barclay \r\r\nKnapp was paid USD2.1 million in severance fees after resigning in \r\r\nAugust. Knapp is also understood to be collecting USD6,000 a day in \r\r\nconsulting fees. FULL STORY End Weekly Digest ElectricNews.Net Ltd, 4 Lower Hatch St., Dublin 2, Ireland tel: +353 1 676 9995"
