Of course, the\n   enthusiasm for the triples in the community at large is also an advantage,\n   imho.\n\nThere is no problem with considering triples as S-expressions.  The\nproblem is considering them as S-expressions *and* as a formal\ndescriptive language simultaneously.\n\nSuppose someone suggests the use of Unicode as a formal language, along\nthe following lines.  Let the letter \"l\" stand for \"lives in.\"  Let\n\"W\" stand for George W. Bush.  Let \"D\" stand for Washington, D.C.\nLet \"T\" stand for Tony Blair, and \"L\" for London.  Let \"t\" stand for\n`taller than.'  And so forth.  Make sure every printing character is\nassigned a meaning.  Now take any string and divide it into groups of\nthree characters, and assign to \"pqr\" the meaning \"the relation\ndenoted by p holds between the object denoted by q and the object\ndenoted by r.\"  The whole string then stands for the conjunction of\nthe propositions denoted by the letter triples.  So the string\n\"lWDlTLtTW\" means \"George W. Bush lives in Washington, D.C., Tony\nBlair lives in London, and Tony Blair is taller than George W. Bush.\"\nCall this scheme URF, for \"Unicode Representation Format.\"  \n\nNow suppose Iargue that URF isn't a very powerful language, for\nreasons that Ihardly need to enumerate.  It would be frustrating if\nthe pro-URF faction comes back with the rejoinder, \"What do you mean,\nit isn't very powerful?  You can represent *anything* in Unicode, can't\nyou?  Isn't it useful to have a `common exchange protocol'?\"\n\nThis may sound like a parody, but to me statements such as this one by\nSeth seem to be of exactly this type:\n\n   Inferencing is an application that sits on top of the triples ... let the\n   best one win.  Ifail to see how this is an argument against simply using\n   triples.\n\nIn my URF world, couldn't Isay  \n\n Inferencing is an application that sits on top of the Unicode ... let the\n best one win.  Ifail to see how this is an argument against simply using\n Unicode.\n\nThe point is that no one is arguing against using Unicode or RDF as a\ncoding scheme; the argument is against using either as a formal\nlanguage.  If RDF is simply an encoding scheme, then we can put it on\nthe back burner and focus on the language actually being encoded.  \nIf we view it *as a formal language*, then its flaws loom large.  It\nlacks many key features, including implication and bound variables.\n\nActually, Iam not convinced that it's such a great encoding scheme.\nIam told it goes beyond XML in some important ways, but I'm not sure\nwhat they are.\n\n   >The RDF documentation and discussion archives are rife with\n   > elementary errors (such as confusing use and mention, confusing\n   > syntactic structure with meta-description, confusing asserting with\n   > reference, confusing names with URIs, and confusing dereferencing\n   > with denotation) that they often border on being simply incompetent.\n\n   Hey man! ...then give us a hand ...\n\nAs Ihave argued before, Idon't think it would be particularly\ndifficult to fix the problems with RDF.  However, fixing them would\nrequire thinking of an RDF expression as a self-contained textual\nobject, which seems to be incompatible with thinking of it as a piece\nof a graph, and therefore incompatible with the triples model.  Ithink this is where we're stuck.\n\n                                             -- Drew McDermott"
