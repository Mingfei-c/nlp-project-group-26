Go directly to the collection, Inventing Entertainment: the Early Motion Pictures and Sound Recordings of the Edison Companies , in American Memory, or view a Summary of Resources related to the collection. The film and audio recordings collected in Inventing Entertainment provide opportunities to chronicle the evolution of the motion picture \n          industry and its influence on popular entertainment. Footage of vaudeville \n          performers provides a catalyst to assess the demise of theatrical film \n          during the early-twentieth century. Films of the Western genre can prompt \n          a discussion on how certain styles transcend the media after entering \n          the nation's cultural vocabulary. Additional films can be analyzed to \n          discuss the merits of public executions and to research historic firsts \n          in technology and popular entertainment."

Actors, singers, athletes, \n          comedians, magicians, dancers, and other performers entertained middle-class \n          audiences in theaters across the country. This collection features footage \n          of vaudeville entertainers such as modern-day Hercules, Eugene \n          Sandow , dancers such as the Leander \n          Sisters and Carmencita , Venezuelan rope and slack wire walker Juan \n          Caicedo , and the acrobatic comic duo, Robetta \n          and Doretto . Asearch on the term, vaudeville , results in audio recordings of comic songs such \n          as Gasoline \n          Gus and His Jitney Bus and a variety of vaudeville films."

Film projectors entered vaudeville \n\n              theaters in 1896 and they eventually became the biggest attraction \n\n              on the bill. While the comic film, Uncle \n\n              Josh at the Moving Picture Show exaggerates people's reaction \n\n              to the realism of the silver screen, it also demonstrates how theaters \n\n              featured a variety of short films. Motion pictures such as The \n\n              Enchanted Drawing and The \n\n              Magician employ trick photography as a modern magic show, \n\n              almost impossible to duplicate as a live stage performance.
