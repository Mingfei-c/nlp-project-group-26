His highly recognizable \n              style has won Glass wide critical and commercial acceptance. Glass's \n              music is marked by its repetitions and bright keyboard figures, \n              and he has made important inroads into scoring music for films and \n              unconventional operas.

Glass avoided all vestiges of plot in the \n                    piece and dug deep into his quiver of repetitions to create \n                    an artfully unnerving five hours of brilliance. The instrumental \n                    ensemble never exceeds five members, playing electric keyboards, \n                    saxophones, flutes, and a single violin.

Glass's epic score, virtually \n                    the only sound in this non-narrative movie, accompanied an \n                    exhilarating, wordless meditation of images ranging from expansive, \n                    slow-motion landscapes to whirling-dervish city scenes shot \n                    using time-lapse techniques. Glass's music was a perfect match. \n                    The opening chant is still unlike anything Glass has composed, \n                    a Tibetan...

Philip Glass, one of our \n                    reigning minimalists, studied under Darius Milhaud and Nadia \n                    Boulanger in Paris and his music has always had a quiet Debussy-like \n                    character to it. What is amazing is that Glass is one of the \n                    minimalists who have made a successful transition into opera \n                    (John Adams is the other).

His masterpiece in this repetitious \n                    and rigorously structural composition style-- Music \n                    in Twelve Parts --may be just too much for some people \n                    to take. If so, then this disc may be just the ticket. Of \n                    course, Glass's many fans will snap it up as a matter of course, \n                    but as the title implies, there's somewhat more happening \n                    here than in his very first minimalist works--just enough \n                    so that newcomers to the style...
