      "text": "Being an undergraduate student involves two main expenses: tuition fees and living expenses. We classify all students as UK, EU or international for fees purposes. The amount you will pay \nfor tuition fees and the financial support available to help you with this will depend on your fees classification, \nwhich will be determined in accordance with the Education (Fees and Awards) Regulations 1997. \nYou will find further information about these Regulations at the following web address: www.bristol.ac.uk/academicregistry/fees/class.html . If you are from the UK or the European Union (EU), your tuition fee for any course at Bristol will be 3,000 \nin 2006/07. The vast majority of other universities will be charging the same. The fee will go up by inflation in \neach subsequent year. You will not have to pay the money before or during your time at the University. You will only \nhave to start repaying it after you have graduated and are earning more than 15,000 a year. The rate at which you \nrepay the fee will be linked to your income. Information about tuition fees for international students and for students from the Channel Islands or Isle of \nMan appears at www.bristol.ac.uk/academicregistry/fees . Whether you are a UK, EU or international student, your living expenses will mainly include accommodation \n(unless you are a UK student living rent-free at home), food, entertainment and books. You can get a good idea of \nthe cost of accommodation from the University's Accommodation Office .  Your other living expenses will depend to a large \nextent on your way of life. At present, most students spend something in the region of 6,000 to 8,000 a year on \ntheir living expenses, including accommodation. If you are thinking of applying to study at Bristol, please don't be put off by the cost of studying and \nliving here.  There is help for UK/EU students who need it, both from the Government and the University. (Back to top)"

The other 25% will depend on income and how much maintenance grant you \nreceive. To apply for the student loan for maintenance, contact your Local Education Authority – \nsee www.dfes.gov.uk/studentsupport/ for more guidance. Your student loan for maintenance will be combined with your student loan for tuition fees and you will start repaying both together after you have graduated and are earning more than 15,000 a year.
