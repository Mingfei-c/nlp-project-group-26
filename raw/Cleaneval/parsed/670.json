      "text": "Before 2000 the IUCN Red List was produced in book format. However, since 2000 the Red List has only been available electronically. The reasons for this departure are simple: The decision to incorporate plants and animals into a single Red List, rather than treating them separately, meant that the total species coverage more than doubled in 2000, and continues to increase with each update of the Red List. The 2000 Red List marked the start of a process to document all species listed. This documentation greatly increases the size but also the utility of the Red List. The IUCN Red List now makes better use of the electronic medium as it provides a wider audience with easy access to the information. The Red List is updated at least every two years and increasingly is updated annually, and so the production of a book for each update would be too prohibitive both in terms of time and cost. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is \navailable only as an electronic version on the World Wide Web. A CD-ROM version \nof the Red List was produced in 2000 and funds permitting, a new version will \nbe produced in the future. The information presented is based on data extracted from \nthe SSC Species Information Service (SIS) Red List database maintained by the \nIUCN SSC Red List Programme Office in Cambridge, UK. The information provided \nhere covers all taxa that have been assigned an IUCN Red List Category with the \nexception of those designated as Not Evaluated (NE). All the assessments \npresented, except those for geographically isolated subpopulations or stocks, \nare for the taxon (species, subspecies or variety) as a whole (i.e. they \nindicate the global risk of extinction). No national or regional Red List \nassessments are included, except for national extinctions (where known) and an \noccasional note about national or sub-national status in one of the \ndocumentation fields."

Anyone making submissions for inclusion on the Red List is requested to provide (in addition to the usual details about name, status, criteria and distribution) a justification to support the listing; a map of the extent of occurrence; a list of the major habitats the species is found in; what the major threats are; an indication as to whether the species' population trend is increasing, decreasing, stable or unknown; what conservation actions are in place or are needed; and information on the utilization of the species. Non-mandatory information is also collected on life history attributes, the value of species for human livelihoods and the importance of species to ecosystem processes. If the taxon assessed falls within the jurisdiction of an appointed Red List Authority then it will be referred to them for evaluation  (for further details about Red List Authorities and how to submit assessments see the IUCN/SSC Red List Programme and the Red List Assessment Process ). The documentation on the Detailed Results page for each taxon may include some or all of the following information under the headings indicated:"

      "text": "Although the name IUCN Red List of Threatened Species implies that the primary focus is at the species level, the IUCN Red List also \nincludes assessments that are done at the infra-specific or subpopulation \nlevels. Ideally, for such taxa to be included in the Red List, the global \nstatus of the species itself should be assessed. In most instances this is the \ncase and generally these are assessed as Least Concern (LR/lc or LC). There are \nsome cases, however, especially amongst the plants where this has not been done \nand it may well be that some of these species warrant a threatened status. For \nsubpopulations (also called stocks), only geographically isolated \nsubpopulations, between which there is little genetic exchange (typically one \nmigrant individual or gamete per year), are included on the IUCN Red List. In the 2000 version of the Red List, all searches \nproduced combined results for species, subspecies, varieties and \nsubpopulations. In many cases users only wanted species-level information and \nif the lists were very long this was often difficult to extract. The default \nsearch options now provide results at the species level only. Searches for \nsubspecies, varieties and subpopulations have to be specified separately.  If assessments for subspecies, varieties or subpopulations are available, these are clearly indicated from the detailed results pages of the species concerned."

The list of synonyms also includes misspellings (orthographic errors).  It is not intended that the IUCN Red List will maintain an exhaustive synonymy for all taxa on the list, however, commonly used synonyms are often included.

      "text": "Distribution is recorded in terms of country names following the 5th edition (and subsequent web updates) of the ISO-3166-1 standard (ISO 1997). Unless geographically very remote from \neach other, islands and other territories are included with the parent country. \nIn the case of species that inhabit islands significantly distant from the \nmainland, the island name is given in parentheses (e.g., Spain (Canary \nIslands)). The naming of such islands follows edition 2 of the World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions (Brummitt et \nal . 2001) prepared for the International Working Group on Taxonomic \nDatabases (TDWG). The TDWG geographic system also provides a standard set of \nBasic Recording Units (BRU) that are sub-country units based on provinces or \nstates. The BRU's are used to subdivide very large countries like Australia, \nBrazil, China, South Africa, the Russian Federation and the United States of \nAmerica, etc. into smaller more conveniently sized units for recording \ndistributions. This system has been adopted for the IUCN Red List wherever \npossible. Most plant taxa on the Red List have had their distributions recorded \ndown to BRU level where appropriate, but unfortunately sub-country information \nis still lacking for most of the animal species. Hence this feature is not \ncurrently searchable. Each country or territory has also been assigned to a \nsingle geographic region to enable users to search by larger geographic areas. \n(View the list of Countries by Regions ). Geopolitical events during recent years may have led to some inconsistency or errors in the distribution information provided. Within reasonable limits every effort has been made to determine which of the new nations that were part of the former Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and USSR support species previously attributed to the larger unit. There may be some species in the Red List that have still not been fully resolved. Adherence to the ISO system also creates some problems, as there is often a time lag between a political change and a new ISO code being allocated for the new country. The version of the ISO codes used for example, maintains Hong Kong and Macao as separate units."

So care should be taken when using the distribution information for subsequent analyses.\nLikewise, for a number of very widespread Least Concern taxa, the list of \ncountry occurrences may be incomplete or in some instances not even recorded \n(e.g., Mus musculus ) because such taxa are virtually cosmopolitan. \nPlease note that the results presented in the published analyses of the \nRed List data (Baillie et al . 2004, Hilton-Taylor 2000), do not include questionable distribution \nrecords and vagrant distributions. Note that summary \nstatistics tables do not include any questionable distribution records\nand records of vagrants, so that the results of any searches on the Red List web site should match the figures in the summary tables."
