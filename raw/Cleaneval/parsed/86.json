      "text": "Approximately three people still haven't read Dan Brown's The\nDa Vinci Code : Mark Liberman , David Lupher , and reportedly at least one other\nperson (as yet unidentified).* Regrettably, neither Barbara nor I are able\nto claim that the third non-reader is one of us.  What can I say by\nway of excuse for this?             \nI found the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo when we were about to  \nleave on a trip to Europe.  I bought it for the long, long flights that     \nlay ahead of us, without knowing much about it except that it was supposed     \nto be an intellectual mystery with cryptography and symbology and stuff\nand the blurbs said it was great.  I didn't open it, I just grabbed one\noff a pallet of about 500 copies.\nBarbara was between mysteries at the time, so she grabbed it from me\nand rapidly     \nread it over the next couple of days\nbefore we even left for the airport.  I asked hopefully what it  \nwas like.  She scowled and said something about the Hardy Boys.\nMy heart sank; I understood her to mean it was pathetic but\npossibly of interest to the 11-year-old market.  By the time we were\non our plane she had made sure that\nher flight bag contained a new novel by Menking         \nHannell , and over southern Oregon she told me it was great as\nusual.  Unfortunately I had no better idea of what to do with my time,\nso I opened The Da Vinci Code . I am still trying to come up with a fully convincing account of just\nwhat it was about his very first sentence, indeed the very first word,\nthat told me instantly that I was in for a very bad time stylistically. The Da Vinci Code may well be the only novel ever written\nthat begins with the word renowned .  Here is the paragraph\nwith which the book opens.  The scene (says a dateline under the\nchapter heading, 'Prologue') is the Louvre, late at night: Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted    \narchway of the museum's Grand Gallery.  He lunged for the nearest painting         \nhe could see, a Caravaggio.  Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old\nman heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and   \nSaunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas. I think what enabled the first word to tip me off that I was about to spend\na number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose stylists in the\nhistory of literature was this.  Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalistic\nstories about deaths; you just don't do                   \nit in describing an event in a narrative.  So this might be reasonable\ntext for the opening of a newspaper report the next day: Renowned curator Jacques Saunière died last night in the Louvre\nat the age of 76. But Brown packs such details into the first two words of an action sequence — details of not only his protagonist's profession \nbut also his prestige in the field. It doesn't work here.\nIt has the ring of utter ineptitude.  The details have  \nno relevance, of course, to what is being narrated (Saunière is\nfleeing an attacker and pulls down the painting to trigger the alarm\nsystem and the security gates).  We could have deduced that he would be fairly well known in the museum trade from the fact that he was\ncurating at the Louvre. The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and word\nchoice blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line).      \nLook at the phrase \"the seventy-six-year-old man\".\nIt's a complete let-down: we knew he  \nwas a man — the anaphoric pronoun \"he\" had just been used to refer to him.      \n(This is perhaps where \"curator\" could have been slipped in for the\nfirst time, without \"renowned\", if the passage were rewritten.)\nLook at \"heaved the masterpiece toward himself until        \nit tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap    \nbeneath the canvas.\"  We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of           \ncredentials, for heaven's sake).  Surely \"toward him\" feels better than \"toward himself\"                      \n(though I guess both are grammatical here).  Surely \"tore from the wall\" should\nbe \"tore away from the wall\".  Surely a single man can't fall into a\nheap (there's only him, that's not a heap).  And why repeat the name\n\"Saunière\" here instead of the pronoun \"he\"?  Who else     \nis around?  (Caravaggio hasn't been mentioned; \"a\nCaravaggio\" uses the name as an attributive modifier with conventionally\nelided head noun \"painting\".  That isn't a mention of the man.) Well, actually, there is someone else around, but we only learn that\nthree paragraphs down, after \"a thundering iron gate\" has fallen (by the\nway, it's the fall that makes a thundering noise: there's no such thing\nas a thundering gate).\n\"The curator\" (his profession is now named a second time in case you missed it) \n\"...crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space\nfor someplace to hide\" (the colloquial American \"someplace\" seems very             \nodd here as compared with standard \"somewhere\").  Then: A voice spoke, chillingly close. \"Do not move.\" On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly. Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous           \nsilhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars.                  \nHe was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair.    \nHis irises were pink with dark red pupils. Just count the infelicities here.\nA voice doesn't speak —a person speaks; a voice is what a person speaks with .\n\"Chillingly close\" would be right in your ear, whereas this voice is         \nfifteen feet away behind the thundering gate.  The curator (do we really need to be\ntold his profession a third time?) cannot slowly turn his head if he\nhas frozen; freezing (as a voluntary human action) means temporarily\nceasing all muscular movements.  And crucially, a silhouette\ndoes not stare!  A silhouette is a shadow.  If Saunière can see the man's\npale skin, thinning hair, iris color, and red pupils (all at fifteen feet),\nthe man cannot possibly be in silhouette. Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily,\nthoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad.  In some passages scarcely a   \nword or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with\nalternatives.  I slogged through 454 pages of this syntactic swill, and\nit never gets much better.                \nWhy did I keep reading?  Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International,   \nand airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old Hollywood drivel on a small\nscreen hanging two seats in front of my row did not appeal, that's why.\nAnd why did I keep the book instead of dropping it into a Heathrow\ntrash bin?  Because it seemed to me to be such a fund of lessons\nin how not to write. I don't think I'd want to say these things about a first-time novelist,    \nit would seem a cruel blow to a budding career.  But Dan Brown is all   \nover the best-seller lists now.  In paperback and hardback, and in many\nlanguages, he is a phenomenon.  He is up there with the Stephen Kings\nand the John Grishams and nothing I say can conceivably harm him.  He is\na huge, blockbuster, worldwide success who can go anywhere he wants and\nneed never work again.  And he writes like the kind of freshman student             \nwho makes you want to give up the whole idea of teaching.  Never mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid anagrams and              \npuzzle clues as the book proceeds, this is a terrible, terrible example of the thriller-writer's craft. Which brings us to the question of the blurbs.  \"Dan Brown has to           \nbe one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in the\ncountry,\" said Nelson DeMille, a bestselling author who has himself\nhit the #1 spot in the New York Times list.  Unbelievable\nmendacity.\nAnd there are four other similar pieces of praise on the back cover.\nTogether those blurbs convinced me to put this piece of garbage\non the CostCo cart\nalong with the the 72-pack of toilet\nrolls.  Thriller writers must have a code of honor that requires\nthat they all praise each other's new novels, a kind of omerta that enjoins them to silence about the fact that some fellow member\nof the guild has given evidence of\ntotal stylistic cluelessness.  A fraternal code of silence.  We could\ncall it...  the Da Vinci code; or the Dan Brown code."
