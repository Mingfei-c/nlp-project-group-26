This is not \n                                        direct propaganda, nor is it similar in \n                                        most regards to previous CrimethInc. publications. \n                                        This is a new voice, a new form, a new \n                                        idea, but born of the same fires. These \n                                        are our letters—to the universe. \n                                        To each other. This is where we re-write \n                                        our histories and create our own cultures \n                                        without the mediation of corporations. \n                                        When we are too far away from one another \n                                        for campfire storytelling, we use our \n                                        own voices here, and we use them to call \n                                        out across the distance.
