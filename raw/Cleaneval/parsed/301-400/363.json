Please visit our nameplates page. $10.00 Flat rate shipping on standard size gun and knife cases. Our line of custom Gun/Knife Cases in your choice of genuine Red Oak or Black Walnut. \n        We offer several options to meet your needs of display and protection. Our basic box unit is mitered at the \n        corners and is fitted with solid brass hinges, they average 2 1/4\" deep on the outside.  Alocking latch is\n        also included with this unit.  Wood is 3/4\" thick. The 1/4\" box joint unit has a more traditional style and\n        is fitted with the same brass hinges and locking hasp. Standard mitered box with glass lid option. Box jointed unit with solid lid option Lid units are made of the same genuine hardwoods.  We offer two mitered styles; a framed acylic glass \n        model that allows a viewing access to the interior and a solid top model that affords added strength as well as privacy\n        for your gun or knife.  All framed lids are 3/4\" thick hardwoods using either (a) 1/8\" acrylic glass or (b) 1/4\" Walnut \n        or Oak panels with matching velvet interior.  Solid brass hinges attach lid units to lower boxes. Interiors are custom cut and fitted to your handgun or knife. (We only require an outline on paper of the \n        object the case is for.  This is supplied by the customer and elimates any need for the real item to be sent to us).  Details\n        of the outlining process are described on this page. Close up of green velvet interior Close up of red velvet interior Our case interiors are made of durable Red or Dark Green velvet covering a one inch layer of dense construction \n        foam that has been cut out to contour fit your item not only in outline, but also for depth.  Atypicial interior allows \n        approximately one half of the gun or knife to be in the cut out area.  We use the old style of uncut velvet contour fitting \n        to fill the recess with no seams.  This is very long lasting, and leaves no places for seperation.  This style of interior \n        results in a very pleasing \"wrinkled\" effect which is very common in many antique dueling pistol cases."

      "text": "Please follow the very simple guidelines to ensure a good fit of all objects intended for your Custom Case. The only tools needed are a soft lead pencil, a ruler and typewriter paper.  If your handgun or knife are longer than an\n         8 1/2\" X 11\" standard paper, tape two sheets together and outline on both. Looking straignt down at the object, guide the pencil around the contours or profile as close to the actual size as possible. \n         We cannot stress the importance of the actual size drawing.  We will make the compartments slightly larger than the outline \n         to allow ease in removal of the handgun, knife or accessory. The interior velvet area is approx. 1 inch thick.  Give us the thickness dimensions of the depth of the objects \n         by writing them on their individual outlines (as shown).  Remember, objects that are thicker than 2 1/4 inches will not fit in \n         the basic case.  Larger items will require a deeper case, which will be slightly higher in price. The key is to Take Your Time with the outline process.  Have plenty of good lighting.  Make each ojects' outline as close\n         to ACTUAL SIZE as possible.  Remember to include the depth dimensions on each drawing. Send actual outlines to us in a LETTER .\n         Fax machines can enlarge or reduce important outlines without warning.  Please include your NAME, address and phone number on the back\n         of EACH outline and what objects they represent."
