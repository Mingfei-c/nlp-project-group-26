      "text": "At one point, reviews said,\r\n\t\t\ttelecom giants AT&T, MCI and Sprint were the best choices for long distance\r\n\t\t\tservice but this is no longer true, partly because call quality and service\r\n\t\t\tare uniformly good across all vendors. Meanwhile, the cheaper no-name companies\r\n\t\t\tbuy their long distance service wholesale from the telecom giants, so the\r\n\t\t\tquality of service is generally the same no matter what. Fueling the competitive\r\n\t\t\tmarket are cell phone companies, most of which lure consumers away from traditional\r\n\t\t\tlong-distance services with free evening and weekend minutes. Conventional long-distance\r\n\t\t\tproviders are staying competitive with cell rates, offering single-rate 24/7\r\n\t\t\tplans, so calls to out-of-state relatives no longer need to be delayed in\r\n\t\t\torder to snag lower nighttime or weekend rates. In our research, we found\r\n\t\t\tlong-distance rates as low as 2.5 per minute. And surprisingly, we discovered\r\n\t\t\tthe big three are offering competitive rates in bundled packages. Abundled\r\n\t\t\tpackage is a flat rate fee for unlimited local, in-state and long-distance\r\n\t\t\tcalls. This type of plan, however, is only beneficial if you make a high number\r\n\t\t\tof calls."

Of course, you'll need to do a little math and figure in your\r\n\t\t\tlocal service in order to decide whether you'd do better with an all-inclusive\r\n\t\t\tlong-distance plan like AT&T's Unlimited Plus (*est. $29.95 per month).\r\n\t\t\tBut if you don't make that many long distance calls, a per-minute plan will\r\n\t\t\tmost likely be your cheapest option. Three companies came up repeatedly in\r\n\t\t\tour research: ECG, Pioneer and CogniState. Newcomer\r\n\t\t\t3U Telecom has the best international long-distance rates."

      "text": "SaveOnPhone.com and Tollchaser.com\r\n\t\t\tsay that right now, ECG (Enhanced Communications Group) has the best deal.\r\n\t\t\tLong-distance rates with ECG Easy 2.5 run 2.5 per minute state-to-state with\r\n\t\t\ta minimum 59 monthly charge. The minimum per-call charge is six seconds and\r\n\t\t\tafter that, calls are charged in 18-second increments. While this isn't the\r\n\t\t\tabsolute lowest billing increment we found (some companies bill in six-second\r\n\t\t\tincrements; 3U bills in one-second intervals), competing companies such as\r\n\t\t\tOPEX and PNG charge by the minute. Customer service appears to be a factor\r\n\t\t\tin many of the reviews we read, and ECG excels in this respect as well. Editors\r\n\t\t\tat SaveOnPhone say customer-service response time\r\n\t\t\twas less than one minute. With ECG's Easy\r\n\t\t\t2.5 plan, you must pay your pay automatically with a credit or debit card.\r\n\t\t\tApaper bill or check payment isn't an option. ECG has another plan, the Basic\r\n\t\t\t3.5 plan, which charges 3.5 per minute with a $2.50 monthly minimum. The\r\n\t\t\tonly advantage to this plan is that you get a monthly bill in the mail, which\r\n\t\t\tyou can review before you pay.  Still, if you prefer receiving a monthly paper\r\n\t\t\tbill, ECG has one of the better deals. These plan won't be available to customers in about 15% of\r\n\t\t\tthe U.S.,\r\n\t\t\tdepending on your local service carrier. You can determine whether you are\r\n\t\t\teligible for ECG by punching in your phone number on their Web site (https://dialecg.com).\r\n\t\t\tNote that calls to Hawaii and Alaska cost more (18.7 per minute for Alaska\r\n\t\t\tand 21.4 for Hawaii). Higher-cost calls to these states are typical of discount\r\n\t\t\tlong-distance services. CogniState and CogniWorld are\r\n\t\t\tboth listed in the top five in many of the reviews we read. CogniState, which boasts great in-state rates, also has a\r\n\t\t\tlong distance plan which includes a competitive 3.45 per minute rate with\r\n\t\t\tno monthly minimum and no monthly service charge, along with six-second billing\r\n\t\t\tincrements. Online billing is free, but if you prefer a paper bill, CogniState tacks on a $2 monthly fee if your bill is under\r\n\t\t\t$20. If your bill is over $20, the paper-bill charge is waived. In our research,\r\n\t\t\twe found this policy to be fairly typical of discount long-distance companies. William Van Hefner, editor\r\n\t\t\tof The Digest, reviews the CogniState 3.45 per\r\n\t\t\tminute plan and highly recommends it. He also points out the low rates only\r\n\t\t\tapply to those whose phone service is provided by a regional Bell company\r\n\t\t\tsuch as SBC, BellSouth, and most of Verizon. Customers outside of these service\r\n\t\t\tareas will pay a higher rate. But if your area is served by these companies,\r\n\t\t\tthen you also qualify for the cheaper ECG plan. Known for their International\r\n\t\t\trates, CogniWorld charges 3.9 per minute in the\r\n\t\t\t48 continental United States, and offers low international rates such as 4.3 per\r\n\t\t\tminute to Moscow and 5.5 to Italy. Like CogniState, CogniWorld charges\r\n\t\t\tby six-second increments and has a minimum six-second call time. There are\r\n\t\t\tno monthly fees, but there is the same $2 fee if your bill is under $20 and\r\n\t\t\tyou want your bill by mail. Rates for calls to Hawaii (9 per minute), and\r\n\t\t\tto Alaska (12 per minute), are better than most, but not as great as 3U's\r\n\t\t\t4.8 per minute cost to either state. 3U is a new company mentioned\r\n\t\t\tin two reviews we found, and it undercuts other providers when it comes to\r\n\t\t\tinternational calls and calls to Alaska and Hawaii, even though its 4.8 per\r\n\t\t\tminute domestic rate is higher than ECG and CogniState/CogniWorld.\r\n\t\t\t3U charges in one-second billing increments, an industry first. That means\r\n\t\t\tthat if your call lasts three seconds, you pay for three seconds. With other\r\n\t\t\tplans, you'd pay for a six-second call or even a 60-second call. There is\r\n\t\t\tno monthly fee, and no minimum usage charge. Billing is online or by e-mail,\r\n\t\t\tand you must pay with an automatic credit or debit card deduction. You'll\r\n\t\t\thave about three days to review your bill before your card is charged. You\r\n\t\t\tmay choose to receive a paper bill, but 3U charges $1 for paper. One of 3U's most unique\r\n\t\t\tfeatures is its cheap international calling rates. Many countries (including\r\n\t\t\tAustralia, Japan, Germany and the U.K.) cost the same 4.8 per minute as domestic\r\n\t\t\tcalls (when calling a landline). 3U also gives you a special access number\r\n\t\t\tso you can get those same rates when calling from your cell phone (as long\r\n\t\t\tas your cell phone is registered in the 48 continental states). Your cell\r\n\t\t\tcompany will simply think you are making a domestic call. If you're calling\r\n\t\t\tan international cell phone, rates vary a lot, but are still lower than other\r\n\t\t\tcompanies. Complete rate info is easy to find on the 3U Web site (http://www.3Utelecom.com).\r\n\t\t\t3U is available to anyone; your local carrier does not have to be a Baby Bell\r\n\t\t\t(as it does with ECG), so 3U is a good choice for those who can't get ECG. Total Call International\r\n\t\t\tis not mentioned very often among the least expensive calling-plans, but this\r\n\t\t\tcompany has the advantage a wider availability than ECG or CogniState.\r\n\t\t\tTotal Call has a 3.9 per minute, 24/7 rate plan with no minimums or monthly\r\n\t\t\tfees, and six-second billing increments. You get a regular paper bill in the\r\n\t\t\tmail. Total Call's customer service is unique in that you can request a Spanish-speaking\r\n\t\t\trepresentative, in addition to five other languages. Although it is more expensive\r\n\t\t\tthan ECG, Total Call is available with most carriers, and is a good choice\r\n\t\t\tif you don't live in ECG's coverage area and don't\r\n\t\t\tmake many international calls (3U is cheaper for international calls). Pioneer is another company\r\n\t\t\twe saw mentioned frequently in reviews of long-distance services. Pioneer's\r\n\t\t\tper-minute rate is cheaper than anyone else: 2.7 per minute for domestic\r\n\t\t\tcalls (excluding Hawaii and Alaska). This company also has a good reputation\r\n\t\t\tfor customer service. Billing, however, is in 60-second increments, so if\r\n\t\t\tyou make a 10-second call, you are billed for 60 seconds. Like ECG, your current\r\n\t\t\tlocation must be served by a baby Bell company, so about 15% of the country\r\n\t\t\twon't be able to access Pioneer. Paper bills cost $1. There appears to be\r\n\t\t\tlittle difference between ECG and Pioneer, but we like ECG's shorter\r\n\t\t\tbilling increments. If you make a lot of intrastate calls, it pays to check\r\n\t\t\tthe rates of both carriers. We also saw several plans\r\n\t\t\tthat offer some kind of incentive for luring your friends and relatives to\r\n\t\t\tjoin up. AmeriCom offers an incentive of 3.5 per\r\n\t\t\tminute for referring three friends plus a bonus of 1% of your friends' usage,\r\n\t\t\tbut if you are always nagging your friends to switch phone providers, you\r\n\t\t\tmight find yourself with fewer friends to call. Several providers offer incentive\r\n\t\t\tminutes. PNG (Power Net Global) entices new customers with 100 free minutes.\r\n\t\t\tThe catch is that these minutes are distributed after four months, and you\r\n\t\t\tcan only use 25 free minutes per month. If you fail to use up your free minutes,\r\n\t\t\tyou lose them. Big Red Wire is also available\r\n\t\t\tin all but fifteen states (excluded states are AK, AZ, CO, IA, ID, ND, MN,\r\n\t\t\tOR, MT, NE, NM, SD, UT, WA and WY). There's no monthly charge, and rates are\r\n\t\t\t2.6 per minute. Big Red Wire offers only e-mail customer service and automatic\r\n\t\t\tcredit/debit card billing. If you know anyone else using BRW, this company\r\n\t\t\twill give you $5 worth of free calls per month, but only to other users of\r\n\t\t\tBig Red Wire."

      "text": "Check the fine print for a monthly fee or minimum usage charge. For most\r\n\t\t\t\tcallers, a monthly fee is a completely unnecessary expense. Since long distance\r\n\t\t\t\trates decrease as competition grows, some companies add a monthly fee to offset\r\n\t\t\t\tthese lower charges. Most companies call this charge a 'recovery fee.' The\r\n\t\t\t\tonly federally mandated charge is federal tax. The USF (Universal Service\r\n\t\t\t\tFund) charge is required of long-distance companies, but the company is under\r\n\t\t\t\tno obligation to pass the fee to consumers (most do anyway). Anything additional\r\n\t\t\t\tcharges on your bill (other than calls) are assessed by the long-distance\r\n\t\t\t\tcompany, no matter what phrasing they use. Time increments can have a big impact on your bill. Some companies (like\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAT&T) bill\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tin one-minute increments; if your call lasts one minute and one\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsecond, you're charged for two minutes. This unused time can add up, especially\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tif you make many short long distance calls. Programs that bill\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tat six-second increments more accurately reflect your actual calling time.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tEditors of Phonedog.com say the savings are 12% to 14% when using a six-second\r\n\t\t\t\t\tbilling increment versus a full minute plan. Inbound toll-free service is a nice option. This can be a great way to\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tavoid accepting charges for collect calls. Many long distance\r\n\t\t\t\t\tproviders now offer residential 1-800 numbers, usually with the same rates\r\n\t\t\t\t\tas outbound long distance calling. There's usually a monthly charge of about\r\n\t\t\t$3 for this service and many services, such as ECG and 3U, offer it for free."

      "text": "The USF (Universal Service\r\n\t\t\tFund) is a required fee from the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) used\r\n\t\t\tto help supplement phone service for low-income families, schools, roads,\r\n\t\t\tlibraries and health care. Phone-service providers are under no obligation\r\n\t\t\tto pass the fee to consumers, but most do anyway. In the past, companies used\r\n\t\t\tthis as a license to charge pretty much whatever fees they liked, attributing\r\n\t\t\tthem to USF and pocketing the difference. That has changed. The FCC now mandates\r\n\t\t\tthat all companies charge the same fixed amount, which is announced and changed\r\n\t\t\tquarterly, and pay the full amount to the FCC. The current USF fee can be\r\n\t\t\tfound on the FCC Web site (www.fcc.gov). Bear in mind that this report\r\n\t\t\thas no relevance to intrastate calls. If a considerable amount of the charges\r\n\t\t\ton your monthly bill comes from long distance calls made within your state\r\n\t\t\t(i.e., from Los Angeles to San Francisco), you'll have to do some of your\r\n\t\t\town research to find the best rates, since intrastate rates vary so greatly\r\n\t\t\tfrom state to state and between carriers it's impossible to make recommendations\r\n\t\t\tfor the general consumer.

AT&Tcharges a monthly connection fee in 23 states to recoup charges from some\r\n\t\t\tlocal phone companies. The fee varies, but is generally between $1.25 and\r\n\t\t\t$1.75. You can find out if your state is included by consulting the AT&T\r\n\t\t\tWeb site. AT&T's Unlimited Plus plan does not include local service, and\r\n\t\t\tyou need to have AT&Tlocal service to qualify for the plan. AT&T's\r\n\t\t\tall-inclusive local and long distance plans start at $58. SaveOnPhone.com recommends\r\n\t\t\tan MCI plan - The Neighborhood bundle plan - for users who spend over $60\r\n\t\t\ton local and long distance service.
