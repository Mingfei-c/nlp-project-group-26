It is essentially C-Kermit with Windows-specific code layered on top\n(notably the terminal emulator and the GUI features) and underneath (Windows\nfile, device, and networking interfaces).  Due to diminished revenues after\nthe economic decline of 2000-2001, Jeffrey Altman, the author of the\nWindows-specific code (as well as of the security code – SSH, SSL/TLS,\nKerberos, and SRP – and much else) was laid off and now has his own\ncompany, Secure Endpoints,\nInc .  All our Windows development expertise is now at that company.\nJeff continues to work on Kermit 95, and has produced numerous fixes and\nenhancements, listed here:"

      "text": "Similarly, those who need new features added or custom modifications made\nto Kermit 95 should contact Jeff directly. Kermit 95 support (questions, troubleshooting, etc) is provided by\nthe Kermit Project as outlined in the below, except that when a problem\ninvolves certain facets of the program (such as terminal emulation or\nsecurity) it might be necessary to refer the case to Secure Endpoints. We do expect to have a new Kermit 95 release incorporating all of Jeff's changes – as well as new\ndevelopments in C-Kermit itself – available at some point.  The exact\ntiming and terms are yet to be determined.  Changes to C-Kermit since K95\n2.1.3 (which was based on C-Kermit 8.0.206) was released are listed in the\nfollowing pages: http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckc208.html (C-Kermit 8.0.208) http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckc209.html (C-Kermit 8.0.209) http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckc211.html (C-Kermit 8.0.211) http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ckdaily.html (C-Kermit 8.0.212, in progress) ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/test/text/ckc212.txt (detailed log of all changes in C-Kermit since K95 2.1.3) The new K95 release , if it comes, will be only for Windows XP and\nlater, will be fully checked out on Windows Vista, and will appear only in\nGUI (not Console) form.  It will come with a modern MSI installer (allowing\nautomated installation and upgrades via Group Policy and\norganization-specific customizations, e.g. packaging of custom Dialer\nentries, initialization files, and scripts).  And since we won't be\nsupporting Windows 95/98/ME any more, we should be able to put the Dialer\nback to using the convenient notebook tabs for its entries rather than the\ncurrent awkward \"direct access\" one-at-a-time method.  We also expect that\nthe next release of Kermit 95 will support large files (transfer, access,\nand management of files bigger than 2GB) and 64-bit integer arithmetic, and\nperhaps also a GUI dialog for file uploads.\nMore about the next release HERE . C-KERMIT SUPPORT AND UPDATE STATUS C-Kermit is still supported and developed within the Kermit Project at\nColumbia University, except for the security code (SSL/TLS, Kerberos,\nand SRP), which depends on Secure Endpoints, Inc (see previous section ).  The C-Kermit page is HERE . MS-DOS KERMIT SUPPORT AND UPDATE STATUS MS-DOS Kermit is still supported by the Kermit Project at Columbia\nUniversity on a best-effort basis, but is no longer in active development.\nSee the MS-DOS Kermit web page for further\ninformation. OTHER KERMIT PROGRAMS Other Kermit programs (IBM mainframe, PDP-11, DECSYSTEM-10/20, PRIME,\nHoneywell, CP/M, and so on) are supported on a best-effort basis, but are no\nlonger in active development (except sometimes ). HOW TO GET TECHNICAL SUPPORT The Kermit project offers technical support in the following ways. Manuals .  The published manuals\nand other documentation should answer the majority of your questions.  Please\nconsult them before asking for technical support: Kermit 95 users: Please consult the online Kermit 95\nmanual , which you can access from the Help menu of the Dialer or the GUI\nversion of K95 itself.  Also look at the Kermit 95\nTutorial and the Kermit 95 FAQ (Frequently\nAsked Questions) before reporting problems; the most commonly reported\nproblems are discussed there. C-Kermit users: Before reporting\nproblems, please consult Using C-Kermit and the online\nupdates and supplements: C-Kermit Tutorial C-Kermit 7.0 Update C-Kermit 8.0 Update C-Kermit Frequently Asked Questions C-Kermit Hints and Tips (for all operating systems) C-Kermit Hints and Tips (for Unix) C-Kermit Hints and Tips (for VMS) And for system administrators and/or programmers: C-Kermit Installation Instructions (for Unix) C-Kermit Installation Instructions (for VMS) C-Kermit Configuration Options C-Kermit Program Logic Manual G-Kermit users: Please look at the G-Kermit documentation for hints and tips before sending questions or reporting problems. MS-DOS Kermit users: Please consult Using MS-DOS Kermit and the KERMIT.BWR and NETWORKS\\SETUP.DOC files in your KERMIT directory before sending questions or reporting problems.\nIf you are having problems with MS-DOS Kermit on Windows 95/98/ME/NT/2000/XP\nor OS/2, please switch to Kermit 95 , which is native to\nthose platforms and fully supported ( CLICK HERE for details). On the Web .  Point your Web browser at http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ and look through the Kermit FAQ (Frequently\nAsked Questions) and other topic areas. By netnews .  Read and post questions to comp.protocols.kermit.misc .\nMembers of the Kermit team will respond to questions on a best-effort basis.\nOthers may also respond. Please don't post large messages (e.g. debug or packet logs, long scripts) to the newsgroup – use email\nfor that (next item). By email to kermit-support@columbia.edu .  Members of the Kermit team will respond\nwithin several days, usually faster. Telephone support is available by calling +1 (212) 854-5126\n(USA, New York). ORGANIZATIONAL SUPPORT An organization (university, company, government agency) that provides Kermit\nsoftware to its computer users or clients should also provide technical\nsupport to them.  The organization may appoint a technical liaison with the\nKermit Project, and we will be glad to supply support to that person. The organization should not send all of its users to us for technical\nsupport.  This can not possibly work, since (a) we do not understand the\nhardware, software, communications, and networking setup of your organization;\n(b) we do not know what customizations have been made to Kermit at your\norganization, and (c) we do not have the resources to help large masses of\npeople one-on-one. If you are member of an organization that provided you with Kermit software,\nplease obtain support from within your own organization.  If they can't help\nyou, then have your organization's technical liaison contact us.  This allows\nthe necessary information to reach your entire organization at once, rather\nthan one person at a time.  If your organization does not have a liaison with\nus, then they should appoint one. HINTS FOR PREPARING A PROBLEM REPORT"

      "text": "Many people are not aware that there are hundreds of different Kermit programs\non thousands of different hardware and software platforms, operating over all\nkinds of different connections.  Not everybody is using the same Kermit\nsoftware you are, on the same kind of computer, or over the same kind of\nconnection.  Before we can begin to help you, we need the following preliminary\ninformation: Is your question about Kermit software? If it is a question about email or some other application, even if you\nare accessing it through Kermit, then it probably is not a question\nabout Kermit software itself.  The Kermit help desk does not offer help with\nemail programs or other non-Kermit applications, except to the extent that\nwe can advise you choose the appropriate terminal emulation and help you set\nup the key mappings, if necessary.  Otherwise, you will need to ask the\nowners, makers, or vendors of the non-Kermit application, or your\norganization's or ISP's local help desk, for help or instruction. Alot of third-party software packages include a Kermit file-transfer\nprotocol implementation (usually not a very good one).  If your software is\nnot a Kermit software program from the Kermit Project at Columbia\nUniversity, it is not our software and we can't help you with it.  Kermit\nprograms all have \"Kermit\" in their names, like MS-DOS Kermit, Kermit 95,\nC-Kermit, G-Kermit, Kermit-370, etc.  If you are asking about the Kermit\nimplementation in somebody else's software, you'll need to go to the maker\nor vendor of that software for help or instruction. If you have a problem transferring files with Kermit protocol between a\nKermit Project program and a third-party product, we'll support our end of it.\nIf the problem lies with the non-Columbia implementation, we'll do our best to\nprovide a diagnosis or workaround, but we can not be expected to support or\nsanction improper or buggy Kermit protocol implementations in third-party\nproducts. If there is a problem with the interface between some other vendor's software\nand one of our Kermit programs, have the vendor of that software get in touch\nwith us. Which Kermit program are you using? (What is its name?  How does it\nidentify itself when you start it?)  The most commonly used Kermit programs Kermit 95 , C-Kermit , are MS-DOS Kermit , and IBM Mainframe\nKermit .  (If your question concerns Kermit-32 on VMS, please note that\nKermit-32 has not been supported since 1987; the supported Kermit software for\nVMS is C-Kermit )."

(Most Kermit\nprograms have a \"version\" command; if not, the version number is\nannounced when Kermit starts).  If you are using an old version\n(see list of current versions ), we will\ngenerally recommend that you install the current version and see if the\nproblem still occurs.  Alist of current Kermit software versions can be found HERE .  If you are using the current version of C-Kermit , we might recommend that you download the latest Development Build to see if the problem is\nalready fixed (you might want to save time by doing this in advance). If it is Kermit 95 2.0 or later, are you using the GUI version or\nConsole version? This information is especially important if your report\nconcerns screen appearance, character sets, fonts, etc.  At this point,\neverybody should be using the version 2.1.3 of K95 in its GUI form .  There is no reason to use the Console\nversion (which suffers from countless bugs and restrictions in Windows\nconsole application support) unless you really know what you are doing. Do you have the manual for your version\nof Kermit?  Have you consulted it? If it is C-Kermit or G-Kermit , did you build it from source code,\nor are you using one of the prebuilt binaries?  If you are using a prebuilt\nbinary, which one?  Are you sure it is the appropriate one for your computer?\n(To overcome such problems as library version mismatches, you might want to\ndownload and build from source.)

      "text": "If your complaint is that you see garbage when the connection is\nmade... please describe the garbage: is it 100% garbage?\nOr is some of the text recognizable? If approximately 50% of the characters\nare wrong, you probably need to tell Kermit to \"set parity even\" (or other\nparity choice) If all of the characters are wrong, there is almost certainly a speed\nmismatch between (a) Kermit and your modem, or (b) the answering\nmodem's serial port and the serial port of the computer or device it is\nconnected to. How did you make the connection? – Did you use Kermit's built-in\nDIAL command?  If not, please try it (\"help dial\" for more information).  The\nDIAL command automatically does what it can to synchronize serial-port speed,\nflow control, and other critical parameters between your computer and the\ndialing modem. If it is a direct serial connection : Are you sure you have the appropriate kind of cable (e.g. null-modem\ninstead of modem)? CLICK HERE for more information\nabout cables. Have you correctly identified the communication port to Kermit\n(e.g. COM1 or COM2 or a TAPI device name in K95; /dev/ttyS0 or somesuch\nin Linux/Unix, etc)?  (SET PORT or SET LINE). Is the speed (\"baud\") the same on both ends?  For example, if the speed\nis 9600 bps (\"baud\") on the far end, then Kermit's speed must also be\nset to 9600 (SET SPEED).  Atypical symptom of a speed mismatch is that you\nsee characters on your screen but they are total nonsense. If the computer on the far end uses \"parity\", you have to set Kermit's\nparity to match: SET PARITY EVEN, ODD, or MARK.  Atypical symptom of a\nparity mismatch is that some characters are intelligible, some are not. If the terminal screen is completely frozen, you might have a\nflow-control deadlock, often caused by an incorrectly or incompletely wired cable or by\ntransmission noise.  Tell Kermit to SET FLOW NONE, and if that unsticks the\nscreen, then you can come back later and fix the real problem.

If you want to send Kermit scripts for us to look at as attachments or enclosures,\nplease give them a name that ends with .txt , not (say) .ini or .scr or .ksc .  Virus scanners will remove\nthem.  Anyway, since Kermit scripts and logs are plain text, you can just\ninclude them directly in your message, there is no need to structure them as\nattachments. Data communication is rarely as simple as we'd like it to be.  From the\nvery basic set of questions above, you can see that there are at least\nthree, and perhaps as many as eight (or more) completely separate hardware\nand software components to your connection, all of which must be configured\nto interoperate with each other and to pass the desired data through. This is why communications software can be harder to use than self-contained\napplications that stay inside your computer, where (hopefully) all\nquantities are known.  Also note that when you are using Kermit to make a\nserial connection, you are performing the job of a network specialist\n– making a connection that did not exist before, probably using a\nvariety of equipment and software from different makers.  Network\nspecialists need years of training before they can do this – don't\nexpect it to be effortless, although sometimes it might be.  Every case is\ndifferent.  (Network connections are usually easier, because network\nspecialists have already set up the network for you.) Kermit manuals are generally 400-700 pages long.  Agreat many of these pages\nare devoted to the many and varied communication methods, and what that can go\nwrong on each one, and methods for diagnosis and repair of problems.  Please\nuse the manuals.  If you have suggestions for making them better, send them to us . Thank you for helping us to serve you better!"
