      "text": "CAW LOCAL 3000 MEMBERS AT STARBUCKS UNION GIVES STRIKE NOTICE AFTER COMPANY \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tREFUSES \"WRITTEN RECOMMENDATIONS\" ASKS \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMEDIATOR TO BOOK OUT April 25, 1997 At the Labour Relations Board last Monday \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Union, after a number of hours of \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdiscussion, offered Starbucks \"a way out\" \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof both the Distribution Centre crisis \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthat they created and the impasse in collective \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbargaining. We proposed the following: - three days of negotiations with the \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tassistance of both the present mediator, \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDebbie Apps and the Associate Chair of \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMediation, Brian Foley. The Company also \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thad to come to the table with a WAGE \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOFFER . Following these negotiations \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe proposed that the mediators make written \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\trecommendations . Under the process \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof written recommendations both sides \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tare obligated to take a vote on the principals: i.e. Starbucks Howard Shultz or his designate CAW Local 3000 Starbucks employees represented \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby the Union Starbucks refused and so the Union now \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas asked the Mediator to \"book out\" and \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twe have served seventy-two hours strike \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnotice. As we are under Section 55 proceedings \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Associate Chair of Mediation determines \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen the Parties are in a legal position \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto exercise their mandate. In his letter \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto the Parties, Mr. Foley states that \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe strike/lockout option will be legal \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\"just after May 14th\". This is not uncommon \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif written recommendations are rejected \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tby one side as an option. Earlier today \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIconcluded a first collective agreement \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta couple of hours before the notice had \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlegal effect. This was at Link Technologies \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin Delta. Oh, by the way, that Company \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twas threatening to close its doors too \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbut the membership held firm - 125 workers \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twere involved. At last Wednesday's meeting it was nice \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto see our members support the combination \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the unstrike at the retail outlets \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand picketing at the Distribution Centre. \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis was originally planned for May 1st \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif we were in a legal position but this \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas been nixed at least until May 15th. HARGROVE TO MEET YOUR NEGOTIATIONS COMMITTEE \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAND LOCAL UNIONS' LEADERSHIP. Our National Union President, Buzz Hargrove \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twill meet with our Union Negotiating Committee \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand the Lower Mainland CAW Local Union \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tleadership this Wednesday at our Union \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHall in New Westminster. After his assistant, Peggy Nash, and \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe undersigned gave a report to our recent \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCAW National Leadership Conference in \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOntario and Buzz said \"if Starbucks does \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot return to the table and deal with \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe key issues including wages we may \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave to organize a boycott\" (of course \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twhen we are in a legal position to do \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tso). Aworldwide boycott of Starbucks would \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tonly be as a last resort. However, Starbucks \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thas to realize with closure of the Distribution \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCentre and its failure to bargain in good \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfaith with our Union the result is a boycott. \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWe will not only rely on the strength \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof our membership at Starbucks but on \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe entire support of the labour movement \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\taround the world. UNION NEGOTIATING COMMITTEE TO ALSO MEET \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCLC HEAD - BOB WHITE On Saturday afternoon at our Union Hall \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(May 3rd) Bob White will meet with your \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCommittee. In addition to heading up the \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCanadian Labour Congress, Bob is an officer \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tof the International Confederation of \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTrade Unions. We know we can count on \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBob to get the word out on Starbucks conduct \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin negotiations to date. GENEVA DELEGATES HEAR FIRST HAND CAW Local 3000 President, Denise Kellahan, \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tspoke of the announced closure of the \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDistribution Centre and the other key \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tissues in bargaining to the Food Union's \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tworld wide Congress in Geneva, Switzerland \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta couple of weeks ago. She has made some \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinvaluable future contacts. Seventy-four \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcountries from around the world attended \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Congress. GUATEMALAN LABOUR EDUCATION SUPPORT GROUP \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCONTACTS CAW Stephen Coats informs us that Starbucks \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\twants a meeting soon with his Chicago \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbased group after his group threatened \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta boycott of Starbucks for its failure \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tto enforce its Code of Practice for coffee \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgrowers in Guatemala. Stephen seemed to be really upset with \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe announced closure of the Distribution \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCentre just after our successful strike \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvote. He has asked us for more details \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tabout our dispute. LRB HEARING MAY 7TH - 9TH The adjudication side of the Labour Relations \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoard will begin to hear sworn evidence \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ton the Union's complaint concerning of \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe Company's illegal lockout and bargaining \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin bad faith surrounding the announced \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclosure of the Distribution Centre and \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthe failure of the Company to produce \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ta wage offer to date as well as its illegal \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tproposal on benefits. These hearing take place at the Labour \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRelations Board which is located at Library \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSquare. They are open to the public but \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave very limited seating unfortunately. 'CITIZENS IN SUPPORT OF STARBUCKS WORKERS' \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBEING FORMED Since the public announcement of the \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tclosure of the Distribution Centre we \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thave had lots of calls. This has resulted \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tin a 'Citizens Group' being formed to \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsupport you. For better future wages and conditions \r\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tand in solidarity, On behalf of CAW Local 3000, Roger Crowther, National Representative CAW Communications"
