      "text": "Chapter 5 (without photos) of HOW TO EUROPE The Complete Travelers Handbook Internet edition. Apage from Enjoy-Europe.com by John Bermont Do not wear the emperor's clothes. Put on something a\nlittle more modest. CLOTHING GUIDELINES What will you wear to Europe? This is a major concern, but it is\nsecondary. The real question is — how much? You are infinitely\nbetter off going with nothing but an umbrella and a toothbrush than\nwith the load you would typically bring on a vacation in the United\nStates. Pack Light As every traveler and chronicler of the subject relates,\npack light. Seldom does anyone define the meaning of pack light,\nexcept to present a list of clothes and accessories to bring, no\nsuch list ever being universally practical. To enjoy travel, you\nmust pack light. To define pack light, travel with your chosen load\nand see for yourself if it is convenient and gives you the freedom\nyou need. Dress Sharp It pays to be well presented, with a European flavor.\nEuropeans are clothes conscious. Northern Europeans look somber,\nwhile brighter colors are more common as you go south. Clothes\nrepresent personality and social status. People wear\ntheir better clothes almost all the time. Europeans seeing you for the first time and only briefly\nwill judge you completely by your appearance, and will behave\naccordingly. Unfortunately for the traveler, most of your personal\ncontact in Europe will be with hotel clerks and cafe waiters. To\nsecure a good room, good table, and good service, dress as if you\ndeserve it. In fact, you will be stopped at the door of many places\nif you are not properly dressed. Be Comfortable In addition, you must keep yourself comfortable. Northern\nEuropean weather is generally cooler, wetter, and more variable\nthan in the United States. South of the Alps and Pyrenees it can be\nwarm and stuffy just about any time of the year. Walking in and out\nof museums, restaurants, and stores may force you to off and on\nyour coat. In stores the heat from those little halogen lamps can\nbe very uncomfortable. Be ready for rain or shine, hot or cold. Pack Light Field Test Ipropose the following test, preferably taken in a light\nrain. Pack everything, put on your hat and coat, open your\numbrella, (raining or not), check the time, and walk one mile away\nfrom home with everything you have. Then, pretending you are trying\nto catch a train or trying to get to the tourist office before it\ncloses, run or walk home. If you can make the round trip\ncomfortably within 45 minutes, you have packed light. It is best if\nyour test course includes a short, steep hill or several flights of\nstairs, upwards on the return leg. Also make sure that all of your traveling companions can\npass the pack light field test. If not, old friends may become\nlifetime enemies. Failure to obey the pack light rule will doom you\nin so many ways that you will be better off to stay home and water\nyour tomatoes. Those taking a cruise or tour may think that they\ncan escape this rule, but be aware that porters and taxis are\nusually scarce and/or expensive. RECOMMENDED CLOTHING Rules for the easy traveler, then, are rather formidable: 1. Pack light 2. Dress sharp 3. Be comfortable Typical Tourist Clothing The clothes worn by most American tourists announce them as\nAmericans better than any trilingual poster ever could. From the\nground up you're wearing: jogger or tennis shoes, worn Levi's,\ncollared tee shirt, and ski jacket, with a backpack. If you are\npast the age of backpacks, your oversized plastic suitcase will\neven more effectively identify you as an American. Go Like a Local For a number of reasons you are better off looking like a\nlocal citizen rather than a standard American tourist. Don't \nmisinterpret this. Ilove the USA and all that it \nrepresents, but Itry to avoid being an American billboard when Itravel overseas. The primary reason is to avoid being a target of \npickpockets, a breed endemic in Europe. You might also think that \nit could avoid being caught up in terrorist bombings as London had \nin July 2005. That is probably not an issue since the murdering \nsons of bitches just kill anybody, including fellow Muslims praying \nat their local mosque. For many years my personal preference was a pair\nof black slip-on shoes, wool/polyester blend slacks, turtleneck\nshirt, and sport coat. This ensemble will get you through almost\nany door in Europe with reasonable respect, keep you comfortable\nunder most weather conditions, and allow you to blend in without\nbeing instantly identified as \"the American.\" The wool/polyester blend slacks look more like wool than\nplastic, but they wash drip dry. You won't need to iron these\nif you care for them according to the label. Levi Strauss has introduced \na new Dockers line available in several colors besides the normal khaki. \nAcouple of pairs of the dark charcoal served me well throughout Europe \non my January 2006 trip. Turtleneck shirts are\nnot common in America. In fact Icouldn't find a single one in December 2005. \nThe men's shops all said that they weren't in style this year. Booosh! You can find them in\nski clothing shops. If you are not in ski country get catalogs from Lands End \nand from L.L Bean for a good selection. Iended up buying \na couple of good cotton T-necks at the V+Ddepartment store after Iarrived in Holland. \nAn open collar dress shirt is a good substitute for the turtleneck in warmer weather. \nIn very few restaurants is a tie required, though you'll see them \noften in better establishments. For off-season travel, Ialso bring a \nlightweight turtleneck sweater. \nMy sport coat has a herringbone pattern and travels very well\nwithout showing wrinkles or minor stains. Levi's Levi's and other brands of denim jeans became fashionable in\nEurope in the 1990's. Levi's are now tolerated in many cafés\nand restaurants during the day. However, regular slacks are much\nmore common as street wear in major cities throughout Europe. Based on my \nobservations of people walking through the central train stations of Europe \nless than 20% were wearing denim jeans. The preference \nfor the vast majority, men and women, young and old, was black slacks. Slacks are also much more in harmony with packing light. Levi's are\nheavy and bulky, and take a day to dry out when they get rained on. If you do \nwear denim, select a lightweight pair with a bit of fashion. You might want \nto consider wearing Levi slacks rather than Levi jeans. Levi Strauss \nmakes a good looking line called \"Action Slacks.\" These are 100% Dacron \nand travel very well. Wash them off in the shower at night and hang them to \ndrip dry by morning. Ihave a couple pairs in black. Irecently switched to another \nLevi Strauss product for my European travels and everyday wear. These are \ncharcoal Dockers, 55% cotton and \n45% MicroPolyester, style number 405189256. They are very comfortable \nand look like dress slacks. When strolling in major cities in the summer a lightweight pair of black slacks \nor skirt plus a white top will serve you well. This \nis standard attire for a large percentage of the native populations, and tourists from \nother European countries. Ihave no ambition of being a clothing cop so accept this chapter as you will. \nThe advice is based on my personal experience in Europe. \nYeah sure, you can wear your back yard jeans or shorts, t-shirt or no shirt, \nsneakers or flip flops, \nand that is the way you will be viewed and treated in the cosmopolitan \ncities throughout Europe. Expect no respect. Dressing well does not have to apply only to Europe. Ihad drifted into wearing \nLevis at my local pub in Michigan a few years ago. One night last summer Iwas \nreturning home from an event where Iwas wearing a jacket and slacks and decided to stop in at \nOscar's, my regular place, to shoot some eight ball. It wasn't long before a young \nlady about half my age started bumping into me and making strong eye contact. After that \nIstarted wearing slacks and a dress shirt when Iwent to Oscar's. Approachments by young dames has happened \nagain and again to the point that it has become \nembarrassing, but Iwon't brag on it. Guys, listen up here! Dress sharp and you \nwon't need all those bull drop lines to meet a girl in Europe, or anywhere. Iwould expect that a woman dressed in Levi's would normally be approached by a man \nin more or less the same low-life outfit. It's only speculation, but Iguess that if you \nwant to meet the prince of your dreams in Europe you would dress to the nines. Why not? Besides, \nwomen in Levi's are about the most asexual creatures on the earth. Idon't know why girls wear Levis. They are so unflattering to the derrière. \nAnd it won't cost you much to dress better. It will probably cost you less than that name brand stuff. Think, \nhave you been to your local second hand store recently. They \nhave some great stuff at laughingly ridiculous low prices. You will want to tell your \nfriends, as Ihave just done. Male speaking, Ijust bought a London Fog brand, zipper in liner,\ntrench coat for $40. It looks better than the the one in my closet that Ibought 15 years ago \nfor $140. Well, Imust admit that it is a bit out of fashion. Most coats in Europe are black and the length is just above the knee, so this thing is the wrong color and a foot too long per current styles. Layers Dress in \"layers.\" This means dressing in items that can be added to or\nremoved individually without changing everything when the weather\nchanges. For example, instead of a heavy overcoat wear a sweater and a windbreaker. \nIf it gets too warm in the afternoon take off the sweater and carry it in a shopping bag.  \nDressing in layers requires that all of your clothes be complementary\nand mixable. Dark, neutral, and earth colors tend to avoid fashion\nclashes, and do not need cleaning as often as lighter colors. Shoes In Europe you'll notice all sorts of footwear — boots,\nclogs, tennis, joggers, sandals, army issue, and Italian fashion.\nMany people will see and examine your shoes before their eyes come\nup to meet yours, if they ever do. Appearance is important.\nWear a good looking, durable, broken-in pair of shoes. Your average\nAmerican department store shoes will probably be mistaken for\nItalian fashion. Perfect. An average pair of polished black \nslip-ons will get you in the door anywhere. Also, rubber soles will\nsurvive far better than leather soles on the rain soaked sidewalks\nof Europe. Instead of shoes, Ihave become a convert to sandals, more\nspecifically Birkenstocks, a German brand. Once you break in a pair\nof Birkenstocks you will never go back to shoes again, except for\nduring stormy weather. You won't even want to go barefoot again. \nBirkenstocks have a half inch of cork between the hard rubber bottom and the \nleather part you rest your feet in. Cork is very easy to walk on. You can \ngo all day in these things. Irecommend black socks with the Birkenstocks, unless you are at the beach. \nBirkenstocks are expensive so you can make this one of your purchases when \nin Germany, at prices 50% less than the American prices. Carry an extra pair of shoes since it is likely that your\nshoes will get soaked occasionally. If you invest in a pair with\nnatural leather uppers, you can oil them to the point that they\nresist water like wax paper. Use mink oil or equivalent once a\nweek. Again, do not wear any kind of sports shoes, e.g. tennis,\njogging, or whatever else they call them these days. Iwas with\nsome business associates in The Hague a few years ago and we\ndecided to take a pub crawl. Two of them had just bought new jogger\nshoes and wore these out for the evening stroll. Several places\nwould not allow them in the door. These places were just your\naverage Dutch cafés and bars, not fancy or up-scale. And\nmy associates were businessmen in their 50s, certainly good potential\ncustomers in any establishment. Those doormen want to keep their jobs so they keep the\noff-spec people outside. Nothing looks clunkier than fresh\nwhite tennies. I've heard that the French call them marshmellows. \nIn my Amsterdam and Brussels train station observations, \njogger shoes were worn by less than 5% of those passing through, usually \nby young people with backpacks. An alternative for those who like tennies is the Florsheim line \nof shoes called \"Comfortech.\" These are light weight black slip-ons with a cushion \nbottom. They look great at a distance and will get you past any maitre d' \nor doorman. Rain Gear Weather protection is essential. Bring a telescoping\numbrella. You can find umbrellas which slide down to under 10 inches. \nAlightweight hooded mackintosh is very\nhandy for those frequent all day rains. Alight pair of leather\ngloves and a hat are helpful for off-season travel, and can even be\nuseful in northern Europe in the summer. WOMEN'S WEAR Friends who have read this book often say that it is overly male oriented. Amajor reason,\nperhaps, is my discussion of clothing, but the attitude probably\nsurfaces in other areas as well. I've seen packing lists \non the internet written by women who must have had a platoon on hand to carry \ntheir utterly essential stuff. Some girls claim that they simply can't\ntravel with only a carry-on bag, and some bring everything\nbut the kitchen sink on a weekend sortie. Here's How Iused to travel like that but learned the hard way how to\ndo it the easy way. For a weekend trip to Paris with my Dutch girl\nfriend many years ago Ipacked two suitcases with six days worth of\nextra clothes and other just-in-case stuff and drove over to pick her up.\nIwas amazed. She wore a black jumpsuit, colorful scarf, a \nfashionable raincoat, and carried a slightly\noversized purse with everything she needed. Although our room was a \nnice one in an above average\nhotel, there was hardly enough space to hang my things or stash the\nsuitcases. My precious Paris time was wasted putting things away,\ndeciding what to wear, and repacking everything. Women writers can give you\nplenty of tips for advice on how to pack light. For encouragement and advice, ladies\nshould consult the books of Mesdames Dena Kaye, Georgia Hesse , Louise Purwin Zobel , \nand Eleanor Adams Baxel . \nSome of these books are decades old but the advice is timeless.\nAnother great source of clothing advice for women is on line at JourneyWoman . \nThis is a collection of first-hand reader-submitted comments for \ncountries around the world, with a generous helping for every \ncountry in Europe. Friendly Helpers Pack light girls. Yes, you can do it. Yes, you must. In fact it is more important for women to pack light than\nfor men. Remember — if you pack it you carry it, you burro\nyou. And if you have too much and some helpful stranger offers to\ngive you a hand in a train station or tourist office, chances are nine out\nof ten that he is helping himself. You might have nothing left to\ncarry when he is done with you. You wonder why a guy would steal a\nwoman's suitcase? He probably has a girl friend who would be\noverjoyed with some American clothes and toiletries. If your\nsuitcase takes a walk, Ihope that you didn't hide your money and\npassport in it; cash, I.D., and clothes — what a score! Iwrote \nthis paragraph decades ago and recently saw the film \"French Kiss\" with \nKevin Kline and Meg Ryan. It is a hoot for Francophiles and graphically \nillustrates my point. Igive Kevin first billing for his great characterization. By the way, when the friendly helper is done with your\nsuitcase, you might look to see if you still have a purse. One of\nhis buddies standing nearby probably picked that off as the first\ncavalier distracted you with his charming accented English. This\nscenario sounds a little harsh, but this is the real world, not the\nfantasy feely-good world created by most travel writers. See\nchapter 8 for advice on avoiding Jesse James and the\nbandit gangs. They're everywhere, and they rarely work alone. BUSINESS WEAR Casual is not cool. No Dockers Americans traveling to Europe on business must wear their\nbest. Impression is critical in doing business overseas. If you\nwear khaki Dockers to work because they are so\ncomfortable, put them aside for your trip. Adark plain lightweight \nwool suit will be accepted for all\noccasions. Use it for after work social events as well. The Tie Is the Thing White shirts are fine and are always OK. You'll see many men \nwearing colors. Iprefer a light blue. Ties from the top fashion names, \nor knock-offs, are the order of the day. Women on Business Ladies, please please please leave your Madeline Albright suits at\nhome. Better yet just throw them in the trash. Those tight pastel\nskirts and jackets are screaming yuk absolutely horrible. What you should do is pack a neutral dark pants\nsuit, a few of your best blouses, and a couple of splashy scarves or a string of pearls. Iam so happy that our present Secretary of State, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, \nlooks right sharp all over the world, and presents an image \nthat all Americans can really be proud of. She is cool, so cool. Imitate her \nand you won't go wrong. Bring only the jewelry \nthat you can afford to have stolen. BEACH WEAR Speedos are the tradional beach wear for men in Europe. Younger fellows have taken up \nwith California surfer style trunks which they wear over the speedos.\n\nWomen normally wear one piece and two piece suits as in the USA. However a large percentage of \nwomen leave the top half of the bikini at home. Topless girls are everywhere. And the \ntonga is popular, showing 99% of the derrière and leaving not much to the imagination. To leave even less to the imagination and not wear anything go to one of the nude beaches. \nGoing naked is allowed on designated coastal beaches and inland waterways throughout Europe. LAUNDRY Unfortunately you do have to wash your clothes while\ntraveling. There are several ways to get it done. In packing light you need only 3 days \nworth of everything plus the clothes on your back. This means a laundry job \ntwice a week. Hotel Service In standard tourist class hotels you rarely see a laundry\nbag, a normal item in American motels. When Ihave found the\nlaundry bag in Europe Ialmost used it for something else after\nreading the prices. It would be cheaper to buy new clothes at\nAmerican prices, but you won't find American prices in Europe. If\nthe hotel does not have a cleaning or laundry service, the desk\nclerk will be able to direct you to a dry cleaner or laundromat. If you are on an extended business trip you probably must\nuse the hotel service because you don't have time to do it\nyourself. Some miserly Dilbert managers will single out this item\non your expense report and try to disallow it. Stand your ground. When having dry cleaning done, make sure that cleaning is\ndone and not just pressing. Write down the native word for\ncleaning. If there are spots or stains, point them out to the\nattendant. Spot removal can't be guaranteed because the spot may be\ndue to loss of dye rather than misdirected spaghetti sauce or wine. Hostel \"Service\" If you are using hostels as you travel, for the economy or the camaraderie, you are likely to find a washing machine in a side room. This will be one of the most convenient and cheapest opportunities for washing your clothes. If you are traveling in high season you may have to wait in line to use the machine. These facilities will be strictly self-service. If you don't understand the workings of the machine, ask. If you put your stuff in and come back six hours later you can expect to see your clothes dumped on any adjacent table or chair. Someone else needed to wash. Do likewise if you need to, but ask the manager first. Just because the machine has stopped does not mean that the wash is finished. It may be on one of its pauses. Before starting ask what the fee is if it is not posted. You may or may not need to furnish your own suds. Laundromats Public laundromats are usually attended, sometimes are coin\noperated, normally have restricted hours, and are typically closed one or two days a\nweek. European machines are smaller than American ones and take one hour\nor more per load. Part way through the wash cycle the machine\npauses for an extended soak. If you allow the laundromat to do\nthe wash for you the attendant will set the temperature depending\non the color of your clothes. Attendants follow the rules on the\nmachine, period. Your permanent press white shirts will probably be\nboiled and returned as permanently wrinkled. Isuggest that you do\nit yourself in a coin machine. If you can't read the directions,\nask around to see if someone speaks English. If that fails, watch\nthe others. Temperatures are in Celsius, a.k.a. centigrade. For\ninformation on Celsius see chapter 27 , \"The Metric System in Europe.\" The price of one load of wash can be three dollars or more.\nDetergent will be available, either in single load sizes from a\ncoin automat or free from a soap tub in the laundromat. Dryers are similar to ours so you should have no\ndifficulty. Dryers normally run on a ten minute cycle and the cost\nis reasonable. Lonely Planet is the only guide book series which locates\nlaundromats in the major cities. Use their maps and legend to find\na place to wash your clothes. You don't necessarily want to ask\nyour hotel. The manager may direct you to one of his associates or\nsub-contractors. That is not always your best deal. Wash Basin or Bidet It's the old fashioned way. If you do not want to go to a\nlaundromat then you must scrub, soak, rinse, wring, and hang to dry. Almost every hotel room in France is posted, \"Don't wash\nyour clothes in the room, and don't eat in the room\" — free\ntranslation from le français (French). My theory is\nthat if no drip marks or crumbs are left on the floor, the spirit\nof the hotel keeper's request is honored. Hand washing clothes in\nyour room will certainly save you money, will probably occupy less of\nyour time, and will relieve you of the uncertainty of delay due to\nsometimes service. Picnicking in your room has exactly the same \nbenefits. See chapter 15, \"Eating Your Way Through Europe.\" Instead of doing your laundry in the wash basin, use the\nbidet. Aletter from a reader of an earlier edition asked if this\nis sanitary. The bidet is clean so why not? You can let your\nlaundry soak for a while and still be able to brush your teeth and\nwash your face. Wring out your\nunderwear and hang it over the usually present radiator. It will be\nwarm and dry by morning. But dust off the radiator first. And do\nthe wash early in the evening since the heat is often turned off at\nnight and then comes back on for a few hours in the morning. One challenge to the scrub-it-yourselfer will be in hanging your clothes \nif they are still \ndripping. This applies to slacks, skirts, shirts, blouses, and other \nouter-wear. If you have no bathtub or shower in the room, use a\nnewspaper to catch the drips. Sometimes a bit of ingenuity will be\nneeded to figure out what to tie your line on. Some rooms are\nalmost impossible. Strapping tape can sometimes come to the rescue. \nSee chapter 6 , \"A Packing List for Europe.\"\nTake your wash down in the morning so that the chambermaid doesn't observe. You don't\nneed a confrontation with the hotel keeper. If your clothes are still damp just hang  \nthem in the closet, if there is one. BUYING EUROPEAN CLOTHES Buying clothes in Europe can be a challenge. Clothing is\ncut differently, partly for style and partly to fit the build of\nthe average citizen. This varies considerably from country to\ncountry. Size Conversion Tables Take care in using the clothing size conversion tables\npresented in travel books. Tables differ. Sales clerks are seldom\nknowledgeable or helpful on this. They know less about American\nsizes than you can learn about European sizes. Size tables are\nposted in some of the large department stores, though in some\nstores Ihave seen conflicting conversion tables for American to\nEuropean sizes on the wall and on garment packages. Ihave bought\nthe same size under shorts with the same brand name in two different\nEuropean countries. One was loose and one was tight. The True Test If you buy clothes in Europe, have yourself measured by a\ncompetent salesperson, if you can find one. Measurements and sizes will normally be in\ncentimeters. See chapter 27 , \"The Metric System in Europe\" if you don't know what this is. \n Men's shirt sleeves are measured\nfrom the shoulders, not the spine. Also try the garment on.\nAscertain whether or not it will shrink when washed. Cotton items\npurchased in Europe will probably shrink. Buy something a size too big, maybe two sizes over. HAIR Although it is not something that most of us pack for a\ntrip, hair is an important part of your wardrobe in the context of\nyour appearance. Men The long grizzly look is characteristic of laborers and\ndopey students, just as it is in the United States. Before you go,\nget a haircut. Short hair is much easier to take care of, an\nimportant consideration while traveling. But, don't get a military\ntrim. That's too short. The morning shave is probably the one thing most men wish\nthey could do without, but it might be better to continue shaving.\nBeards invoke suspicion in many people (e.g., customs agents and\nairport security folks), fear in some (e.g., young women), and instant\ndislike in most of the rest (e.g., hotel clerks and maitres d').\nYou don't need hassles and rejections from these folks while you\nare traveling. But then again, wearing a beard saves time and trouble \nin the morning so make your own call on this. Try to keep it neatly \ntrimmed if you have a beard. Ihave had a beard for many years, on and off.\nIput up with the hassles for the convenience of avoiding the morning scrape. \nSee chapter 6 , \"A Packing List for Europe\" to learn a better way to shave — with vinegar. Women Traditionally, European women do not shave their legs. But they\nseldom show much leg (except at the beach) since their dresses and skirts \noverlap their boots. An American woman traveling in Europe could\neasily escape the regular leg shaving. In addition, many European \nwomen do not shave under their arms. These traditions are crumbling and \nwomen generally shave these days. Whether or not to \ngo traditional is a matter of personal taste.
