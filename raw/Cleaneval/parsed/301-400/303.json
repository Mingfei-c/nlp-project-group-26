      "text": "About Me Last Updated March 2003 Cravings & Fandom Food: Anything\n        that doesn't have seafood in it. The only seafood Idon't mind\n        is Tuna and Shark. Ieat poultry more than beef. The types of food Ido like are\n        Irish (gotta love the champ potatoes!), Mediterranean, Peruvian Food and some Asian\n        foods like Thai. Ethnic Gourmet \n        Foods has some great frozen Thai dishes. Sweets: Sour Skittles, \n        gummy worms and Mocha Blast with Jamocha Almond Fudge (at Baskin \n        Robbins). Dreyer's Dreamer Ice Cream has two awesome flavors Ilike; Tiramisu \n        and Deep Dish Apple Pie. YUM! Now if Iwas trying to be a\n        health nut... Pears, Plums, Strawberries and Watermelon are my favorite fruits. Drinks: Idon't drink soda as much as Iused to but Cherry Pepsi or Cherry Coke is\n        normally the choice if Ido. My main drink is water, ice tea and my\n        addiction to swoon over hot Mochas. Hobbies: IRC, Singing, Rollerblading, Hanging out with friends, seeing the latest movies\n        in the theatres, walking\n        on the beach, Gaming , lighthouses and\n        collecting leopard items. Music: Ilove trance but Ienjoy listening to male singers/bands more often then the female singers.\n        Ilike most styles of music except Irarely fall for classical, opera or\n        jazz. If Ihad to name bands here, it would be ones like Coldplay, Rage \n        Against the Machine, 3 \n        Doors Down, Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, Creed, P.O.D, Linkin Park\n        and Nickelback. Movies : Ienjoy too many! Action movies rock and romantic puppy love movies are on \n        the hit list right now. However, Itotally fell in love with Lord of the \n        Rings series. Favorite Actors: Edward\n        Norton, Jude Law, Heath Ledger and Orlando Bloom. There are other actors\n        Ilike for their character though. Like Nicholas Cage is great at acting and so\n        forth. Although Ihave to admit, Ihave only liked Val Kilmer for\n        his lips. Books: Well\n        my last book was about a dog breed on Pembroke Welsh Corgis. Iwas going\n        to buy a puppy but Iam going to hold off now. College and work is going\n        to ruin any training time for a puppy right now. Although, one of my\n        buddies has been trying to get my into these fantasy dragon books so Imay start reading a lot more again. Ialso need to buy the Lord of the\n        Rings set soon. Sports: Not\n        really into sports like my guy friends. Ioccasionally enjoy watching\n        Football, Hockey games (live ones are fun), and racing (Nascar). Flowers: When\n        Iworked in a floral department (for a few years) Iused to get asked\n        what type of flower was my favorite over and over and over again. I'd\n        always try to change the subject when Icould tell the guy was single.\n        Hehe. Finally I'd have to tell them because some guys are smarter than\n        others. So Imight as well spill the beans here. Iam not a rose person.\n        Ithink they are pretty but when it comes down to it if Ido get one\n        single rose it seems more valuable to me than having a dozen. Two seems\n        more like a connection with you and the person you love. Iused to get\n        one single rose from a guy Idated last year. It seemed so much more\n        thoughtful than a bouquet. Igot so much more excited than Iwould with\n        more than one. Iwonder why? He normally gave them to me when Iwasn't\n        expecting it... but they were also never red... he'd give me yellow or\n        pink. When Iwould see red roses from men before it just didn't hit the\n        heart. Ithink that sounds odd because every woman loves a rose. So down\n        to my favorites... Iabsolutely love Lilies. There are different types\n        that are gorgeous but even the regular hybrid colored ones just shine in\n        brilliance. Then last but not least are the silver roses. Those have a\n        hint of a blue lavender look but the smell can just melt a girl. Scent: The\n        smell of Silver roses and watermelon or vanilla type of scents. But my\n        favorite of all is a Men's Cologne: Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani Favorite Colors: Many\n        different kinds of Blues have always been my favorite (lets just say\n        turquoise and teals could be thrown in here too... yes Iam allowed to\n        cheat when it comes to colors). Forest Green (the\n        color of my truck) and Purple have been the recent colors that have\n        caught my eyes lately though. Back\n        to Main / About\n        Me"
