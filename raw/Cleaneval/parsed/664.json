Leaving affords an opportunity rare in \r\n                    my insulated world: a chance to be completely out of my depth. \r\n                    Even when I travel with someone familiar, as I did recently \r\n                    with my wife, I may find myself in situations beyond my understanding. \r\n                    In such moments, at risk, I gain the world. By 'beyond \r\n                    understanding' I mean more than a simple intellectual failing. \r\n                    The challenges of travel, after all, include the trivial, \r\n                    such as the inability to follow instructions or read street \r\n                    signs. Trivial \r\n                    problems are to be expected, they are expected. Confronting \r\n                    them, the traveler is reassured by the poverty of their scale, \r\n                    and that of their solution: buy a phrasebook, learn to read Devanagari , perform every action with the right hand. No problem. \r\n                    If I get on the wrong train at the border, I will simply go \r\n                    in a different direction. No problem. The first \r\n                    phrase I learn in many languages is no problem . No problem, \r\n                    because my life will parse itself into the paragraphs of travelers' \r\n                    narrative either way. The greater the snafu, the greater the \r\n                    dryness at its telling. 'That reminds me of this time, \r\n                    in the desert outside …' Trivial \r\n                    discomforts of dislocation are trivial because they are more \r\n                    than compensated for by the comfort the traveler takes in \r\n                    overcoming them. They do not dislodge my ego; au contraire, \r\n                    they ingratiate themselves to it with borrowed familiarity. \r\n                    They place me in a narrative: I catch myself thinking, this misunderstanding, that fiasco, \r\n                    is one I have read about. I congratulate myself that in proving \r\n                    equal to such woes, I join a fraternity of the worldly. The wisdom \r\n                    I collect from these moderate failures is only moderately \r\n                    valuable. If \r\n                    I travel and come home with only it to show, the trip was \r\n                    still worthwhile. But of \r\n                    course, if this is as far as I get, I never really left. O ccasionally, \r\n                    fortunately, the world conspires, and I am shocked into a \r\n                    moment of genuine presence. The occasion is often a personal \r\n                    failure of fundamental understanding, where understanding transcends \r\n                    the grammar of associative consciousness. A defining \r\n                    characteristic of these moments is that I get that I don't \r\n                    get it. Not getting \r\n                    it is not easy. I am a prisoner of my ego and my autosycophantic \r\n                    confidence in my own intuitions. A \r\n                    willing prisoner, for I worship my intuition. But when \r\n                    I travel in a different culture, intuition is a false god. \r\n                    One very hard to dislodge: it has features so familiar I forget \r\n                    it is there. It is woven into and underpins my ritual habits. \r\n                    It is the idol packed most carefully in my pack. Understandably: \r\n                    I want to believe that I understand where I am. But resistance \r\n                    is necessary if I am to see the world outside my simplifying \r\n                    representations of it. S o \r\n                    the situations I am interested in, that I push myself to find, \r\n                    that I most fear, are those that defy intuition and stymie \r\n                    comprehension. These are often occasions of acute humility. (One reason \r\n                    I have returned to Asia is its manifest difference. I have \r\n                    an undergraduate's hazy understanding of Orientalism, but \r\n                    I intuit that my romanticization of its difference is perhaps \r\n                    an example of it. So be it, if that's what it takes.) Traveling, \r\n                    I seek to be shocked into leaving. It is a goal in the same \r\n                    way that insight is a goal of meditative practice. Some of \r\n                    the koan-like paradoxes are parallel: how does one intentionally \r\n                    put oneself beyond intention? Beyond everything. Beyond \r\n                    home and habit. R ecently, \r\n                    my answer has been to shut up and listen . \r\n                    To sit for as long as I can, as silently as I can. Recording \r\n                    in those moments, I do not capture what I witness. I do not \r\n                    witness what I record. But the recording is preserved as a \r\n                    sign that points to what I will quickly forget. Returned \r\n                    home, my mind filled with the everyday, I have only these \r\n                    recordings. Every once a while, I remember to listen, and \r\n                    slip away. Surrounding myself with them, I remind myself to \r\n                    attend to the world. Ultimately\r\n                    this project is about sharing these things. To listen \r\n                    to my recordings is not to visit the places where they were \r\n                    made. At best, though, listening creates its own occasion \r\n                    for leaving. how to use this site artist's statement on \r\n                    leaving"

      "text": "I t \r\n                    is worth contemplating that 'the shocking' does not necessarily \r\n                    shock. In Calcutta one can tour the slums. One can sample \r\n                    compassion, perhaps in penance for the license travelers otherwise \r\n                    grant themselves. Suffering does not shock. But then, \r\n                    when has it? In my city the landscape of human suffering is \r\n                    just as real and unreal as the juxtaposed landscape of privilege. If not \r\n                    the horrific, what surprises me into what I am calling leaving? I can \r\n                    answer only for myself: the unexpected detail and the unexpected \r\n                    kindness. The minutia of human behavior or natural phenomena \r\n                    visible only to the lucky voyeur. That which is unobserved \r\n                    when, as I usually am, I am in perpetual physical and mental \r\n                    motion. The revelation of alien patterns of assumption and \r\n                    expectation as deep as my own. I once explained my occasional struggle to escape the illusion \r\n                    of comprehension this way. I envision myself wearing an iron \r\n                    and leather harness. Radiating out from this harness are many \r\n                    branches. At the end of each is ensconced a burning candle. Each candle \r\n                    is an assumption, illuminating the world in a particular way \r\n                    I've learned. Try to see through the glare of candlelight. D arkness \r\n                    falls many ways. It may be thrust upon us, as on September \r\n                    11. Or, sitting still and attempting to quiet the mind, the \r\n                    candles may wink out. To be \r\n                    outside, in the dark, is to be at risk. There is often a psychic \r\n                    shock of dislocation. At times one may be at risk physically as \r\n                    well. I do not think that a condition of danger is guaranteed \r\n                    to awaken the mind. There is more to attention than adrenaline. \r\n                    One can grow as accustomed to most anything. The mind is a \r\n                    great seeker of habit, and finding it, remakes intuition to \r\n                    the new order. F inally: \r\n                    it is a privilege to willingly enter such a state of uncertainty. \r\n                    It is a greater one to have a home to return to. I am grateful \r\n                    for these things."
