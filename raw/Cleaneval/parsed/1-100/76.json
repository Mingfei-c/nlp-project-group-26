OBAM: Objective Will vs. Subjective Will \"High Science with its Formula and Results: The Interview\" Estern Howard: Hand on the Trigger Less We Forget By Mangwiro A. Sadiki “What became of the Black People of Sumer?” the traveler asked the old\r\nman, “for ancient records show that the people of Sumer were Black, what happened to\r\nthem?” “Ah”, the old man sighed. “They lost their history, so they\r\ndied...” ~ Destruction of\r\nBlack Civilization, Chancellor Williams Today, as i am held hostage inside of one of indiana’s many repressive political\r\nprisons (prisons inside of prison), i am compelled to ask a very critical question in\r\ncritiquing de situation of de Movement on this front: What has become of de organized and\r\ncollective activity that resulted from de sacrifices Comrads Balagoon and Naeem Trotter\r\nunselfishly made in 1985 when they rebelled against de racist kkkolonial army at i.s.r.\r\nfor their acts of brutality against New Afrikans and otha oppressed Peepoe’s? Is what we are seeing today de outcome of years of resistance by Revolutionaries,\r\nprogressive north amerikans, and citizens of otha oppressed nations of kolour; years of\r\nbattling neo-kkkolonial forces so We could have better living conditions or to shut down\r\nthese political prisons that are designed to carry out low-intensity warfare on those with\r\na radical politic and deny everyone their human rights?! Conditions which were so\r\nrepressive and dehumanizing that they compelled Comrad Kataza Taifa to cut of de tip of\r\nhis finger and attempt to mail it to de A.C.L.U. in protest of de barbarism being carried\r\nout at m.c.c. against kaptives? What has become of those concerned men who marched by de hundreds at i.s.r. in protest\r\nof de conditions at m.c.c. and to show solidarity for those being victimized there? This\r\npeaceful march around de wall at recreation resulted in de entire kkkamp being locked down\r\nand dozens of progressive elements being transferred to otha kkkamps thruout de state, but\r\nit showed We could come together across race, religions or political lines for a common\r\npurpose - kombating Our oppression. Where is de spirit that invoked a group of New Afrikan Freedom Fighters to speak out\r\nagainst - what was at that time - de upcoming legal lynching of Comrad Brotha Ziyon\r\nYisrayah? These souljahs, Afrika’s glorious children, would later be snatched up by\r\nracist pigs and held at gun point while being marched out of i.s.p. on to buses carrying\r\nthem to m.c.c. These souljahs would become known as de indiana 10, and later, de indiana\r\n6. There are so many more acts of heroism that could be mentioned here - too numerous to\r\nconvey in a brief article such as this. And while i’m well aware that i asked more\r\nthan one question, i felt it was necessary in order to show de seriousness of Our\r\nsituation. Is de low tide in de prison struggle here in indiana due to de “fact” that We\r\nare nolonger being oppressed or brutalized? Are politically active prisoners nolonger\r\nbeing kept in transit or being held on behavior modification units for years and years for\r\nno otha reason than Our political views?! Are kaptives nolonger being murdered by prison\r\nofficials?! If all of these things are continuing to be perpetuated against Us, then why are We\r\nfailing to organize on a collective and principled protracted level against this madness?\r\ni’m not talking about de type of support ones are extending just to get recognition\r\nfrom a particular segment of society so they can parade around as legitimate allies of de\r\noppressed. They engage in de struggle for 30 days, then you don’t hear from them no\r\nmore! “Protracted” means on going! Our oppression is protracted, thus Our\r\nresistance too must be protracted! Now is definitely not de time to become passive or silent. Kaptives, like Greg Goodwin\r\nat i.s.p., are being murdered by prison employees. De state is instituting phone policies\r\ndesigned to further restrict and monitor de communication We have with de outside world.\r\nRacist policies such as “Zero Tolerance on Gangs” are being used to terrorize\r\nNew Afrikans - political conscious and kaptured citizens - and strip us of Our so-called\r\ngood-time, and isolate and neutralize Us. Otha oppressive policies include de new drug\r\npolicy which if a kaptive fails a urine test or is caught with any drug or tobacco\r\nparaphernalia, they could loose their visits as well as their so-called good-time.\r\nUndoubted this will become a tool used to excommunicate PP’s/POW’s from de\r\noutside world by falsely accusing political activist of drug abuse, or planting these\r\nsubstance in his assigned kkkage by pigs or their stool pigeons. Prisons are being\r\nprivatized and not only are kaptives being forced to work for slave wages, but they are\r\nalso being demanded to pay rent!!! De main purpose of revisiting de past is so We can critically assess de failures and\r\nachievements of those before Us (and de situation five minutes ago for that matter, for\r\nit’s all de past), and based upon that knowledge, arrive at a concrete overstanding\r\nof Our present conditions and develop concrete solutions for tomorrow. We must build\r\ninside organization and outside prison organization on this indiana plantation that is\r\ndesigned to address Our concerns. That will challenge these repressive policies, and\r\nindeed de legitimacy of these kkkoncentration kkkamps and de overall system of domination. We have to teach this new generation of “rebels” entering de indiana prison\r\nsystem, about de struggles and sacrifices souljahs have made. Teach them about Balagoon,\r\nShaka Shakur, Taifa, Kalonji, and so, so many othas! This will instill in them a greater\r\nappreciation of de culture of Revolutionary Nationalism, and hopefully inspire them into\r\nbecome cadre. But remember, We can’t inspire them to do nothing that We AINT doing.\r\nTherefore We must move beyond de rhetoric! If We fail to pass on de torch to de next generation, We will be singing de same sad\r\nsong that de old man sang to de traveler...”they lost their history, so they\r\ndied”! And We will have no one to blame but Ourselves. ~ From one Generation to de Next Less We Forget! ~ Mangwiro A. Sadiki NARN We Can Only Do So Much - Without\r\nYou! By Abdul-Shaheed Muslim When i first came to prison, i learned about the struggles and sacrifices that were\r\nmade by prisoners, to bring about change, before i even arrived. While in prison i have\r\nmet, and participated with, the prisoners who continue to struggle and sacrifice for\r\nchange. Over the years there have been positive changes. However, with every positive\r\nchange, the DOC does that much more to make things worst. There is much change that still needs to be made. That means there is still much\r\nstruggle and sacrifice ahead. We all know that prisons are one of many battlefields in the larger struggle for true\r\nfreedom. We prisoners can struggle each and every moment, but the fact remains we cannot\r\ndo it alone. We have to have outside support - and this support must be continuous. True,\r\nwe have some support, but, let’s be honest - it is not as it should be, nor are the\r\nvarious supporters united as they should be. The prisoners, as well as the supporters, need to put aside the petty differences that\r\nare keeping us divided - thus, not allowing a result of continuous change for the better.\r\nLet us not fool ourselves, we are being watched. We prisoners know how we are being\r\nwatched - and the support groups/individuals are also being watched, be it over the\r\nInternet or through various other COINTELPRO methods. They are sitting back and saying,\r\n“they cannot even unite amongst themselves, so what do we have to fear of them?” When M.C.C., in Westville, IN, first opened, prisoners were beaten, chained to beds,\r\ngassed, etc. because of their striving to make a difference. There was a little bit of\r\nunorganized outside support. Many of these were newly formed groups that came to be\r\nbecause of M.C.C., many of the “big”, well known, groups were not really (better\r\nread truly) interested in being involved. However, when prisoners started starving\r\nthemselves and a prisoner cut off his finger tip, and M.C.C. started getting national\r\nmedia attention - then all kind of groups wanted to support the prisoners. Does all of that have to happen again, before the prisoners on the G.-A.S., S.H.U. and\r\nvarious other control units, get the support - a unified support - they deserve? Right now i happen to be on the G.-A.S. unit, and much needs to be done for the\r\nprisoners on the unit. So, i will speak about that. We are not allowed to take the G.E.D.\r\nor get substance abuse and anger management help. These are things prisoners must have to\r\nregain “lost good time” or receive even a chance of a sentence reduction in\r\ncourt. The prisoners receive bogus conduct reports, are harassed by the guards and denied\r\nmost of the rights we are supposed to have. For example: We are supposed to have one hour\r\nof recreation daily, but most times we only get 20-45 minutes (usually 20-30 mins.). It\r\ndepends on which guards are working that day. They literally tell you, “so what, file\r\na grievance.” Most grievances are never returned or ruled on! We’ve even had a\r\nguard go so far as to tell us, “we use the grievances to wipe our asses with.”\r\n(Well... if so, i hope they get some paper cuts on their rearend and the ink causes an\r\ninfection). i could go on and on about the things occurring on this unit, but it would\r\ntake up pages of this newsletter, so i will move on. Beatings of prisoners by guards is a major and growing problem throughout the state of\r\nIndiana, especially on the control units of SHU, NSB, DS, MSU, MCC and D-cell house. Many of the prisoners being beaten are the mentally ill and political prisoners (many\r\nare harassed and singled out for physical assault because of their filing complaints and\r\nlitigation against prison officials and guards). Our lives here in Indiana DOC are not\r\nsafe due to the extreme conditions and the possibility of brutality we must face daily. We are fed up with this injustice. Are you? We call upon you, the people, to be real\r\nwith us and with yourselves. Please contact the prisoners who write in this newsletter for\r\nmore detailed info about what is occurring on the units they live in. Continuously contact\r\nthe elected legislative members, the governor, members of the news media and the Indiana\r\nDOC and let them know that you are aware of the gross lack of regard for our rights as\r\nhuman beings - and that you will not stand for it (then, once you do this, please do not\r\nstand for it!) Help us expose the wrongs, the conditions, the racism and the brutality\r\nagainst prisoners in the Indiana DOC - and demand that an independent investigation is\r\ninitiated into the beatings and assaults (past and present) of prisoners by guards (i know\r\nof these personally, i have the scars to show it does occur). We call upon you to assist and help us now - not after a prisoner has been resorted to\r\nstarving himself, cutting off a finger (or been beaten to death by guards, which will\r\noccur eventually - again), because they need your assistance. We prisoners continue to look back at yesterday - and seeing tomorrow. What do we do\r\nnext? Please support prisoners. We can only do so much - without you! Abdul-Shaheed Muslim #855090 (10-4C) P.C.F. PO Box 30 Pendleton, IN 46064 In Memory of Ziyon By Gamba Mateen Rastafari To: All concerned, We are approaching de third anniversary of de deliberate ~ murder ~ execution of Ziyon\r\nIshvah Yisrayah; for on July 18-99, is de date de state of indiana along with de indiana\r\nstate prison, Al Parke, Barry Nothstine, cpt.ast. now Buss, to name a few, began\r\nimplementing a biological-chemical warfare program. Ziyon as we know him still in our hearts and minds, was murdered by lethal injection,\r\nde first person to be murdered by these diabolic chemicals within de state of indiana. Let\r\nit be remembered dat dese people experimented on our comrade-Ndugu, de whole process\r\n(execution) took one hour and thirty seven minutes. Even though Ziyon had small veins it\r\nshouldn’t take that long. Let us take dis day and reflect upon de goodness-fruitiness of dis Askari, Ziyon was a\r\npolitical prisoner - prisoner of war, but most of all a spiritual foundation’ed man,\r\nhis heart was one with da Father-Universe and people. Many things can be said about dis man, but let us reflect upon our own interpretation\r\nof de fruitfulness of dis man. I’m requesting dat any people with some type of awareness and opposed de death\r\npenalty, to join in a one day fast in remembrance of our fallen comrade. Your support\r\nwould be greatly appreciated. In memory of Ziyon You remain in our hearts Gamba Mateen Rastafari - The Kosovo Kontradiction - By Bro. F.U. It’s been (50) years since the U.Shas went to Europe + butchered other Europeans\r\n(note: the last being nazi-occupied Germany). Ironically the U.S. got involved in world\r\nwar II for the same reason why they’ve gotten involved with Kosovo. It was O.K. for\r\nthe demon Hitler to hit neighboring fronts like Poland, Denmark, Italy and even France.\r\nBut, once he’d started to hit Britain with “fly-by’s” it had become a\r\nwhole other story. it was O.K. for Hitler’s government to butcher millions of\r\nso-called “undesirables” in Germany while still trading with the U.Sdictators.\r\nBut, once he’d began to bomb + butcher Britain/England, again, it had become a whole\r\nother story. The U.S. felt that it’s mad-brother Hitler had made a violatable move by\r\npounding on the “mother land” of the pirates, pilgrims, + settlers who’d\r\nstolen the land from the natives 400-odd years ago in what’s now called\r\n“America”. These “outcasts” were considered the scum of England, yet\r\nit didn’t take away the fact that the average Euro-settler in the U.S. is a direct\r\ndescendant of England/Britain. Thus; Hitler had violated by “slapping” the U.S.\r\ndictators mother (i.e. Britain/England). Thus; he had to be dealt with and he was. Besides\r\nthis; the U.S. felt that there was no room for two world rulers. So, again; he had to be\r\ndealt with. Now; in 1999 we have “Milosevic”. An individual who’s all for taking out\r\nany ethnic group in his region who’s either of Turkish descent, Islamic in way of\r\nlife, or both. Using the invasion of the Turkish (Turkey) Empire hundreds of years ago as\r\nhis excuse for butchering not only the men, but babies, women, + elders. Three of the most\r\nvulnerable targets in any war. Giving his troops the O.K. to cross over to neighboring\r\nregions + taking over. Sounds familiar? The U.S. got involved not because it cared about the refugees. For over (4) years the\r\nU.S. government ignored the butchering of refugees in that region by Milosovic. Question:\r\nSince when has the U.Sgovernment cared about Muslims being butchered? Answer: Never! So,\r\nwhy now? Because the massacre had gotten too wide spread + other parts of Europe were beginning\r\nto receive some “disturbing” news about Kosovo. This was bound to “leak\r\nout” due to how even the most poorest regions in Europe were/are allowed to plug into\r\nthe media satellites that’s governed by the U.S. + Britain. Unlike regions of color\r\nwho are barely allowed to plug into such media-satellites, let alone launch their own\r\nmedia-satellites into space. The U.Shad begun to see that slowly but surely\r\nMilosevic’s government was moving closer + closer towards other European regions.\r\nThus; causing more than just “local” strife in that region. The so-called\r\npresident/representative of the U.S. had made it clear during his national address on the\r\nday before he’s given his trained butchers/military the O.K. to launch a bombing\r\ncampaign on Kosovo, that the U.S. was concerned about an “united Europe” + that\r\nMilosevic was dividing the Europeans house. Now let’s try to draw out some wisdom\r\nfrom these words. For the past (50) years Europe as a whole has been “major conflict” free.\r\nUntil recently with the kontradiction in Bosnia & Kosovo. For the past (50) years the\r\nU.S., Britain, Germany, France, + Russia have been fueling internal conflicts in regions\r\nof color (i.e. Korea, Afrika, Mexico, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Palestine, Iraq, Iran,\r\nKuba, Peru, Hawaii, Japan, China, etc.). Causing brother/sister to turn on their own\r\nimage/people. Dismantling whole tribes in the rain forests. Slave labor in Indonesia.\r\nForced sterilization of women of color or they’ll receive no work in the NIKE\r\nfactories, etc. Causing mischief from one corner of our planet to the next. While most of\r\nEurope felt + acted like it was “safe” + war free. Now that Milosevic’s tested his long arm tactic, threatening the\r\n“stableness” of Europe; he must be dealt with. Because it’s hard (too hard)\r\nfor the U.S. & Britain in particular to focus both on dictating + causing mischief in\r\nregions of color while their foreparents lands (Europe) dismantling. This is too much for\r\nthe mischief makers (i.e. U.S., Britain, France, etc.)... So now we’ve got reactionary nations dropping bombs + guiding/misguiding missiles\r\nall over Europe (note: while still doing fly-by’s daily on Iraq). As of today (June\r\n13, 1999) Nato ground butchers are marching thru Kosovo. This is a part of the so-called\r\ncease fire agreement that Milosevic supposedly agreed to. Already Serb troops have\r\nexchanged fire with Nato ground troops. And Russia’s ground troops have been accused\r\nof blocking off the Nato troops with their tanks. Question: When was the last time U.S.\r\nmilitary troops have met “face to face” on the battle field with Russia’s\r\narmy? Answer: Never! Both nations are used to supplying other regions with weapons to\r\nfight in their name. But never have the (2) actually met face to face on a battle field.\r\nFinally “the eagle meets the bear”. This so-called “agreement” is just\r\nthe next stage that’s being set for yet some more kontradictions. Those of you who\r\nare taking a deep sigh of relief due to the so-called agreement, don’t become too\r\nlaxed. Because we’re dealing with masters of tricknometry. The smoking glass + mirror\r\nillusionists. The now you see it, now you don’t masters. David Copperfield’s a\r\nmere baby to what we’re dealing with. But, sign’s and symbol’s are for the\r\nconscious/aware mind. For the nodder/sleeper will surely miss the mark. Just a thought. - Peace Be Unto You All - One Luv! Bro F.U.

This prison struggle is a 24-7-365 get down, but\r\nalot of prisoners at the SHU is talking that talk, but not walking that walk. So my\r\ncriticism was directed at the SHU (not all) and our nation in general. All your questions are legitimate ones, and will have to be answered in order for Us to\r\ncombat these actions, but first and foremost We must recognize the elements which is\r\nperpetrating and deal with it/them etc., etc. i stand on what i said about the “old\r\nguard” i’m not coming from a “elitist” point of view, but from a point\r\nof view that overstands that Our people do need leadership, and in this leadership there\r\nis no big I’s, and little U’s, but by that same token the younger rad’s of\r\nthis get down do need some sense of direction, “old guard” must step up.

Why do WE need political awareness in the land of FREE, and the home of the BRAVE? Why do WE view a few “token” privileges as advancement for NEW\r\nAFRIKANS/OPPRESSED PEOPLE as a whole? Why do WE not execute S.C. (secure communication) when a female/male agent of\r\noppression is amongst US? Why do WE allow prisoncrats to get under OUR skin? i.e. push buttons. Why do WE not recognize the monster (imperialism) which is killing US at a faster rate\r\nthan any other nationality on this North Amerikkkan continent? Why do WE see OURSELVES as Amerikkkans when WE were enslaved by the same system that\r\nsubjected US to every inhuman act thinkable, and still doing it today? i.e. genocide.

Khaldun #874304 PO Box 557 Westville, IN 46391 The Wake Up Call By Khalfani Baye February 15, 1999 Soon the Indiana legislatures will go into session. Abill has been\r\nprepared for introduction regarding prisoner mail. This legislation is equally important\r\nfor the \"free', citizen with whom the prisoner corresponds. The plan is to bring into\r\nfruition law that will permit unimpeded searches, confiscations and copying of outgoing\r\nand incoming prisoner mail, with the previously available \"requisite\" due\r\nprocess no longer being applicable. It must be understood that the rights (limited though they are) prisoners enjoy\r\nregarding mail are also rights guaranteed to those \"free\" citizens that we\r\ncorrespond with. These rights are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution and made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to that\r\ndocument. It must be further understood that these Constitutional Amendments govern this matter.\r\nThe state is in effect attempting to circumvent these federal protections and arbitrarily\r\nsuperimpose state laws. The matter regarding prisoners’ First Amendment rights is well established. The\r\nUnited States Supreme Court has addressed this topic since 1974 and these decisions are\r\nthe landmarks by which the states must set their policies and regulations. The state\r\ncannot make any laws that “legally\" take precedent over these federal rulings. Those of us prepared to challenge this boldness by the state of Indiana need only arm\r\nourselves with the federal authorities which clearly support our position and then let the\r\nchips fall where they may. Also, it is worth mentioning that the state of Indiana's attempt to literally smother\r\nthe voices of those of us held captive, extends to those we correspond with in the\r\n\"free”, world. This attempt also violates Indiana Constitution, Article One,\r\nSection 9, 11, 15 and 18. Attached, Ihave prepared a short document regarding the historical development of\r\nprisoner First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

The First Amendment Claim The wellspring of First Amendment law regarding prisoners' legal mail can be found in a\r\n1974 United States Supreme Court decision (Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 94 S.Ct.\r\n1800 (1974)). In this case, the court upheld censorship of prisoners, mail if two criteria were met: First, the practice in question must further an important and substantial interest unrelated\r\nto the suppression of expression . Prison officials must show that a regulation\r\nauthorizing mail censorship furthers one or more of the substantial governmental interests\r\nof security, order and rehabilitation. Second, the limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessary\r\nor essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved, i.e.\r\nsecurity, order and rehabilitation. The case of Martinez was construed and applied again in 1979. (Bell v. Wolfish, 441f\r\nU.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979)). In this case the court approved a \"publishers only\" rule that prohibited\r\nprisoners from receiving hardcover books from any source other than publishers, book\r\nclubs, and book stores. Eight years later, 1987, the Supreme Court considered Martinez again. (Turner v.\r\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987)). In this case, the court held that a prison regulation that impinges on prisoners,\r\nrights is valid if it is \"reasonably related to legitimate penological\r\ninterests\". The court backed off the language in Martinez, the Turner court listed four factors by\r\nwhich to assess a regulation's reasonableness: 1) the existence of a valid, rational\r\nconnection between the regulation and the interest used to justify it; 2) the existence of\r\nother methods by which prisoners can exercise the asserted right; 3) the impact on\r\nprisoners, and prison resources in general, if the right is accommodated; and 4) the\r\nabsence of ready alternatives to the regulation. The Supreme Court again returned to the topic of prisoner correspondence in 1989.\r\n(Thornburgh v. Abbott, 49 U.S. 413, 19 S.Ct. 1874 (1989)). This was, in short, a return to\r\n1974 and Martinez. This court carefully noted that Martinez did not announce a \"least restrictive\r\nmeans\" test for prisoner mail, but the analytical point most significant to the\r\nMartinez decision was that the earlier delision had dealt with outgoing mail, while Thornburgh\r\ninvolved incoming mail . With regard to outgoing mail, the court observed: \"Dangerous outgoing\r\ncorrespondence is more likely to fall within readily identifiable categories: examples\r\nnoted in Martinez include escape plans, plans relating to ongoing criminal activity, and\r\nthreats of blackmail or extortion.\" The court then seemed to reestablish the Martinez standard for outgoing mail while\r\nlimiting the Turner Standard (1987), to incoming mail. The court makes this clear when\r\nthey write, \"As we do not here apply the Martinez Standard,\"; the implication is\r\nthat the earlier standard, as now clarified, does not apply in cases of incoming mail\r\nsuch as Turner, but still retains vitality. That vitality can only be with reference to\r\noutgoing mail. Still, the standard for assessing interference with prisoners' outgoing mail is not\r\nentirely clear (e.g. United States v. Workman, 80 f.3d 688, 698-99 (2nd. Cir. 1996)).\r\n(\"Where good cause is shown, outgoing mail can be read without violating prisoners'\r\nFirst Amendment rights\", noting that \"Turner ... is considerably more\r\ndeferential to restraints imposed by prison officials on prisoner rights than the standard\r\nof Martinez\") B . The Due Process Claim The United States Supreme Court dealt with this topic in 1981 and again in 1984. The\r\ncourt made the Constitutional protections clear (Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 101 S.Ct.\r\n1908 (1981) and Hudson v. Paimer, 468 U.S. 517, 531, 104 S. et. 3194, 3203 (1984)). The\r\ncourt held: The Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a\r\nstate employee deprives an individual of property, without making available a meaningful\r\npost deprivation remedy. IT’S NOW OR NEVER By Herman Averhart-Bey Today just as was the case thirty years ago when the Black Panther Party first emerged,\r\nthe New African (Black) communities remain colonized communities that are controlled from\r\nthe outside by the capitalist bourgeoisie who in turn use New Afrikan (Black)\r\ncollaborators, petit-bourgeoisie, opportunists, and domestic neo-colonialists to control\r\nthe communities from the inside with their pacification programs designed to mislead the\r\noppressed in the interest of imperialist hegemony. These imperialist lackies, reformists,\r\nand revisionists are enemies of the oppressed masses and must be stopped at all costs and\r\nby any means necessary in order for the colonized and exploited masses to break the chains\r\nof neo-slavery. But first and foremost in the New Afrikan (Black) liberation struggle, the lumpen and\r\nlumpen proletariat must break with parasitism, but they are not alone. There are many\r\nconscious revolutionaries and those proclaiming leadership and elitism that must also\r\nbreak from the chains of parasitism, which means disunity with any and everyone that\r\ncan't, won't, or refuse to break with parasitism, and this too must be done by any means\r\nnecessary. In the struggle for national and international liberation, there is no room for the\r\nelitist mentality. There are no big I's and little u's. There is no better than the next.\r\nThere is only conscious, quasi-conscious, and unconscious. There is only teacher and\r\nstudent (and we are all both teacher and student). There is only the revolutionary and\r\ncounter-revolutionary. In the struggle for national and international liberation, we are\r\nall oppressed and colonized people just the same, and as lumpen and lumpen proletariat we\r\nhave a common enemy in capitalism, imperialism, fascism, zionism, racism, exploitation,\r\ngenocide, and oppression (i.e. class, race, sex. gender, and religion). So how can anyone\r\nhave an elitist mentality? Only those chained to parasitism entertain or consider the\r\nthought of the elitist mentality, which goes to make any such person no more than\r\nopportunist and counter-revolutionary. As we draw nearer to the year 2000 and the next millennium in the struggle for national\r\nand international liberation and self-determination, the oppressed and ex- ploited masses\r\nwithin the colonized communities of imperialist amerikkka are continuously being\r\nterrorized, brutalized, and murdered daily by the fascist, patrolling, colonial\r\noccupational personnel (cops) and racists. The capitalist bourgeoisie still control the\r\npolitics and economics of our communities by way of the New Afrikan (Black) collaborators,\r\npetit-bourgeoisie, opportunists, and domestic neo-colonialists who serve the interests of\r\nthe racist, exploiting, and imperialistic cliques of settleristic America. This\r\nEuro-Amerikan settleristic nation of amerikkka is the foundation and home base of\r\ncapitalism and imperialism, and leads the world in acts of terrorism, exploitation, and\r\ngenocide, and must be smashed by whatever means necessary. The lumpen and lumpen proletariat of the colonized conscious left, by being colonized\r\nwithin the belly of capitalism and imperialism, are in the best of strategic positions,\r\nmore than any of the world's people, to strike a crucial and shattering blow to the very\r\nheart and soul of capitalism and imperialism. As long as capitalism and imperialism are\r\nallowed to go unchecked from within its amerikkkan base, it continues getting stronger as\r\nit conquers more of the world's territory and practices genocide on more of the world's\r\npeople, while those of the conscious left within the very borders of imperialist amerikka\r\nwatch it carry out its policies of massive de- struction. It is long past time to stop fooling ourselves and prolonging the ineluctable\r\nconclusion. It's clear that the liberation struggle is a protracted struggle, but it's\r\nalso clear that the New Afrikan (Black) liberation struggle has been going on since the\r\nfirst slave was kidnapped. And as we engage in our over-extended, protracted struggle, we,\r\nas a New Afrikan (Black) people, are being imprisoned and placed on death rows by the\r\nthousands and murdered in our homes and in the streets of imperialist amerikkka. The time\r\nhas come to intensify the national an international liberation struggle within the borders\r\nof imperialist settleristic amerikkka. What the Panthers do more than anything else is\r\nthey set a standard that young black people particularly want to measure up to--It's a\r\nstandard of ag- gressiveness, of militance, of just forcefulness, the sort of standard we\r\nhaven't had in the past. Our idols have been Dr. King who, for all of his beauty as a man\r\nwas not an aggressive man, but the Panthers and Ithink Malcolm X, have set this new kind\r\nof standard that a great many people want to adhere to. ~ Julian Bond, April 1970 All power to the people! H. Averhart-Bey # 900086 W.V.C.F./SHU A6-106 P.O. Box 1111 Carlisle, In 47838 THE OFFICIAL MONEY SCAM WITH INTEREST By Zolo Agona Azania Prison is big business. Money and slave labor, after a captive person has been duly\r\nconvicted and sentenced in a court of law, is at the root of this foul business. Recently a new Business Administrator Mrs. Phyllis F. Newkirk, has been installed at\r\nthe Indiana State Prison. As business administrator she is the figurehead responsible for\r\nthe coordination and control of fiscal recording and processing. Money received at an\r\nadult prison from a source outside the department of correction shall be in the form of a\r\npostal money order, certified or cashier's cheek or government check. The wardens and\r\nbusiness administrators at each prison shall be held in strict accounting for all money\r\nheld in trust for a prisoner. I.C. 4-24-6-1 et seq. The funds on deposit in the prisoners\r\nTrust Fund Account are invested in Federally Insured Banks or Savings and Loan\r\nInstitutions. According to the Administrative Procedures Manual of Policies and Procedures of the\r\ndepartment of correction and state law, the interest shall be deposited in the Prisoner's\r\nRecreation Fund no less than quarterly. The Prisoner’s Trust Fund Balance Sheet is\r\nsuppose to show any interest accrued and transferred to the recreation Fund monthly. But\r\nthe prisoners are never advised or notified how much interest is accrued on their money. The officials are enforcing a bogus policy to prevent the captives from receiving money\r\nfrom anybody who is not listed on their visitor list. But there is no actual policy as\r\nsuch. It appears to me that these prison officials have devised a long term conspiracy to\r\nfurther isolate the captives from support by preventing them from communicating with\r\npeople on the outside through letters, among other things. A Prelude to this Incidious goal is perpetrated by rejecting all money received at the\r\nprison for a captive from a person whose name is not on their approved visitor list. This\r\nunderhanded ploy also undermines a captive’s visiting privilege because a\r\nvisitor’s name would have to be displaced on his or her list who might want to\r\nphysically visit a particular captive, merely for somebody else to be placed on their list\r\nto send them a little money once in a while."

Sincerely, Zolo Agona Azania #4969 c.c. file (2) Praying for a Miracle By Talib Becktemba Revolutionary Greetings; Ihave never been one to believe in miracles because i believe that human beings shape\r\nand control other human interactions. But as i evolve in this ever changing world and\r\nwitness the madness which affects us all, i am beginning to think that a miracle is just\r\nwhat it is going to take to transform some of these reactionaries into responsible and\r\nrespectable human beings who are committed to national struggles aimed at liberating New\r\nAfrika. We are confronted with so much difficulty within the course of Our daily lives that the\r\nsimple act of living is becoming a real chore. Iuse to wonder why some people would pray\r\nwhen confronted with various difficult situations because i know that there can never be\r\nany substitute for concrete struggles in its many manifestations. But when i realized that\r\nsome of Us are not praying for some god’s intervention into Our social realities, but\r\nthat they are praying for the strength and courage to struggle on because at moments in\r\nOur lives Our conditions become almost unbearable. Our systematic oppression, repression,\r\ndeprivation, and the colonial violence that We experience daily has effected the very\r\nfiber of Our being. Some of you may think that We are powerless to make a change and “to you” i\r\nsay that you don’t know your own strength. That power that We truly possess if We can\r\nget past all of Our petty differences and develop a love and concern for each other\r\nnationally as We collectively confront Our national crisis. And some of you may indeed\r\nbelieve that it is going to take a miracle to get past all of Our internal differences to\r\ndo this work together. But all it will truly take is the personal commitment of each one\r\nof Us to make this change and unite in common struggle. The miracle of change exists in each one of Us and all We have to do is realize Our own\r\npotential and work together instead of continuing to destroy Us all with Our individual\r\ndisplays of savagery. We have to rise above all this madness because it’s a new day. Uhuru Talib Becktemba Milk... By Imn Rasl Why would one species need the milk of another species? Cows drink cow’s milk,\r\ngoats drink goat’s milk, dogs drink dog’s milk. So, shouldn’t human beings\r\ndrink human being milk? That would seem more logical than humans drinking cow’s milk\r\nor goat’s milk. How common is it for a lion to drink milk from a female zebra?\r\nIt’s just not within its nature to do so. Picture a human being being breast feeding\r\nor being breast fed by a cow or goat. How silly does that seem? How many full grown\r\nanimals (e.g. bears, dogs, deer, lions, mooses, cows) do you know of that drink milk? Once we are weaned from the nipple there is no need for us to continue drinking our\r\nmother’s breast milk. If there was a need for humans to drink milk after we reach a\r\ncertain age then don’t you think human milk would be sold in gallon jugs at our\r\nneighborhood grocery stores? Let’s use some common sense for a moment.... When a\r\nchild is born its little bones aren’t quite strong enough. This is why it is unable\r\nto stand on its own or hold certain object of weight. This is also why the child must be\r\nbreast fed by its mother to receive the calcium it needs for stronger bones and\r\ndevelopment. Once the child reach 10-12 months old, its bones are usually strong enough to\r\nsupport its body weight, walk, and hold heavier objects, thus the child soon out grows the\r\nneed to be breast fed. Some babies are fed animal’s milk instead of its own mother’s natural milk.\r\nSimilac, and infantmeal are milk like formulas that are fed to new born babies as a\r\nsubstitution for its mother’s breast milk. The child is usually fed these kinds of\r\nformulas for a short time before being switched to cow’s milk. This cow’s milk\r\nis consumed from childhood to adulthood without the realization that it isn’t needed\r\nfor our growth and development anymore, not to mention the fact that it’s not for\r\nhuman consumption period. We see milk commercials and billboard signs advertising milk from cows as if its\r\nnatural for human beings to drink. Acommon phrase that we see and hear is, “Got\r\nmilk?” or “Drink milk, it does a body good”. But how could it do the body\r\ngood when it’s a known cause for colon cancer, more common amongst black people. It\r\nhas a number of ill effects on the digestive system such as, stomach bloating, excessive\r\ngas, intestinal complications, bowel disfunctions, constipation and of course the list\r\ngoes on. But let the farm industries tell it, it’s all good for us to consume this\r\nproduct. It’s all about the almighty dollar in this country and for the profit makers\r\n(capitalist) it matters not who’s health is effected later on in life by it. To the\r\nfarm industries, it all make sense. Let’s be real about this. Imean, how can something be both good and bad at the\r\nsame time for our bodies? What sense does it make to have “strong bones” yet, on\r\nthe other hand have serious digestive and intestinal complications which can and often\r\ntimes will lead to colon cancer? It just doesn’t add up. But of course it does (add\r\nup $$$$$$$) for the capitalist farmers of this country. It’s not beyond belief that\r\nif women could produce milk like cows and goats, her milk would be sold in cartons and\r\ngallon jugs at the corner grocery stores. Now imagine that.... Imn Rasl #854623 D-326-West Indiana State Prison PO Box 41 Michigan City, IN 46361-0041 Objective Will vs. Subjective Will By OBAM 6/12/99 The normal and prevalent belief is that we, homosepiens, the human species, are at the\r\ntop of the food chain. This can hardly be disputed. It is also a well established belief\r\nthat we are of a higher intelligence than all other forms of life and given dominion over\r\nall other species by God himself. Our “will” is thought to be for the most part independent as opposed to being\r\na result of socialization. The common belief among the populous (mostly ignorant to even\r\nthe basics of psychology) and even some social scientists is that even though environment\r\nplays a significant role in determining a person’s personality, character, morals,\r\nvalues, ethics, etc., that which will prevail over social indoctrinations is\r\n“independent will”. I’m sure you’ve heard many times statements to the\r\neffect of, “Iunderstand he had a childhood of abuse, drugs, violence, poverty, etc.,\r\nbut he knew right from wrong, and he ‘chose’ to do wrong”. These are\r\nstatements often made by prosecutors, victims and their families. You can even hear this\r\nsentiment voiced among those on the flip side of this equation - prisoners themselves. You\r\nalso hear, “Icame up in the ghetto, too, but ‘I’ didn’t turn to drugs\r\nand crime.” Well, Irespect their honesty if that’s indeed what it is, but it is\r\nderived from ignorance; ignorance of the dynamics of the mind; ignorance of human nature. Morals, values, and ethics, relatively, are not passed on through genes and are not a\r\npart of our “mental wiring”. However, mental wiring does play a part in how\r\nsharp or dull we are in perception and cognition. Genetics and the quality of prenatal\r\ncare can determine to a large degree the efficiency of our brain and nervous system, i.e.,\r\nwhether we perceive slowly or quickly; our ability to decipher and remember information;\r\nwhether we have a dull character or an erratic, hyper character. All these things can be\r\ndetermined by the structure of our brain and nervous system and also by brain chemistry.\r\nThese factors are for the most part independent of direct socialization, but they do not\r\ndetermine morals, values, and ethics. These are determined by socialization, i.e., family,\r\nhome upbringing, community, school, media, church, traumatic experiences, etc.; all that\r\nenters the brain by way of the five senses. The mind is an extremely complex entity. Though we seem to live according to our\r\nconscious decisions, the subconscious mind is what dictates to our conscious mind, and the\r\nsubconscious mind is constructed second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by\r\nday, year by year from the “intake” of outside stimuli via the five senses. The\r\noverwhelming majority of information that we absorb we absorb subconsciously (without\r\nbeing aware of it), nevertheless it is absorbed and becomes a part of our subconscious\r\ninfluencing our emotions, values, ethics, etc., hence, our conscious decisions. Take\r\nethics in particular; the standard of what is right and just as distinct from wrong and\r\nevil. One may well know that certain activities are wrong “according to the law and\r\nthe mainstream moral standards”, but in his/her “own community and culture”\r\nthese activities are prevalent and accepted practices, and eventhough one knows that they\r\nare illegal and immoral, because of the manner in which they are portrayed, consciously\r\nand subliminally, the propensity for one to partake in these activities is much greater.\r\nThere are many variations, and one rule doesn’t apply to each and every individual\r\nsituation, but the only way you can miss my point is to be mentally deficient or either in\r\nextreme denial. Given different circumstances and a different upbringing, you could very\r\nwell be just like the person you despise the most. For the sake of argument, let’s say that everyone does have an independent will.\r\nHow then could you explain ones choosing to do wrong? Either they are bad by nurture or\r\nthey are bad by nature. It’s as simple as that. There’s no other alternative or\r\nexplanation. The opponents of my theory would have to argue that it is nature, because\r\nthey are opposed to the theory of nurture (socialization) as a cause of one being bad,\r\nevil, a social menace, etc. Now, if a person is bad by nature as opposed to nurture, how\r\ncan they be held accountable for their bad conduct? Think critically before attempting to\r\nanswer this question if you’ve never ventured on these grounds before. If a person is\r\nindeed a bad or evil person, Ipersonally do not believe that it is by nature. Istand on\r\nthe theory of socialization. This is not a crutch, an excuse, a scapegoat, etc.; it’s\r\na fact. No doubt, many misuse and abuse this theory as a scapegoat to further their\r\npersonal interest taking away from the legitimacy of the argument when presented under\r\nserious circumstances. To put this issue of psychology into a political, revolutionary perspective, let me\r\nbegin by stating that psychology is an integralcomponent of politics, revolutionary\r\npolitics in particular. Governmental policy (politics) influences social norms and\r\nculture, and social norms and culture in turn influence governmental policy, but the\r\nformer is the primary focus. Today in the U.S. we see the fanatical religious, right-wing blaming the so-called\r\nliberals for the country’s moral decay. In particular “Newt” blamed the\r\nliberals for the mass murder committed by the two teens at Columbine Highschool in\r\nColorado. On the one hand these hypocrites condemn “big government” especially\r\nwhen it interferes with big business, but on the other hand they seek to repress and\r\ncontrol every aspect of our personal lives. They seek to set the standards for proper\r\nfamily structure, family values, education, religion, responsible media, correct\r\nconstitutional interpretation, etc. and condemn all other opinions. The same restrictions of personal freedoms that are in practice now in this country are\r\nthe same restrictions of personal freedoms that this government was condemning so-called\r\ncommunist and socialist countries for ten, twenty, thirty years ago. Only here,\r\nthey’re called “social contracts”, i.e. anti-crime laws, war on drugs, gun\r\nsafety and control, etc. The U.Ssupreme court recently ruled that it was unconstitutional to prohibit\r\n“citizens” from hanging out on the streets simply because they appeared to be\r\ngang members. This has been in practice in Chicago since the early 90s. Eventhough it was\r\nruled unconstitutional, you can believe they’ll come up with something just as\r\nrepressive if not more so. As for their laissez faire (hands off big business) policy, you can bet that it’s\r\nnot for the purpose of promoting equality in the free market. It is exclusively for the\r\npurpose of furthering the accumulation of wealth into the hands of a few - monopoly\r\ncapitalism. The populous are blind to these facts, and even worse, many wouldn’t really care a\r\ngreat deal if they knew the reality of it all. The social institutions, i.e. media,\r\neducational system, religion, entertainment, etc. shape our ethics, values, etc. more now\r\nthan ever, because they are becoming more and more intrusive into our personal lives. Many\r\nsay you can’t legislate morals. Isay that legislation impacts social institutions,\r\nand social institutions impact morals, but no amount of legislation can overwhelm or\r\ncorrect the effects of capitalism that have degraded all that is spiritually sound and\r\nlife loving. It takes revolution. As Istated before, governmental policy, or lack there of, can influence social norms\r\nand culture. For instance, the government’s economic policy of laissez faire\r\n(allowing the market to proceed with little or no anti-trust protection) inevitably leads\r\nto the accumulation of the overwhelming majority of wealth and power into the hands of a\r\nsmall power elite and an ever increasing poverty class of despair creating a culture of\r\ncrime, violence, drugs, cut-throat individualism, ignorance, etc. The government’s\r\npolicy of refusing to prosecute clear cut cases of police brutality and corruption creates\r\na sentiment towards the C.O.P. (colonial occupational personnel) and the state of\r\nuntrustworthiness and vindictiveness to say the least, especially among poor people and\r\npeople of color while in turn creating a sentiment towards the cops and state among the\r\nupper class and most whites of patriotic protectors. The government’s policy of\r\nmisrepresenting history, especially in the academic and religious fields contributes to\r\nthe cultural perception of white superiority and black inferiority. The governmental\r\npolicies that give less opportunities to females, mainly economic opportunities,\r\nautomatically reinforces the already established culture of sexism, female subservience\r\nand inferiority - patriarchy. Each of these examples is a part of the U.S. capitalist culture in large part as a\r\nresult of governmental policy. These are major yet general examples, however the same\r\n“cause and effect” principle applies to individual situations, but are connected\r\nto the general culture. It’s been said quite frequently that prisons are microcosms of that society at\r\nlarge. The highest rates per capita of crime, murder in particular, suicide, imprisonment\r\nare in the U.S., and it is the only developed, industrialized nation in the world that\r\nstill has the death penalty, yet it is called the greatest democracy in the world. Well,\r\nlet me say this: Ademocracy is only as strong as the people’s level of political\r\nconsciousness. The people (proletariat) can not truly dictate if they do not truly\r\noverstand the science of society, politics and economics. They can only be dictatees;\r\npawns in the game of the power elite, voting for illusions. You ask, “how does all this relate to the title?” An unconscious person makes\r\ndecisions from a subjective will that is controlled by those in control of that particular\r\nenvironment. The following is an analogy stated quite proficiently by Mr. Hoover: “Having a subjective will is like being in someone else’s dream. Adream in\r\nwhich you have no power to create the scenes or change them. Let’s imagine that the\r\ndream is about life and the dreamer is able to make the laws and change the laws or he can\r\nmake ‘new laws’ to hold you in check if you begin to win in his game of life. He\r\ncould make you rich and famous or he could make you a wino, drug addict or a criminal\r\n(according to his law). In his dream, you are used to his ends. Your actions would only be\r\nreactions that he could control, calculate and predict and when he has no more use for\r\nyou, he could eliminate you from his dream. Or he may just decide to store you away in\r\nsome sort of ‘warehouse’ for his future use. Or perhaps he will supply you with\r\ndrugs and guns and let you smoke and shoot your way out of existence.” From the Blue\r\nPrint In order for capitalism or any other type of repressive, corrupt system to persist and\r\nthrive, the mass majority of the people must be of a subjective will. As Istated earlier, a democracy is only as strong as the people’s level of\r\nconsciousness. Democracy is synonymous with socialism, and in order for true socialism to\r\nexist, the people must be of an objective will which entails being conscious of\r\nsociety/environment and its ability to indoctrinate so they won’t be subject to that\r\nindoctrination. An objective will also entails the ability to shape the environment as\r\nopposed to being shaped by the environment. Now you may ask, “why would Iworry about\r\nbeing negatively indoctrinated if the system is socialist?” The answer: Eventhough a\r\nsystem may be socialist, in the interest of the populous, there is always a latent force\r\nlurking internally and/or externally seeking to overthrow the status quo. There are\r\ncontradictions to everything. This is the law of dialectics. Hence, what is necessary to\r\nkeep the forces of capitalism and other corrupt systems from overcoming socialism is not\r\nonly a conscious people but a system that systematically instills consciousness in the\r\npeople via the social institutions, i.e. education, religion, entertainment, etc. This is\r\nrevolutionary scientific socialism. You can not disconnect an individual’s actions and thoughts from the society and\r\nculture at large, and you can not disconnect culture and society at large from\r\ngovernmental policy. What may appear to be an isolated incident may very well soon become\r\nan epidemic; hence know this: Apeople’s collective will is a direct result of the\r\ntype of system under which those people live. True socialism - the objective will of a conscious people - is what we struggle for. In Global Solidarity, OBAM s/n Marc A.Tillman #940972 P.C.F. PO Box 30 Pendleton, IN 46064 “High Science with its Formula and\r\nResults: The Interview.” Introduction: This interview is given by: Rasuual Byrd-Bey. Iwill be interviewing my brotha man\r\nOlugbala Pili.Suggs, on the matters of what one must have to consider their self. Ascientist, one who is conscious in deeds.. Byrd-Bey: Brotha Olugbala, first let me say that there are some who will not be in agreement with\r\nsome of your information; that will be spoken on in this interview. What do you think of such? Olugbala: Well, we know that the Moorish Holy Koran explains this answer best. The lips of the wise are as the doors of a cabinet no sooner are they opened, but\r\ntreasures are poured out before thee! Byrd-Bey: My brotha man you answer well. So could you now tell me and others who may not know, but call ourselves scientists what\r\nscience is? Olugbala: Science is a system. It is a word taken from Latin, meaning “to know” that which\r\nwe use for knowledge, that we have collected and interpreted in a certain systematic way.\r\nWe also use the word for the process of collection and interpretation, so that a\r\n“scientist” is one who bring a formula of science; with the observation of\r\nunexplained facts Byrd-Bey: So, as the observer studies the observations what does he see? Olugbala: He sees interrelationships and patterns, but she generalizes a pattern to cover unobserved\r\nfacts, and he devises a tentative explanation of the pattern. A “Hypothesis.” Byrd-Bey: What does one do with this hypothesis you speak on? Olugbala: One then test the hypothesis on new observations with a planned experiment. And if the\r\nexperiment fails to confirm the hypothesis, the observers must formulate a new hypothesis\r\nand conduct another experiment. If that experiment does confirm the hypothesis; then the\r\nhypothesis becomes a part of the observer’s collection of “knowledge”.\r\nThrough repeated conformations along with success in helping to explain new observations\r\npromotes a hypothesis to the highest level of facts, principle, law and theory; Byrd-Bey: Could you also tell me and the other readers about one (1) crucial part of the scientific\r\nmethod? Olugbala: One (1) crucial part of the scientific method is (“caution”)\r\nresearchers-”seeker” go to great pain to avoid the many kinds of error and bias\r\n(encouraging one outcome or answer over the other) that can contaminate experiments. We\r\nconduct controlled experiments (where everything is the same except the variable being\r\ntested) to be sure that the results we see are “real” and not unforeseen effects\r\nof our experimental setups: Further we must analyze these results with statistics. Byrd-Bey: Could you explain to me and others about another essential part of the method? Olugbala: Another essential part of the method is “communication”, the greater parts on\r\nour list. However, observation, generalization, hypothesis, and experiment are all useless\r\nif they are kept secret; let’s take a look into this by saying, a result is not a\r\nresult -- it has no validity, no (credibility gap) -- if other scientist cannot obtain the\r\nsame result. As scientists we are sure you can fill in the blanks as words were left out;\r\nThus the scientist must write and publish scientific reports that explain observations,\r\ngeneralization, hypothesis, and experiments in detail so that others who seek can repeat\r\nthe work. Byrd-Bey: Okay now, tell us what science is firmly based on? Olugbala: Well, science is firmly based on the notion of repeatability; it has little room for the\r\nunique and for those who keep their methods or findings secret, and even less room for\r\nthese individuals who manufacture false observations and experimental results. Because\r\nthis demand for repeatability means that every step of a scientist’s work must be\r\ncheckable; science possesses an accountability and duty, a dedication to truth, accuracy,\r\nand completeness that surpasses all other allegiances. Byrd-Bey: Out of all that you have covered could you tell us what the “attributes” of a\r\nscientist is? Olugbala: As a scientist your “attributes” are as important as all other formulas. a\r\nscientist seek knowledge, truth, and “human survival”. Using the scientific\r\nmethod, potential scientist need the ability to work and think methodically; we should\r\nalso have other traits because scientist in “general” are persistent, curious,\r\nprecise, intelligent, objective, honest, enthusiastic, and humble; (if their hypothesis is\r\nconfirmed right the first time.) Byrd-Bey: Well, brotha Olugbala we will wrap this interview up shortly, but let me say that it has\r\nbeen a tremendous blessing for myself to hear a lesson being taught... Nevertheless, Ihave two (2) final questions for you. How did you receive this chemistry that gives\r\nvaluable information? Olugbala: Ireceived this formula through cronyism = which means favoritism shown to old friends\r\nwithout regard for their qualifications. My good brotha-man Frank James-Bey, whom Ihonor\r\nfull-heartily, taught me much. So this Iattained from him; and through years of study. Byrd-Bey: Okay, we are now at the close of this interview, is there any good measure of last words\r\nthat you would like to say? Olugbala: Yes there is my brotha-man. Iemphasize this for the conscious ones, we must now go beyond\r\nelementary, we’re scientists the formula has been mixed with favorable\r\n“attributes” it’s time to confirm that we can be as valuable as any other\r\nculture of people. Learn that the advantages lieth not in possessing good things, but in\r\nthe knowing “to” use them. Think about this for years to come!

Like you’ve got the world in your hands, you walk erect, with a “S” on your chest, looking to shoot another human being. You’ll shoot a little boy, or girl, woman or man, it don’t matter, as long as you hear the clatter of your gun go boom. Now you’ve taken the life of someone’s wife, husband, sister, or brother. Now how would you feel if for a thrill someone killed your mother?, Father?, Sister?, Brother?, or child? Iknow, you’ll put your hand on the trigger and go buck wild! Some will call the cops, so they can cock their blocks to shoot the perpetrator down. Either way that’s another souljah that wont be around. Body count, two souljahs down, since they killed one of yours, you killed one of theirs, now neither one of you is around. Now Igot my hand on the trigger, but put your mind at ease, because my weapon of choice is my brain, so I’m shooting consciousness to anyone in need. Iknow Ican’t reach every soul that breathe, because some like my style, and try to be me. One can imitate my walk, use the words Italk, but they won’t feel what Ifeel, because a lost soul feel what they think they should, while what I’m feeling is real! My hand is on the trigger within the depth of my soul, because I’ve dismissed what was taught to me, to shoot what Iknow. Yeah, with my hand on the trigger Ifeel bigger, and my “S” stands for self, and I’m shooting consciousness to the souls Ican help. If you feel distress by the words Iexpress that’s another souljah down, because I’m gonna keep my hand on the trigger as long as I’m around! Estern Howard #871367 Haugville"
