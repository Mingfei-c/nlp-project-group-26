Don't purchase the first card hanging on the rack; if possible, get one from a location that's inaccessible to the general public. Don't purchase a card that appears to have been tampered with, or has the PIN/password exposed. Ask the cashier to scan the card after you've purchased it to confirm the card's balance reflects the amount of money you asked to have loaded on the card. Keep your receipt as proof of the time, location and amount for which the gift card was purchased."
