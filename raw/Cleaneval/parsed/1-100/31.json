      "text": "home ODPM: Living PLaces report Living Places (case studies of the urban renaissance in the South East) was jointly commissioned in 2000 by the Government Office for the South East (GOSE) and the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). The aims of the research were to: Explain why urban renaissance is important for the\r\nSouthEast, and where it is likely to be most relevant Describe what urban renaissance entails Show how different places in the South East are already\r\nimplementing various aspects of urban renaissance Draw conclusions on good practice The Living Places report is based on a comprehensive review of recent research and policy guidance on issues relating to urban renaissance and on 30 case studies of what is already being done in this field. The great majority of the case studies are drawn from the South East Region itself, although a few come from other parts of the old ROSE area (and exclude Greater London which as a world city is on a very different scale from anywhere else in the South East). The case studies have been drawn from a range of different types and sizes of towns, and from different parts of the region, so that more people will be able to find situations that they can identify with. One case study and one example\r\nhowever (both focusing on public transport) are drawn from mainland Europe. The Research Review and the case studies are contained in a separate Technical Report published on DLTR website. For more information contact Christopher Cadell in our London Office"
