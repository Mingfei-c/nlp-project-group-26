      "text": "Good news, everyone! Thanks to the generous donations from our last fundraiser , the Amarok project will soon move to a much better web server. As some of you have probably noticed, our current hosting (AMD Duron, 512MB RAM) is hopelessly underpowered for the growing traffic on amarok.kde.org . We've had a lot of downtime over the last months, especially when the site was hammered by digg.com, heise.de, etc. The new server will be a dedicated AMD Athlon 64 X2 4200+, 2 gigs of RAM, 2 x 300 GB SATA HDD, from Hetzner.de. This should provide us with enough power to survive the slashdot/digg-effect. Paleo (Olivier Bdard) will continue to be the main administrator, and, in other good news, we will continue to host a number of other KDE projects (Konversation, Akregator..) for free We will try to make the migration over the next few weeks as smooth as possible, by running the old server in parallel until everything is ready to go.

How the hell did those ugly squares appear all over the screen, is it a virus? No, it's a KDE feature! How to reproduce: Fire up a KDE application (Konqueror, Amarok, or KMail will do) and press the ctrl key. It's not even a new feature; it has been there since KDE 3.3 or somesuch. And this feature even has a name, which Ican't be bothered to look up. Questions naturally coming to my mind: How the hell could this \"feature\" pass the KDE usability team? Is the person who invented it ashamed of it? In Amarok development, whenever someone comes up with an idea like that, we'd go like: \"Dude, are you out of your mind?\" Food for thought?

However this laptop has only 512 of RAM (rather painful for compiling) and Ihad heard that Kubuntu has good laptop support. And indeed thats pretty much the case. All of my hardware was recognized: the dual-core, the wireless, the Intel graphics chip and power saving and status features are all working without any configuration. It was the easiest install I've ever done. And I'm happy with the result too, Kubuntu does a good job of putting everything together. The complaints I'm about to go into don't take away too much from this fact. The problem with Kubuntu and Ubuntu are their defaults for the repos. I'm pretty sure the fact that the default repos get better support then the 'universe' 'multiverse' etc. repos is something that is only understood by only a few. And apparently thats the entire reason for not having them on by default. So when Iwanted to install kdevelop, Iwas a little puzzled at first. Gentoo currently shines in this area, I've  only ever had to use an \"overlay\" if Iwanted to install unreleased software. The other issue I've had is with wireless network configuration (at least its not wireless driver configuration!) If there's a Kubuntu equivalent to Gentoo's /etc/conf.d/wireless Ihaven't found it. Right now wireless works if Irun wlassistant (a GUI interface to configure the wireless) try to connect, it fails, and then Irestart /etc/init.d/networking. That doesn't make too much sense, Iknow. In general their startup scripts seem to be all pretty unorganized. All written in plain /bin/sh and with no clear design (like instead of a general dependency system, there are scripts that are run before and after specifically network goes up and down). Gentoo's startup and configuration system is hardly revolutionary which Isuppose makes Kubuntu's antiquated system that much more frustrating."

This will most likely start after release of Amarok 1.4.4 Iwill unsubscribe from every mailing list, not aggregate planets or blogs or IT related news, not join any IRC channel, not log into my jabber account @ kdetalk, not answer any mail about Amarok, KDE or FOSS (as long as it's not really important to do so) and probably some more Ididn't think of as Ialso stopped drinking coffee (doctor's advice). Now, why do Ido this? Mainly because Ihave far too much responsibilities right now (not only in FOSS), and this is putting a lot of pressure on me, but also because Iwant to get an all new view at the whole open source movement, and last but not least, because Iwant to spend more time on learning French So, watch out for Amarok 1.4.4 Posted by Harald Sitter in apachelogger at 14:32 | Comments (4) | Trackbacks (0) <rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#\"\n                 xmlns:trackback=\"http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/\"\n                 xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\">\n        <rdf:Description\n                 rdf:about=\"http://amarok.kde.org/blog/feeds/ei_273.rdf\"\n                 trackback:ping=\"http://amarok.kde.org/blog/comment.php?type=trackback&amp;entry_id=273\"\n                 dc:title=\"Timeoutlogger\"\n                 dc:identifier=\"http://amarok.kde.org/blog/archives/273-Timeoutlogger.html\" />\n        </rdf:RDF>"

If you still have no idea how Ilook like: <-- the Kayed one.  So, Ihope someone will guide me to aKademy location and ensures that Idon't tumble in a big hole (->O<-) gotta pray a bit now (getting the plane is already quite difficult).  Anyway, finally Ijust want to thank my school for making it possible to travel on Firday and Monday,  so that Ican at least enjoy the weekend of this year's KDE Conference. (BTW: there will be no Amarok release, live from aKademy - 1.4.3 was just too ASAP and .4 is not finished - maybe a special aKademy snapshot, though Iwonder about the sense...)

As we can see here, MS Windows wants to welcome everybody with a well known look, which just reminds on home. In fact, this is a research done by the government, to find out whether it is possible to control the amount of visitors with such welcome messages. Ican tell you, since they started to welcome visitors like this, the amount of visitors got unhalved. Now, I, as an  free desktop enthusiast, think we should prepare for the worst when entering the plain/train to Dublin. So, don't forget your Kubuntu CD's , your Kay-Shirts and last but not least the Kay's .
