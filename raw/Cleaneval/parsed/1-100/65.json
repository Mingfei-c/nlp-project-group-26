      "text": "Linux Security: It's Not Just About Security by Jon Lasser , in Editorials - Sat, Jan 8th 2000 23:59  PDT Jon Lasser began the Bastille Linux Project in order to harden the\r\nsecurity of Red Hat Linux, the distribution he uses at work.  In the\r\nprocess, he began looking at the other distributions to see how they\r\nhandle security updates, and he was not at all happy with what he\r\nfound.  In today's editorial, he shares his concerns and explains why\r\nit matters to you even if you do all your security monitoring for\r\nyourself. Copyright notice: All reader-contributed material on freshmeat.net \r\n          is the property and responsibility of its author; for reprint rights, please contact the author\r\n          directly. As a professional Unix systems administrator, I'm concerned about\r\nsystem security. Keeping unauthorized users off my systems is simply\r\npart of my job; doing this requires vigilance in the form of\r\nmonitoring performance, reading logs, and keeping patches up-to-date.\r\nFor me, security is about security; it's about keeping my users'\r\nprojects safe and keeping them comfortable despite a full-time\r\nconnection to the Internet. As Lead Coordinator of the\r\nBastille Linux Project , a hardening script for Red Hat Linux, Ithought my job was to make Linux more secure so beginning users could\r\neasily keep their boxes secure. Often, new Linux users have no\r\nexperience as system administrators or often even any experience with\r\nUnix. Ithought the best way to tackle the problem was to make it easy\r\nto do the right thing. Recently, I've been asked lots of questions about Linux system\r\nsecurity by reporters. Often, I'm put on the defensive right away: Does\r\nLinux have a security problem? Why is Linux less secure than other\r\noperating systems? Is open-source software inherently less secure than\r\ncommercial systems? Iusually begin by explaining that more holes are reported in\r\nopen-source software before they're exploited, and that the\r\nnumber of actually-exploited holes is no greater -- perhaps even less --\r\nthan commercial software. Iexplain that one reason there are so many\r\nbreak-ins into Linux systems is that there are so many Linux systems on\r\nthe Internet, and Iexplain that Linux can be as secure as any other\r\noperating system. But Linux does have a security problem. It's not a universal problem,\r\nbut look at the following list of security Web sites, mailing lists, and\r\nupdate tools for some common Linux distributions: Red Hat Linux http://www.redhat.com/support/errata redhat-watch-list-request@redhat.com Update Agent available only to purchasers of Red Hat 6.1 Debian http://www.debian.org/security debian-security-announce-REQUEST@lists.debian.org apt-get update SuSE http://www.suse.de/security suse-security-announce-subscribe@suse.com No official tool for auto updates  -- AutoRPM works on both\r\nSuSE and Red Hat. Mandrake http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/security.php3 symp@linux-mandrake.com MandrakeUpdate Caldera http://www.calderasystems.com/support/security announce-subscribe@lists.caldera.com is not just security\r\nupdates but also product announcements, press releases, etc. No official tool for automatic updates Corel No known web page for security No known mail list for security No known tool for security updates. 'apt-get update'\r\nprobably works, as it's based on Debian Linux Turbo Linux No known web page for security No known mail list for security No known tool for security updates Slackware Linux No known web page for security No known mail list for security No known tool for security updates These are all mainstream Linux distributions, tending towards a\r\ngeneral audience; at the least, they're not aiming at the router market\r\nor the embedded devices market. These are all products intended to be\r\nused by normal people and thrown up on a corporate network or even\r\nthe Internet. Some may be aimed at relatively expert users, but I'm\r\na fairly advanced user myself, and Istill expect that my software\r\ndistributor is watching out for security at least minimally. That's\r\none of the reasons Idon't roll my own distribution. Of the eight common distributions Icould think of, three have\r\nnothing whatsoever to do with security, and at least one of the\r\nothers didn't seem to be doing anything useful. No wonder Linux has a\r\nsecurity problem: while those four distributions have probably less\r\nthan a quarter of the Linux market, they tend to be high-profile\r\ndistributions which garner more than their share of media coverage. These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they're\r\ndamaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Every\r\ntime I'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, Ihave to\r\nconsider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before Ican answer.\r\nThese distributions' total lack of concern with security is an\r\nembarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities. Because of these distributions, I'm forced to admit to reporters\r\nthat many Linux installations are insecure, and there's little the\r\naverage user can do about it without dedicating an inordinate amount of\r\ntime to security work. Most users aren't paid to worry about security,\r\nas Iam. For many, computing may be only a small part of their work.\r\nThese people can't rightly be asked to read Bugtraq; they've got work to\r\ndo. If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems\r\nwouldn't be cracked. On the university campus where Iwork, systems have\r\nbeen exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than a year\r\nold, and which has been patched nearly that long. Being a professional,\r\nIknow that they shouldn't even be running it, because Iknow that\r\nthey're not using it. But Ican't expect them to know, and Ican't even\r\nfix it myself: Ididn't know that some of these machines existed\r\nuntil Ifound out that they'd been hacked. Asking these users to read a\r\nsingle, low-volume, vendor-specific mailing list is a pretty good\r\nsolution -- when those lists exist. Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don't\r\nprovide security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to a\r\nWeb site, a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these\r\ndistributions not because they necessarily need the security notices\r\nfor themselves, but because these distributions are ruining Linux's\r\nimage not only with novice users, but with the reporters and editors who\r\nshape managers' opinions on whether Linux is a viable solution. You may claim that you're a hobbyist, and you couldn't care less if\r\nbusinesses use Linux; that's your right, certainly. However, you lose\r\nnothing when businesses use Linux, you lose nothing when security\r\nupdates are made available and publicized, and you gain nothing when\r\nbusinesses reject Linux because some vendor couldn't be bothered to\r\npackage up an already publicly-available solution to a security\r\nhole. The rest of us do lose.  It hurts our professional reputations when\r\nwe stand behind a piece of software with frequent and\r\nhighly-publicized security lapses.  It wastes our time, tracking down\r\nhacked user machines for which we're not responsible and rebuilding\r\nthem from the ground up.  It wastes our money, when businesses and\r\ngovernment agencies buy more expensive hardware and software for the\r\nillusion of security. Solving this problem isn't difficult or time consuming; simply pick\r\ndistributions which express a basic level of concern for security\r\nissues, and let vendors know -- at trade shows, in e-mail, in letters\r\nto the editor of your favorite publication -- that security isn't just\r\nabout security.  It's about preserving our reputation for quality, and\r\nit's about saving time and money.

CEOs will not ever\nlearn\r\n   much, if anything, about how computers work. For them it's a tool, not\na hobby. It's much more cost effective to have an expert configure their\r\n   computer than it is for them to do it themselves. Ok, then, let me take the car analogy one step further that that ... Windows Vehicle: You turn on your machine, it boots Windows, you hit the Start button,\nyou chose a program, it runs.  If there's a problem, an \"engine problem\"\nindicator lights up on the dashboard. You get in your Geo, put the key in the ignition, turn it on, put the\ngearshift in Drive, step on the gas, and go.  If there's a problem, a\n\"General Fault\" message pops up on the screen. Linux Vehicle: You turn on your machine, it boots Linux/BSD/Solaris/FooNIX, you watch\nthe startup messages for any errors, you type in your login and password,\nyou get a shell prompt, maybe you type \"startx\" to get a nice GUI.  You\nnow have your choice of hudreds of commands, tools, utilities, compilers,\neditors, and apps to bring to bear on the problem at hand.  If there's a\nproblem, a core file and a ton of log messages are spewed out to tell the\nuser exactly what part broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise\nthe stability of the rest of the system. You step out on the flight line, do a thorough walkaround of your F-22\nchecking for any potential problems, hop in the cockpit, enter your\nauthentication code, crank up the turbines, taxi out to the end of the\nrunway, get clearance from the tower, and take off.  You now have your\nchoice of hundreds of possible maneuvers, and a wide array of avionics,\nECM, and weaponry to bring to bear on the problem at hand.  If there's a\nproblem, diagnostic information gets spewed out at the pilot to tell him\nexactly what part broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise the\nairworthiness of the aircraft. The driver of the Geo doesn't need to know how the engine works, or how to\nrepair it, in order to get from point Ato poing B.  That's what the\nmechanic is for.  If there's a problem, an \"engine problem\" indicator\nlights up on the dashboard. Likewise, the driver of the F-22 doesn't need to know how the radar,\navionics, and engine work, or how to repair them, in order to shoot down\nthe other guy.  That's what the ground crew is for. The persond driving F-22, however, must have a great deal more knowledge\nof and competence in the physics involved in maneuvering the vehicle than\nthe driver of the Geo. The \"driver\" of the Windows box doesn't need to know how files are stored\non disk, or how an interrupt vector tells the CPU that the sound card\nwants some attention.  He does need to know enough to use the Start->Shut\nDown menu item, instead of just turning off the power.  He should know enough not to run any .exe files or open any word files that haven't\nbeen virus scanned. The \"driver\" of the Linux box doesn't need to know what an inode is, or\nhow System V IPC works.  He does need to know how to log on and off\nproperly, and how to read basic error messages that show up on the\nconsole, how to use the shutdown command. He should know the basics\nof configuring and compiling a kernel, and locking down inetd.conf and the\nrc.* files. In a corporate environment, most of the more complicated stuff for either\nsystem is handled by the IT staff.  They take care of things like\nfirewalls at the edge of the corporate network, and shutting off telnet,\nftp, rpc, and other such things on machines that don't need them up. At home, it's a different story.  Someone using a computer at home is most\nlikely either dialing a modem in to an ISP, or connecting full time with an\nISDN or DSL link. (Unless they're a total geek, and have set up their own\n10.0.0.0 network behind a dedicated NAT-ing/Firewalling box ...) Sadly, most people don't realize the risk they're putting themselves at by\ndoing this without installing and configuring security tools.  Even a\nsimple thing like NukeNabber for Windows can help avert a system\ncompromise, if the user is aware enough to yank the phone line out of the\nwall when a port scan is detected by it.  Ihave little sympathy for\npeople who's machines get compromised due to their own ignorance and\nincompetence. Anyone running a computer that's attatched to the\n'net needs to take the time to learn how to secure it. (By \"running\" Imean being the person responsible for it's maintenance, as in an IT person\nfor a corporation, or the owner/user of a home machine.) That's just the way it is. If you want Linux for the masses, it must\nbe idiot proof. There's no such thing. If no distro makes the idiot proof LAN workstation, then each network\r\n   sys admin will have to cook up their own. Who's better qualified to cook up a machine config that's suited to the\nlocal network environment that the local network admin?"

Ithink some\nof these slackeware types need to starting dealing with their anger... Well, some of the statements made in the original article (and many of the\nresponses) were just bound to start a religious flame war.  Welcome to the\nwonderful world of Linux geeks ... Ihave to disagree with RichD's premise that every UNIX user must be\nresponsible for understanding UNIX security. My premise isn't even that every UNIX user should be responsible for\nunderstanding UNIX security.  My premise is that every computer user should be responsible for understanding basic computer security.  The state of the general public's computer literacy is,\nIMNERHO, simply pathetic! How many people simply assume it's safe to go into Windows and start up\ntheir Dialup Networking and connect to the Internet?  How many people\nassume that because they use an ISP and have a dynamically assigned IP\naddress that they can't get hacked?  How many people assume it's ok to\nopen that Word file without virus scanning it because they \"know\" that\nonly .exe files can contain viruses?  How many people assume it's safe to\nget up from their workstation without locking their screen? From my point of view, that's just like driving off in a car not knowing\nwhere the brake pedal is, and assuming you're not going to crash into\nanything.  It's just like turning on a band saw and shoving a piece of\nwood in the general direction of the blades without wearing safety glasses\nor knowing where the scram switch is, and assuming you won't get a splinter\nin your eye or cut your fingers off. Acomputer is a powerful, complex tool that, if properly applied, can\nboost productivity in the workplace to a great degree.  Like any other\ntool, however, if it is not used correctly, it has the potential to do a\ngreat deal of damage. Linux advocates talk about displacing Windows, but it will never happen\nuntil secrataries and CEOs can be productive on Linux, too. The tools are there, it's just a matter of R-ing TFM to learn how to use\nthem. And believe me, they barely understand what their account name is. True.  And there's no excuse for that level of incompetence in someone\nwho's educated enough to be a CEO. One person must be able to maintain 10's or 100's of \"secure enough\"\nLinux boxes. One person, who has even just a little experience installing and securing\nLinux boxes, can.  It would make a great internship opportunity for a CS\nstudent looking at getting into network administration ... You don't have to have a PhD in Computer Science to be able to use a\ncomputer safely and effectively, just as you don't need to know the\nphysics and engineering of an internal combustion engine to drive a car\nsafely and effectively -- but, as with a car or a bandsaw or any other\npiece of equipment, a basic level of knowledge and competence is\nneeded.  It is this lack of knowledge of the fundamentals of networks and\ntheir hazards that causes so many machines to get cracked. With regards to distro install scripts, one thing Ifind annoying is\nthat the scripts (the one's I've used, at least) only run at install time.\nIthink a better\r\n   way to do it would be to have an install script that detected the\nhardware, installed the kernel and other non-optional packages, then\nrebooted into\r\n   console mode. Then, use a general purpose tool (one that you could run\nagain later) to enable and disable services, and install/uninstall\nsoftware. Umm ... let's see ... rpm for RedHat, pkgtool for Slackware, Debian has a\npackage manager, FreeBSD has pkg_add pkg_delete and the ports system,\nlinuxconf lets you adjust all your system settings from an easy to use and\nunderstand GUI (in X) or menu system (on the console) ... what are you\ncomplaining about? Most distributions even let you select between a Workstation and a Server\ninstallation, and adjust what daemons are available by default\naccordingly.  Perhaps they are a bit permissive with things like telnet,\nftp, nfs, and other services, but that's only in accordance with the UNIX\ntradition, where these services are expected to be available.  If you have\na problem with that, there's always OpenBSD, which shuts everything except\nSSH off by default. Above and beyond that issue, and I'll make this point again and again\nuntil it's heard, it's not that hard to go and get yourself\ninformed enough about your computer and OS to not make a total ass of\nyourself on the network! [reply] [top] [ » ] Corporate LANs and distro install scripts by Andy Wiggin - Jan 11th 2000 13:11:39 First, I'm glad the discussion has risen from the gutter. Ithink some of\nthese slackeware types need to starting dealing with their anger... Ihave to disagree with RichD's premise that every UNIX user must be\nresponsible for understanding UNIX security. I'm a newer Linux user (less\nthan two years), so Idon't have the same perspective as the old-timers. Idon't see Linux as a hobbyist's toy, Isee it as a tool that I'd like to be\nable to use at work (much as Mr. Lasser was talking about). In a LAN\nsetting, not everyone is a sysadmin, and in fact, that could never work.\nPeople can be perfectly productive UNIX users without understanding\nanything about inetd.conf. Iknow Iwas for years. For Linux to make it in the corporate world, the boxes need to be easy\nto set up as LAN workstations and easy to keep up to date with software\npatches. One person must be able to maintain 10's or 100's of \"secure\nenough\" Linux boxes. In my mind that should be the goal, and tools like\nAutoRPM and Bastille Linux are the right approach. Linux advocates talk about displacing Windows, but it will never\nhappen until secrataries and CEOs can be productive on Linux, too. And\nbelieve me, they barely understand what their account name is. With regards to distro install scripts, one thing Ifind annoying is\nthat the scripts (the one's I've used, at least) only run at install time.\nIthink a better way to do it would be to have an install script that\ndetected the hardware, installed the kernel and other non-optional\npackages, then rebooted into console mode. Then, use a general purpose\ntool (one that you could run again later) to enable and disable services,\nand install/uninstall software. That way turning on and off services would\nnot be such a big deal, since they could easily tweeked later using the\nsame, easy to use, vendor specific tool. This might make it more practicle\nto turn off more services by default. -Andy [reply] [top] [ » ] Security? distro independant. by digitalunity - Jan 11th 2000 02:44:20 Ifind fault not with Slackware, or Red Hat's policy on custom packages\nbeing included. My issue only is with the install programs from the\ndistros. Alinux install with all of the services turned off is fairly\nsecure. This is not entirely practical. Anyone intending to use their computer as a server should make it their\nresponsibility to keep themselves informed and their server running only\nnew software. Ifind it a little humorous when someone sets up a web\nserver, and maybe an ftp server, and a portscan reveals 20 open ports.\nThats insecure. And that is about right for any default install of most\ndistributions. Ihave always used slackware and yes, Ifelt it was in a\nbeta-stage until v7.0. My message is only that multiple inetd.conf files should be included with\nevery distribution, and the user should have the opportunity to choose\nfrom several options: Secure: for single users - no open ports Medium: for remote-admin nodes - telnet, ssh, just the 'portant stuff Insecure: for the hacker who will do it all themself anyways :) Ifind it discontenting that distributions include soooo many services on\nby default... but thats just me... and I'm just the user digitalunity aka digitalun aka mike the hacker next door bud - bag, can, bottle, keg. itsallgood. [reply] [top] [ » ] Out of the box secure distro?  One word ... by RichD - Jan 10th 2000 17:11:39 OpenBSD.  By default, remote access services are disabled until the admin\nexplicitly goes into inetd.conf and enables them. Slimy is correct in saying that Imiss the point of the main article in my\nprevious post.  Iwasn't aiming for it.  Iintended the post in context\nwith the other replies talking about how there should be a distro that is\n\"secure\" out of the box.  (Iguess Imissed that by a hair, too ;) The simple truth remains that there just is no such thing.  The security\nof any system, no matter what OS it is running, is a function of the\ncluefulness of the admin.  Awell run Linux box will be more secure than a\npoorly run OpenBSD install.  Awell run NT server will be more secure that\na shoddily maintained Solaris 7 box. Of course, the only way to have a system that is completely secure from\nbeing hacked on the 'net, is not to have it on the 'net at all.  Then all\nyou have to deal with is the security of physical access to the machine\nitself ... we've all seen the draconian measures that Hollywood producers\ncan think of to try and do that, and Tom Cruise was still able to steal\ndata off of it in Mission Impossible ... [reply] [top] [ » ] Missing the point by slimy - Jan 10th 2000 14:49:17 While Iagree with RickD's comment (especially the first paragraph), Ibelieve it misses the main point of the article. Clearly, one must learn Unix if one expects to administer a Linux\nmachine.  And that includes home users.  But still, most Linux\nDistributions that Ihave run across, Slackware and Debian included, make\nassuptions about system installations that are not, from a security\nstandpoint, logical.   For example, installing a telnetd server by default\nis probably not a good idea.  Having it installed and configured to accept\nremote connections by default is horrific!  Yet this was the case when Iinstalled Debian 2.1.  Debian 2.2 (Potato) is a little smarter than this,\nbut thats not the official release (yet). As anyone who has delt with security issues for some time will tell\nyou: the best security policy you can adopt is \"that which is not\nexplicitly allowed is denied\".  More distributions need to take this into\naccount. If Iwant a telnet server, Iwill ask for it.  And when Iinstall it,\nIwould expect that: at best, it would not aceept connections from\nanywhere until Itold it otherwise; at worst, it would accept local\nconnections only, until Itold it otherwise.

UNIX was not originally intended\nfor the \"casual\" or \"home\" user ... they just didn't exist in 1969.

IMNERHO, this is a Good Thing.\n The plain, simple, ugly truth is that if you don't know what inetd.conf is\nfor, if you don't know where your startup scripts are and how to edit them,\nif you don't know how to set up your anonymous FTP server correctly, etc.\netc. etc. ... then *you* *should* *NOT* *be* *using* *UNIX*!!!!! The flip side of that is that anyone can easily obtain the\ndocumentation and learn how to do all of these things, as well as all the\nother tasks required to keep a UNIX system up and running properly.  This\nhas the effect (or at least the potential) of raising the computer\nliteracy level of the general public. Sadly, most people think of their computer the same way they think\nabout their television set, their microwave, and their car.  The way Isee\nit, computers are actually more akin to power tools -- if you don't read\nthe instructions and/or get proper training in their use, you're gonna get\nhurt. There are a few simple truths about the Internet as it stands today\nthat many, if not most, people overlook: 1- The Internet, like Downtown(tm), is *NOT* a safe place.  Anyone who\nattatches a computer or a network to the Internet is placing themselves at\nrisk.  There are malicious people out there who want to steal your\ninformation, just like there are malicious people out there who want to\nsteal your wallet.  There are Script Kiddies out there who want to deface\nyour website, just as there are Junior Gangbangers out there who want to\ntag your house/car/fence/wall/place of business. 2- You gotta cover your own ass.  Ultimately, your computer's safety\nis your responsibility, just like your personal safety is your own\nresponsibility.  Companies have sysadmins who get paid to keep the network\nsecure.  They also have security guards and alarm systems and such to keep\nthe physical premeses physically secured.  At home, you have locks on your\ndoors, and perhaps an alarm system, to help keep intruders out of your\nhome.  Isay \"help\" because the fact remains that if someone really wants\nto break into your house, they will, alarm system notwithstanding.  The\nsame is true for computers on the 'net.  If someone *really* wants to get\nin, they will.  There are, however measures that can be taken to make it\nmuch more difficult. Yes, there are people out there who are trying to help look out for\neverybody's safety, just like there are police patrolling the streets\nlooking out for everyones safety ... and they're about as effective.  The\nfact remains that if you don't know how to spot a potential mugger, and if\nyou don't bother learning basic personal safety practices (like scanning\nthe area for potential baddies before unlocking your car door or\napproaching your home, or being able to spot the scratches on the lock and\ndoor frame that indicate forced entry), you're much more likely to get\nmugged than the person who *has* bothered to learn these things. Similarly, if you don't bother learning basic computer safety\npractices (like editing inetd.conf, and configuring firewalling), you're\nmuch more likely to get cracked that the person who *has* learned these\nthings. It doesn't take much.  Anyone who has any semblance of intelligence\nhigher that that of an earthworm can figure out how to edit their\ninetd.conf file to turn off unecessary daemons.  Configuring IPChains is a\npiece of cake, if you bother to read the FAQ and HOWTO. Ihave no sympathy for anyone who whines about how hard it is to set\nup a Linux/BSD/UNIX system.  \"But Windows just works\" is the party line\n... primarily because most people never actually *do* a Windows install. \nThey buy computers from the local consumer electronics store, which come\nwith Windows preinstalled (by someone who gets paid to install Windows on\ndozens or hundreds of computers a day), and have no clue how insecure they\nare when they hit that Dialup Networking button to go surfing the net. At least Linux and the other freeware Unices *have* easily accessible\nmechanisms like inetd.conf, and firewalling tools like IPChains that allow\nthem to be made more secure.  At least the users of these systems know (or\nshould know) that there are security issues to be addressed. Most Windows users are blissfully unaware that they are wide open to\nmany attacks that can crash their machines, and many more attacks that\ntake advantage of their ignorance to use email attatchments, JavaScript,\nActiveX, and other such methods to install backdoors into their systems. \nFurthermore, most Windows users have no simple method to block such\nattacks against their home box that they use to dial directly into the\n'net. When these users load Linux, without taking the time to learn about\nthe issues involved, they remain just as ignorant of their security\nsituation as they were when they were running Windows. People take the time to attend self defense and \"street smarts\"\nseminars, and martial arts classes to learn how to protect themselves in\nthe Real World(tm).  They watch the news to find out if there is a serial\nrapist in town this week.  They lock their doors and windows at night, and\nturn on the alarm system to keep the burglers out. Is it really to much to expect people to take the time to learn the\nrelatively simple techniques (like editing out unneeded daemons from\ninetd.conf and their startup scripts, and configuring firewalling like\nIPChains) that will lock down their Linux box to keep the Script Kiddies\nout?

The sites and lists\nhave been pointed out enough in the comments.  The man has appologized so\nlets move on. This article was a good one.  Unfortunately most people missed the point. \nIdon't think it was intended to tell us what distribution to use, or who\nto boycott; rather, it was intended to tell us what we should do about\nsecurity, why we need it, etc.  The common quote from most web site\ndefacers is \"Security is a Myth\".  This is true for the most part, but if\nwe all look at security and pay attention to it rather than sloughing it\noff, it doesn't have to be a myth.

[reply] [top] [ » ] Let's get the facts straight by Olaf Kirch - Jan 10th 2000 12:08:03 Being the person at Caldera who's responsible for security issues, Ifelt\nnot just a little insulted by your claim that Caldera is one of the\ndistributions that doesn't to anything about security. You write, in trying to apologize for your unfair treatment of Slackware:\n``In the old days [...] Slackware had huge numbers of security holes.''\nThis sentence enforces my suspicion that your article is based much more\non dated stereotypes than real understading of what goes on in the Linux\nsecurity area. If you go back to some time around 95, Igrant you that Linux\r\ndistributions used to resemble leaky buckets more than a secure OS. This,\nand the fact that Linux was ignored both by CERT and (to a large degree)\nby bugtraq as well lead to the establishment of various Linux security\nresources--such as a the linux-security list. Since then, most Linux distributors, including Caldera, have started to\nput a lot more emphasis on security. There is even a certain\r\namount of information sharing and coordination concerning security issues\namong Linux distributors. Ihave personally audited most if not all setuid applications and a\r\nnumber of network servers shipped with OpenLinux. Linux as a\r\nwhole has profited from this. And we're not the only Linux vendor\r\ntrying to address security problems proactively. Working in the security area myself Ican on the other hand understand\nyour apparent frustration. Making an operating system more secure is an\nuphill battle you cannot win. Distributors make mistakes in integrating\nsoftware with their product (or they make choices you consider a mistake).\nProgrammers insist on putting the same bugs into their programs over and\nover again (do a grep strcpy over the pine sources one day). Many users\nexpect things to \"just work\" and don't take security serious until they\nget hacked. However don't blame distribution maintainers for a problem that has many\nmore facets--especially if your assignment of blame is based on sloppy\nresearch. On the overall scale, Linux security has improved a lot over the past few\nyears--and while Iagree that there's a long way to go, progress will\ndepend at least as much on creating more secure software in the first\nplace as on the vendors' timely delivery of patches.

[reply] [top] [ » ] Another Slack Flame? by KL Davis - Jan 9th 2000 09:42:16 Well... Iread this a few hours ago, but thought it best to hold any comments\nfor awhile -- Awhile has passed. First, Ido not blame Mr. Lasser for this article.  Having experience\nas an editor of a small, international law enforcement journal... Iknow\nthat the old adage \"Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger\" holds no water\nin the journalism business.  Mr. Covey... shame now, did we not learn at\nleast one thing from the cinema classic \"Real Genius\"?  \"Never forget to\ncheck your references!\"  (Ithink the kids still like it when I \"get down\"\nverbally). Mr Lasser, Inote that you have made an attempt, albeit feeble, but\nwhat appears to be an attempt non the less at saying you are sorry?  If\nthis was an apology... then I, as a card carrying Slacker, accept -- Thank\nyou. Now if Imay make a comment or two?  Ido not claim to know even a\nfraction of what you, MR. Lasser, know about computer security.  Ionly\nstarted *tinkering* with computers in 1984 --  The majority of my security\nexperience is more with MP5s than MD5.  But, as anyone who knows me (or has\nhad the misfortune of finding my web site) knows, Ihave made a real\ndedication towards network security. Iseem to have taken a different, Ilike to think more practical,\napproach to finding what flavor of Linux Iwould use for my firewall and\nsecure OS base.  Rather than which distro was the most popular and had the\nmost support, Ichose the one that (IMO) needed the least work: Slackware! \nBut that is not why Iam writing, Ihope to offer a simple explanation that\nseems too often missed -- Or, misunderstood.  Anyway, this is what Ihave\npicked up in the last couple of decades... The notion that anyone can completely protect something is silly...\nnoble, but silly.  There is no security panacea -- and look closely at\nthose who claim to have it, odds are there little wagons have the words\n\"snake oil\" freshly painted over  on the sides.  It is this sort of\nthinking that drives a company to spend $180,000.00 on a high-tech,\nlaminated steel door - mounted in hardened and reinforced concrete & steel\nframe and casement - featuring hinges and locksets made of solid\nunobtanium!  Then put that door between two windows made of genuine\nglass? This is the same rational that has System Administrators walking\naround touting their new mega buck, AI powered, Super-Cyber-Crypt-Keeper\nSoftware... while EVERY terminal (even the one that customers can use in\nthe lobby) has a functional floppy drive! (yes, Ihave seen this). Security (my definition) is a measure of time -- a double ended time\nline, separated in the middle by an event... a breach or loss (X).  One\nthe left side of that event is the time leading up to it, the time before\nit happens -- not if, rather when.  To the right of the event, is the time\nit will take to recover from the event -- to fully negate the loss. |-------------------------------(X)-----------| Security is any effort that moves the event (X) further to the right,\nin fact all effort should be to move the event as far as possible to the\nright -- in a perfect world, a security compromise is only a threat until\nit is discovered, after action and contingency plans are already tested\nand in place... negation is immediate. Sorry, Ihave rambled on for far too long now... Ido respect you and\nyour efforts with the Bastille project, thanks!  And BTW, there is one\nfool proof plan for securing something, used every day actually, the\nGovernment has printed several manuals on how to do it even! ... Total\nDestruction. KLD a.k.a Nanux [reply] [top] [ » ] a secure distribution by Phil Howard - Jan 9th 2000 04:15:04 Different distributions try to address different issues as seen by\ndifferent kinds of users, all with different experiences and different\ngoals.  The very fact we have so many distributions attest to the\ndiversity of the user base.  This is something that Linux distributions\n(and their BSD cousins) have over that commercial OS we've heard about. One size does NOT fit all.  It never did, and it never will.  What a\nhacker needs, or what a hobbyist needs, or what a web site needs, or what\na system administrator needs, or what an office manager needs, or what a\nsalesman needs ... all these things are different. Ican certainly says from experience as a system administrator that\nthe most secure systems are the result of a skilled administrator taking\nthe time to get all the necessary information (and keep up to date so you\nare a moving target) and apply all the necessary upgrades and\nconfigurations.  However, a system administrator is not going to be\nsetting up most machines anymore as Linux begins to bump out that other OS\nfrom the desktop.  Indeed, many server situations fall into that arena.  If\nIwere to set up and configure a Linux desktop for someone, there are a LOT\nof things I'd be doing to the system AFTER installing the distribution,\nwith security changes being in the lead position, and other things like\nmanageability being next (for example, cleanup scripts that ensure logs\ndon't fill up /var). There are a lot of things a distribution could do to make life HELL\nfor a system administrator, but making EVERYTHING be defaulted to turned\nOFF is not one of them.  I've used both Slackware and Redhat and Ihave to\ndo a lot to both (more to Redhat but still a significant amount to\nSlackware) to make them secure.  Idon't clean inetd.conf ... Ishut off\ninetd itself ... on many systems.  Every distribution should leave every\nservice that could listen on a port or pipe turned off, even lpd.  During\ninstall, and at any time later, there can be the option to enable specific\nservices.  But unless those actions are taken, the services should be\ninstalled in such a way they are not running until properly turned on. This would be to the best benefit of end users who have little or no\ntime to keep themselves security aware, and as a system administrator, I'd\nmuch rather have to go turn things on than have to turn them off.  It would\nnot break any distribution to do it this way. [reply] [top] [ » ] Oh my. by Daniel T. Chen - Jan 9th 2000 04:10:57 Jon Lasser brings up some very good points, and his editorial is\nwell-suited to the Linux community.  As one of several student Unix\nsysadmins in the computer science department, Ihave to deal with the same\ntypes of things he does.  One of the reasons we've opted not to go with\nLinux 100% but instead concentrated on IRIX and Solaris is because (1) we\nfeel IRIX has a proven track record of being more stable and secure than\nLinux; and (2) because Solaris provides a proven environment in which our\nCS students can code.  This does not prevent many attempts to exploit our\nmachines, however.  On the average, Ispend nearly twenty minutes *per\nhour* scrounging through logs and checking stats to ensure that my fellow\nstudents are safe at what they do best (coding).\r\n\r\nThis does not come at an easy price.  Since I'm only one of a few\nsecurity-minded student sysadmins, Ihave to make sure that my coworkers\nare kept current on the latest exploits, security advisories and fixes,\netc.\r\n\r\n[Imean this as no offense to anyone, but I've also noticed that the irc\nnetwork EFNet seems to split a lot more often now that Linux ircds have\npopped up.  Things weren't this way when they stuck to *BSD daemons. \n*sigh*]\r\n\r\nIsimply wish we could all just listen to what Jon Lasser was trying to\npoint out instead of nitpicking over the details of whether or not a\nparticular distribution has security lists/pages/whatnot.

It\r\ncertainly wasn't intended to be that.\" Simple Answer: \"These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they're\ndamaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace.

They should abandon these distributions not\nbecause they necessarily need the security notices for themselves, but\nbecause these distributions are ruining Linux's image not only with novice\nusers, but with the reporters and editors who shape managers' opinions on\nwhether Linux is a viable solution.\" [ Further Ifound this funny \"If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems wouldn't\nbe cracked.

Iam not going to say Slackware is the most secure Linux, but\nthat is only because Iagree with the comment about the administrators\nbeing the security. As far as getting a distribution secure in a short\namound of time, Slackware is darn good. Recently a RedHat loving (Once Slackware despising) friend of my'n was\namazed at how easy slackware is to configure ( without all the junk in the\nway ) and has since changed distributions. Slackware is quite offten\nsmashed and bashed. It seems mostly by people who either haven't used it,\nor NEED a GUI with pretty pictures to run a computer. You are in the position to influcence people. Obtaining an article on a\nmajor open source / linux site. It is your responsibility to at least know\nwhat products / projects you are telling people to \"abandon\". \"Icertainly hope (and to some degree expect) that this situation's been\ncleaned up by now, but this made it impossible to audit slackware's\nsecurity if you wanted to.\" Well why don't you try it out before the next\ntime you go publicly trashing it!

They could all use a front-end script or dialogue which would ask\nnew users what actually needs to be enabled, and then disable everything\nelse by default.  Iwould rather assume that users who need the services\nwill need to learn enough about the process to be able to enable them\nthemselves anyway. The author makes a good point that if newbie users start having\nsecurity problems all over the place because services they know nothing\nabout and could care less about are enabled by default, this could have a\ndetrimental impact on the Linux community in general with bad press if,\nfor example, many thousands of these unsuspecting users become mail relays\nand stop-over points. I've used a number of the major distributions, and to my knowledge\nthey are all guilty of this. They should come out of the box with all\nservices disabled by default. The users who need these services will do the necessary research (it\nis hoped) to be able to use them in the most secure way possible, and to\nkeep on top of security advisories etc.  But you can't expect everyone who\njust wants to use Linux for themselves to be on top of it all.

[reply] [top] [ » ] Read the message, not the words by Daniel Lawson - Jan 8th 2000 20:17:55 Ithink people are getting a little bit too inflamed over the mistakes\nconcerning slackware. The point being made was, a lot of people use linux that do NOT have\ntime to, or even understand how to, secure their systems. Its exactly the\nsame with other more mainstream OSs - Iknow of several ppl who claim to\nbe NT admins, and yet dont even know where the MS security websites are. Sure, when Iinstall a linux system Igo through and clean out inetd,\nadd a decent ipchains firewall if appicable, and upgrade all the packages\nthat Iknow have security flaws. Does Jane Bloggs who just installed a redhat 6.0 (or *any* system) to\nact as their companies dialup networking server and webserver know how to\ndo this? Would she know what cron *was*, much less that the redhat 6.0 rpm\nhappened to have a buffer overflow in it? (Ithink it was rh6.0 anyway) Would she know what the significance of inetd.conf is, much less how\nto secure it? My take on the original article was not a dig at any particular linux\ndistribution - but a point about the level of education out there. And,\nhand in hand with education, we have ease of accessability. Half an hour a day, or even 5 minutes a day, might be enough to cover\nthe headlines of bugtraq and a vendor-specific security mailing list, but\nsomeone telling Jane that she needed to upgrade her cron package because\nof a nasty buffer overflow which could give root access wont mean a thing\nunless 1) Jane knows if she uses the package 2) Jane knows if its relevant 3) Jane knows *how* to upgrade - be it installing a new rpm / deb, or\ngrabbing a source tarball, applying the relative patches, and compiling\nit Ithink there are a lot of people who use linux, because of the hype\nsurrouding it, who dont know what they are doing. In my opinion, workstation distributions *should* be more or less\nsecure by default - with the exception of unforseen things like buffer\noverruns in packages etc.  Why do you need to telnet into a workstation?\ndisable it by default. Why do you need ftp? pop3/imap? www? disable it. If\nthe user needs it, they can set it up themselves. They need to learn. Similar sort of tactics should be taken on a server distribution. Oh no, people will cry, that will make it too hard! No one will use\nlinux if its too hard! Education.... We dont need distributions that do everything for us - unless we\nrolled it ourselves, and know what it does. What we do need is information\non *how* to secure it. Ithought the Bastille project was a good idea (although i never\nactually used it). Things like this need to be fostered and encouraged. We currently have screeds of disjoint man pages, HOWTOs which dont\nagree with your distribution (most of the ones i've read appear to work\nwith slackware, and bear no relevance to redhat), and package-supplied\nreadmes that can also bear no resemblance to your distribution-patched\nbinaries. Imake a generalisation above, Iknow. But we need more distribution\nspecific information on how to do these things. And it needs to be centralised, and put in a 'to-do' list so that new\nusers can *find* it easily enough. Hmm. Icould have spent the time it took writing this, to instead\nwrite a redhat-specific HOWTO's on securing your workstation by locking\ndown inetd, and checking for recent rpm updates.

You mention \"no official tool for automatic update.\" By automatic do you mean... gets the patches and installs for you, you\nget the patches (some format. rpm, deb,slack tgz, whatever) and it auto\ninstalls? what? If you want a deamon to install patches for you over the\ninternet, you dont know the first thing about security. a: your computer desides its time to check for updates. b: Ihacked your local nameserver to point (whatever).(whatever) at my\nbox, and set up an package distrobution server for whatever client is used\nin whatever distro. you resolve to me and get a backdoored in.telnetd or\nwhatever. boom. your rooted. 2.   \"Slackware Linux \" a:   \"No known web page for security \" try: ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-7.0/patches/ There are all the patches. the Changelog.txt file tells you what they\nare and why you would need them. b:   \"No known mail list for security\" Maybe if you went to www.slackware.com and clicked the little \"mailing\nlists\" link you would see the slackware-security and slackware-anounce\nlists. even avalible in journal form! c:    \"No known tool for security updates\" There are several ways to do it. installpkg [pkgname] pkgtool here again \"Forgive them Father... they know not what they do...\" You tell people to abandon linux distros based on your lies.

Even your linux box in the corner of your office with a\nstatic ip, with just telnet and ftp services running, and all the latest\npatches you can think of put on it; is ALOT less secure then if you pull\nout the ethernet wire.  In this day and age there is no \"most secured\"\nlinux distrobution. There is always something else you can do to make it\njust a little more secure. All the linux distrobutions include programs written by not the people\nwho released the distrobution.  Which means in fact, that hundreds of\ndifferent programs, written by hundreds of different people are on the\nsame computer.  Thos will also mean that there is a very likely chance\nthat one or more of those programs will have security problems.  And Iam\nnot just talking about Linux, or just Unix in general.  Look at Windows 95\n98 and certan versions of NT: Hundreds of programmers work on them, from\none major company, and there was a mistake in codeing that caused remote\nusers to be able to disconnect them from the internet.  Something like\nthat could happen in the linux world also, a popularly used program that\nhas a tragic flaw. Personally though, as many other people have said, when first\ninstalling any distrobution they have to spend time fixing up inetd.conf\ndisableing services that arent needed.

Exploits used to come out for SunOS 4.x for precisely the same\nreason, but that didn't mean that Ultrix was more secure. (Point of fact,\nit probably wasn't, it was just less tested.) And the fact that Red Hat\nreleases security fixes fairly promptly means that it's possible to secure\nthe system in a pretty much up-to-date fashion. But that only answers half the question: so now Iknow why people take\nSlackware to be the target (because Imade a mistake which gave them a\nfoothold from which to attack me), but why do they think it's all about\nRed Hat?  On the basis of the article, it seems clear that  SuSE, Debian,\nand Mandrake are all probably more secure than Red Hat. The fact that I've\ngot a whole project just to secure Red Hat seems as much proof as any that\nit's not especially secure -- but the fact that they've got some security\nresources certainly means they're trying. (And Istarted Bastille not to secure RH for myself, but because there\nare dozens or hundreds of user-administered Red Hat boxes on the campus of\nthe university where Iwork. Ineed a way to secure those machines when Ihave no direct control over them -- which means Ineed to secure the OS\nthey're already running.)

[reply] [top] [ » ] Oops by Jon Lasser - Jan 8th 2000 14:01:16 Yep, Idid somehow manage to miss the Slackware security mailing list. Iswear Iwent to the site and looked around before claiming not to\nfind anything, but somehow Istill made a mistake. Ican't speak to the security or insecurity per se of Slackware 7, as\nI've not used it, but I'll note that most of the recent security holes in\nRed Hat and Debian (with the very notable exception of problems with Red\nHat's usermode tool -- a very, very serious problem) have been bugs in the\nunderlying code, not particularly related to either of those distributions.\nIf those bugs aren't present in Slackware, that's either because those\npackages weren't included in Slackware (not a bad thing, just a point of\nfact) or because Slackware fixed those bugs before anyone else knew about\nthem and failed to backpropogate the fixes. Idon't think it's the\nlatter. In the old days (pre 7.0, maybe another level back beyond that or so, Ican't remember the last version Iused), Slackware had huge numbers of security holes. They just ignored them. And the sources never\nseemed to be able to produce the binaries which were included -- sometimes\nit was obvious that the included sources were pre-slackware-patches, as the\ncompiler would spew errors. Icertainly hope (and to some degree expect)\nthat this situation's been cleaned up by now, but this made it impossible\nto audit slackware's security if you wanted to. But I'm really curious as to why everyone took this as an attack on\nSlackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that. Icertainly think that Slackware's record on security could stand\nimprovement -- I'm more impressed with a large number of found and fixed\nbugs than an apparent lack of them in a full-featured Linux distribution\n-- but as far as I'm concerned in the article, this isn't about any\nparticular distribution. What it is about is why security is important, even if you\npersonally can handle yourself. Claiming otherwise is kind of like\nclaiming that ISO9660 filesystem support in Linux isn't worth keeping in\nthe kernel simply because you personally don't use it: it's a fundamental,\nenabling feature of the environment for any number of users. It's also about the importance of Linux's image in the media, and\nsimple things we can do to improve that image. If you personally don't\ncare who besides yourself uses Linux, that's fine. But Ineed Linux to\nlook good in the media, so that Ican push for it in appropriate projects\nat work and elsewhere. Also, a good image for Linux in the media makes it\nmore attractive for companies (ie Creative Labs) to write open-source\ndrivers for hardware which is nice to play with. :-) [reply] [top] [ » ] Slackware security by Jihad - Jan 8th 2000 13:32:01 Is it just me or does this \"professional\" not know what hes talking about? \nIve been using linux since slack 3.2 and ive found that slack is the most\nsecure distro, with debian coming in second and redhat coming in somewhere\nnear dead last, being the hackers paradise of buffer overflows and 'enabled\nby default' services that it is.

Its like watching a Baptist convention talking about the\nevils of Catholics/Lutherans (and as about as worthwhile). Slackware 7.0 is a very big improvement over earlier versions out there.\nPatrick seems to be much more in tune with putting out things with the\n4.0/5.0/6.0 Betas than Ihave seen him do in years (since the 2.x days). Idont know the reasoning behind it, but once slackware.com came into\nexistance... the quality of the Slackware machines Idealt with seemed to\nincrease also. Idealt with too many people with hacked Slack95 boxes with\nexploits that had been around way too long. Going to the cdrom.com site\nusually had out of date info. Now Isee a central site and people find\nthings rapidly and cleanly. Iused to use slackware up until 1996 when Iswitched to Red Hat because Iwas tired of finding exploits and the Slackware response was \"Well patch it\nand compile it for yourself. We will put out a fix next release\"... which\nnever came. When Ifound them in Red Hat, Isaw an RPM at a central spot. Now is Red Hat perfect? NO . There are bugs and it could\nalways tighten things up here or there. However Iknow every time a change\nis made to tighten security up... there are howls of \"Why did you change\nthis/that.\" The same is true for SuSE, Caldera, etc. You get slammed no\nmatter what you do because a) people hate change, and b) people like to\nwhine versus deal. Anyway back to the main point.. which is what is the problem. The problem\nis that Linux is not for System Administrators anymore !GASP! . Sorry most of the people who are using Linux\nprobably know only enough system administration to start a modem and stop\na modem... and that may be a stretch.  And that is what you get for having\nan open community and saying things like \"Stop using Microsoft... use\nsomething better... also we are a community versus an elitist club like\nXYZbsd, etc.\" (Not saying BSD is elitist, just a very common argument Ihear about why Linux is better). Most people use computers as an ends to a means as JWZ said. They use them\nto browse web sites, answer email, write documents and letters, scan\npictures in for a family album. The computer to them is nothing more than\na tool.. as much as the car gets them to and from work. With this being the case, and being that we are supposed to be a better OS\nand a better community... we need to make sure that we have a better\nattitude towards security.

Heaven forbid someone\nshould take the better route and leave everything off to begin with (like\nOpenBSD) and then let the system admininstrator turn on only the services\nhe needs.

Your article is interesting, but Ihave the impression you only tell\nobviousness : Yes, of course, users concern by security have to look for\ntools (mailing list web page, etc ...) that give distributions before\nmaking a choice. It's obvious ! But let's consider an another fact, security is not a goal for\neverybody, even if Ithink it's a bit dangerous. You simply want to be\ndictator, choosing for everybody the good way...

I'm a bit curious, what is your model of security OS ? Windows ? So\nyou never had a look on securityfocus (and others). Ican't see how we can have security actually without spend time for\nit.

You are missing the real enemy\nand misunderstanding the open software. [reply] [top] [ » ] a couple of points by Nicko Acks - Jan 8th 2000 07:57:56 The bigest problem that Ihave found with linux distributions is the same problem that Ihave faced with many commercial unix's: they have too many services turned on by default that are not needed. One of the bigest things that would be a help for security is that distributions go to a policy where installed software is only turned on when explicitly asked for rather than on by default.  While this will not  stop everything, it would stop a good portion of the new machines out there getting broken into right away. One thing comes to mind.  Why does every linux distribution need to be server oriented?  Ithink there is a real need out there for a completely client-side distribution.  This would take care of the extra services problem by making sure that servers are not even an option. Another issue that Ithink distributions should look into is finding a way to more easily distribute patches.   While it is a good thing that to have fixes come out quickly it is entire different problem with getting users to actually apply them.   Ithink the process of fixing bugs needs to be as simple as possible so that it can be as automated as possible (debian's app-get method for updating software comes to mind).   While this introduces even more possible security risks Ithink that it should be concidered at least for the new user. deffinitly a good editorial Jon...

[reply] [top] [ » ] Slackware doesn't take half an hour per day to patch by Bert Lindner - Jan 8th 2000 06:55:24 Slackware security mailing list info can be found at www.slackware.com/lists ,\nbrought to you by David Cantrell. This has been in place since October at\nleast. You can find all security patches by ftp on ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/linux/slackware-7.0/patches/ (for Slack 7 of course, for Slack 4 you'd find them here ). A Changelog in that directory tells you the when, why and do-i-need-them about these\npatches. That the author didn't look up the distro's before saying something\nabout them may be a trivial mistake, and Ihate to go against jwz for\nanything, but it does matter for Slackware users and potential Slackware\nusers if Slackware security is declared sloppy.

But for the\nvast majority of people, asking them to spend half an hour a day just looking for security fixes is completely unreasonable.  If it takes\nhalf an hour a day of every user's time to keep their system secure, then\nthere is something fundamentally wrong.  That's a huge amount of\ntime. Try to put yourself in the shoes of someone for whom messing with\ntheir computer is a means to an end, rather than an end in itself.  They\njust won't do it.  They have more important things to do.  Things that pay\nthe bills."

[reply] [top] [ » ] no slackware security list? by casphar - Jan 8th 2000 05:45:19 I'm a home and work user of Linux, my flavour of choice is Slackware. I've\nused most of the major distributions and am forced\r\nto use a few at work. As far as Slackware goes, it does have a security\nmailing list which i am subscribed to, it can easily be found at\nwww.slackware.com\r\nwhich also tells you that all of the current and future versions dir trees\nwill have a patch dir, with patches for that particular version.\r\nIalso sit on a 24/7 internet connection, with a static ip, i get at least\n1 hack attempt a day. And strangely enough none of them seem to have\nworked. Why? Because i spend half an hour a day checking new email for\nproblems,\r\nand checking websites for problems with anything i'm running. So if this\nprofessional sys admin has misinformed you of the slackware side of\nlinux,\r\nwhat else could he be wrong about? Icould be interpreting him wrong, or i\nmight just not be thinking clearly tonight, but i dont and never have had\nproblems\r\nwith the slackware distributions. [reply] [top] End of content"
