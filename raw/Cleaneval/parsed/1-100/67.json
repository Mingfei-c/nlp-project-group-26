      "text": "Counseling Philosophy As a sex expert (Ph.D. \n                                  in Human Sexuality, M.P.H. in Human Sexuality), \n                                  an author (\"Different Loving\",\"Come Hither\", \n                                  others), a sex-and-relationships expert (Cosmo, \n                                  Maxim, GQ, Redbook, dozens of others), Ihave \n                                  accumulated thousands of insights into what \n                                  makes people tick sexually.  I've worked with hundreds of individuals \n                                  on sex and relationships, first as a peer counselor \n                                  and, since 2000, as a licensed clinical sexologist (member, \n                                  American College of Sexologists). As a journalist \n                                  and author specializing in sex and relationships, \n                                  I've also fielded thousands of sex questions \n                                  over the years. From all that \n                                  I've learned, Ibelieve that personal happiness \n                                  cannot come until an individual is at peace \n                                  with his or her sexual identity. In my practice, \n                                  Ihelp clients to accept their own sexual truths \n                                  and teach them to make the best possible life \n                                  choices for themselves based on what they learn \n                                  about themselves. Whether you need help \n                                  building relationship skills, overcoming inhibitions, \n                                  dealing with a sexless marriage; are coping \n                                  with impotence, premature ejaculation, inability \n                                  to orgasm, obsessions/addictions, medical issues \n                                  or STDS; or have questions or concerns about gender issues, \n                                  BDSM, fetishism, bisexuality, swinging, or other unusual \n                                  sexual flavors, Iwill work with you to make \n                                  positive choices. Ipride myself in being different from other therapists in several ways.  Idon't think it's enough to be a good clinician:  without empathy and a personal investment in the client's success, therapy can drag on indefinitely without results.  My goal is to make myself unnecessary to clients - to help them get to a place where they don't need to speak to me every week to keep their lives in balance.   Iam an advocate \n                                  for my clients' personal goals. Ido not waste time and money on silence.  Ioffer advice, \n                                  insights, and share my own experiences when \n                                  relevant. Iview the therapy process as an opportunity \n                                  for a client to reveal him or herself completely \n                                  to someone who has both the skill and the commitment \n                                  to identify problem areas, ask the hard questions, \n                                  get to underlying truths, and to provide support \n                                  and comfort when clients feel vulnerable. My approach to human sexuality is enlightened, upbeat, and completely nonjudgmental.  Iblend therapeutic methodologies to tailor each course of therapy to the individual(s).   Iwork hard to help you help you forge tangible positive changes in your life and to heal from the past.  Iam incredibly proud of the progress that my clients make.  Nearly every client who has committed to a course of therapy with me has achieved\nthe goals they set and, more often, exceeded them.  Ilove \"graduating\" clients. My practice is restricted \n                                  to adults, age 18 and over. Couples of all varieties are welcome."
