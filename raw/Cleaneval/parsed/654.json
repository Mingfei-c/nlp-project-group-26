Blum (eblum@judge.com) Updated: February 16, 2006  Book Review: Sharpening Your SAS Skills by Sunil Gupta and Curt Edmonds Book Review: Sharpening Your SAS Skills by Sunil Gupta and Curt Edmonds Chapman & Hall/CRC Press: ISBN: 1584885017 This book is worth reading by all levels of SAS programmers but especially for the Beginner up to the\nIntermediate Levels. You should have some experience using the SAS software before picking up this\nbook. It provides concise explanations, helpful examples and a nice summary section at the end of all six\nchapters with the added benefit of some comprehensive questions with answers provided at the end of the\nbook. Another added feature of this book for those who have not used SAS V9 or V8, is a section on the\nenhancements to these two SAS versions which should be helpful to those who have not had much\nexperience with the new enhancements. In reading this book, Iuncovered a few new features of SAS that Iwas unaware of and immediately\nthought of where Icould utilize these new features and began employing them in my new code.\nThis book is NOT intended to be a reference manual but the 273 pages can easily be read over several\ndays and is helpful as a refresher course to reinforce your basic knowledge of SAS. It also provides a\ngreat presentation and explanation on the PDV which Ihave not found in other books by SAS users.\nThis is a book worth having in your SAS library to share with the rest of your staff who use the SAS\nSoftware.
