      "text": "—G. Morgan Watkins, Departmental Services Back in the spring of 1988, computer security was largely a matter of \"Make \r\n  sure you lock the computer room door when you're done.\" Then a few rogue \r\n  programs called \"viruses\" began to appear on the West Coast, spreading \r\n  and replicating undercover from one computer to another and reaching the University \r\n  several months later. First was the \"Pakistani Brain\" virus that struck \r\n  UT Windows computers late that summer. Then the \"Scores\" virus attacked \r\n  Macintoshes across campus, leaving many machines unusable for days. In these two cases, UT had time to prepare a defense because the Internet highway \r\n  was still largely under construction, and viruses spread mostly via shared diskettes. \r\n  But despite early warnings, UT was still hit hard when the outbreak took place: \r\n  significant service interruptions occurred, it wasn't easy to stop, there were \r\n  no virus protection packages, and people didn't take the threat seriously."

      "text": "Today, we have campus licenses for antivirus software, but we also have thousands \r\n  of computer viruses skulking worldwide. Unfortunately, people still don't take \r\n  the threat seriously enoughand the stakes are much higher. With millions of \r\n  business-critical computers linked to the Internet, a particularly malignant \r\n  virus could seriously damage the global economy in a single electronic blitzkrieg. The latest major attack came on May 5, when the \"Love Bug\" infected \r\n  Microsoft Outlook mail services and mailboxes across the world. Thousands of \r\n  infected e-mail messages were generated on campus, spreading a potential disaster \r\n  throughout the UT community. Although Asia and Europe had already been struck by the Love Bug during the \r\n  night, there were no official alerts to warn Americans. Even so, ACITS and many \r\n  departmental computer administrators reacted immediately. Within minutes, ACITS \r\n  personnel were phoning administrative and departmental contacts across campus, \r\n  letting them know of the attack. Since e-mail might be seen only after it was \r\n  too late, other staff posted signs in buildings and knocked on office doors. \r\n  Some departments shut down their servers; others isolated their local networks; \r\n  others braved out the attack but carefully reviewed their e-mail and refused \r\n  to open any attachments. Throughout the blitz, ACITS' central services remained \r\n  available while technical staff were busy stopping the influx of contaminated \r\n  attachments. The Help Desk was on hand to assist, and UT's home page posted \r\n  a prominent alert, directing people to useful information. Shortly after noon, \r\n  seminars were given on how to eradicate the Love Bug. A special team remained \r\n  on campus until late that night to help anyone who needed hands-on assistance. \r\n  Campus-wide recovery efforts went well. In part it was the skills of dedicated \r\n  staff across campus; in part it was luck. Fortunately, the Love Bug was rather innocuous, its destructive power mostly \r\n  limited to throwing away multimedia files and leaving droppings throughout system \r\n  folders. It did not trash hard disks, and it was relatively easy to recognize. \r\n  The Love Bug was not a terrorist act. But the next strike could well be."

      "text": "We hope that computer users are finally aware of how vulnerable their electronic \r\n  assets really are. In less than 24 hours, a poorly designed and simple piece \r\n  of code caused $20 billion in damages. We must assume that virus creators are \r\n  also aware of the destructive power now at their fingertips. To protect the \r\n  University, we need better communication, organization, and preparation. The \r\n  comments and suggestions below are directed to IT managers on campus. Even careful planning won't give perfect security against attacksthere will \r\n  always be holes in our defenses. The key to surviving an electronic incursion \r\n  is to expect it. This includes planning ahead, reacting quickly, notifying the \r\n  right people, finding solutions, and cleaning up the mess. Afterwards, a post-mortem \r\n  should be done to learn how to react better the next time. Generally, your most precious computer asset is your data, and anything you \r\n  can do before hand to protect it could save you later. Keep your computers' \r\n  operating systems and antivirus solutions up-to-date, and, above all, have reliable, \r\n  daily backups using expertly managed servers. Making users responsible for system \r\n  updates and backups is a poor solution. Keeping data on servers makes it easier \r\n  to retrieve data from backups."

      "text": "Know the location of all your departmental computing resources. If the department \r\n  has desktop management procedures, that is, specific hardware, operating systems, \r\n  and application suites that all members of a particular group use, it is much \r\n  easier to recover from a disaster. If user data is stored on file servers and \r\n  if standard system images are maintained, the road to normal operations is shorter. \r\n  And this is true whether the incident is a virus attack, a fire, flood, or theft. In the event of a security incident, such as a destructive virus, reaction \r\n  time is crucial. Before it happens, organize an Emergency Response Team (ERT). \r\n  You'll need an Incident Response Coordinator (IRC), a Communications Coordinator \r\n  (CC), and an Incident Technical Leader (ITL). Depending on the size of your \r\n  organization, you may need others to help make sure all the work gets done. \r\n  The IRC coordinates the actions of the team and takes responsibility for decisions. \r\n  The CC spreads the word and becomes the sole point of contact for the press. \r\n  The ITL gathers necessary technical information, puts together solutions, and \r\n  makes sure that the problem is cleaned up. Finally, members of the ERT must \r\n  be trained and must have materials to help them deal with unexpected problems."

      "text": "An ERT requires a communications plan. Who needs to be contacted if a virus \r\n  or other attack is detected? The plan should have names, phone numbers, and \r\n  the reason for calling each person or unit. There will be no time to work through \r\n  the telephone book trying to hunt down phone numbers. Be sure ACITS is on the \r\n  list. We can share information with departments and users and help assess the \r\n  extent of the damage. Also, a current paper inventory listing of hardware and \r\n  software assets, stored in a prearranged, secure location, could be essential \r\n  during a severe attack. An ERT checklist of steps to be taken and a set of forms to document work is \r\n  also essential. One or more members of an ERT might not be available when a \r\n  problem happens, and someone else may need to fill the role. Other items, such \r\n  as preprinted instructions and signs for hallways should also be created and \r\n  stored. Periodic disaster drills will keep the procedures fresh. An ERT is of \r\n  little use if its members cannot be found. Departments should have emergency \r\n  procedures posted in a central location to make it easy to find responsible \r\n  parties at any time. Even if someone has agreed to wear a pager, there should \r\n  be alternate contacts."

      "text": "Don't try to diagnose a security incident alone. Gather what information you \r\n  can, but check with the Help Desk and other support sites, as well as within \r\n  your college, to make sure you have all the facts. If the Internet is still \r\n  accessible, check the UT home page to see if anything has been posted. Other \r\n  excellent sites that track these kinds of problems include: The National Infrastructure Protection Center: www.nipc.gov The SANS Institute: www.sans.org The CERT Coordination Center: www.cert.org Also, check private vendors, such as Network Associates: www.nai.com Symantec: www.symantec.com Data Fellows: www.datafellows.com It may be prudent to disconnect an affected machine from the campus network, \r\n  but don't turn it off until you know what you're facing. Some viruses cause \r\n  further damage during the boot process. Obviously, be careful not to trigger \r\n  a virus on a system connected to the network or one that has useful information \r\n  on its hard drive. Some viruses can disrupt firmware severely enough to make \r\n  a system nearly unrecoverable. Moreover, avoid reading e-mail while logged in \r\n  with a privileged account on a workstation or server. Conceivably, you could \r\n  take down an entire facility by doing so. Finally, when you know what you've \r\n  found, share that information with ACITS so that a general alert can be sounded."

      "text": "Getting the word out to your user community can be a problem during a cyber \r\n  attack. Sometimes, sending information by e-mail is ill-advised, and telephone \r\n  contact allows for immediate interchange. If people can't be reached by phone, \r\n  knock on doors and post signs in hallways and on office doors. The key is to \r\n  use all communications paths, depending on the severity of the incident. If an attack is still underway, it may be prudent to disconnect your servers \r\n  from the network, and then to disconnect compromised systems. Keep track of \r\n  what machines have problems and mark them in some way so that others will know \r\n  the machine has not been properly restored. Paper signs taped over the monitor \r\n  screens are obvious indicators and will not fall off or be ignored. Affected \r\n  machines should not be used until they have been cleaned up."
