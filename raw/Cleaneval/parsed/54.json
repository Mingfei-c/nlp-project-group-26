      "text": "The year was 1931. Universal was a struggling Hollywood studio. Salvation\ncame from an unexpected place: the horror film. February saw the blockbuster\nrelease of Dracula , and only eight months later Frankenstein was released to become an even bigger hit. Inevitably this success\nled the studio to pursue a sequel, and in 1935 Universal released The Bride of Frankenstein , returning the director (James\nWhale) and most of the original cast. The film was a spectacular success\nat the box office. What the average 1935 movie-goer saw in the theater,\nthough, was a film heavily tweaked from the original script Whale\nhad been pursuing. Unlike its predecessor, The Bride of Frankenstein was exposed to the heavy hand of Joe Breen and the Production Code\nAdministration; a review of the shooting script and notes Breen wrote\nto the producers reveal forced alterations that change the nature\nof the film and its characters. When the original Frankenstein was released in 1931 the Production\nCode had not yet been put into enforcement. Censorship was yet the\ndominion of various local and state film boards. Though these groups\ncut various scenes from the screened prints of the original, there\nwas no federal censorship to deal with until the film's re-release\nin 1937 (Manguel 14). Bride of Frankenstein , however, had\nto deal with the Production Code Administration from the beginning.\nMany cases of censorship centered around the depiction of the female\nform and sexuality, but for the most part the issues raised in Bride\nof Frankenstein were ones of violence and religion. Breen, as a devout Catholic, was especially sensitive to unfavorable\nportrayals of religion in the movies. In this film Breen was especially\nworried by any scenes that would compare Frankenstein to God. Very\nearly on in the process he cautioned the studio against pursuing this\nobvious analogy. ``Throughout the script there are a number of\nreferences to Frankenstein ... which compare him to God and which\ncompare his creation of the monster to God's creation of man.'' Here\nBreen was blunt: ``All such references should be deleted'' (Gardner\n66). The subject matter was too tied to the comparison for such an\nultimatum to be completely followed, however, and a back-and-forth\non the topic went on throughout the production process. In one scene\nof the shooting script Frankenstein intensely monologues: ``I could\nhave bred a race and have found perhaps the secret of eternal life.\nAll that was in my brain -- my very grasp. I conceived it -- it was\nlike being God!'' (Riley B-7) Predictably, Joe Breen was not amused.\nHe suggested omitting the line, saying that it had in the past ``proven\nsomewhat blasphemous'' (Gardner 67). Whaler responded by offering\nto refer to ``being the Creator'' instead, but in the end the\noffered proved moot as the entire line was cut from the theatrical\nprint. Later in the sequence Dr. Pretorius was to derisively tell\nFrankenstein to ``follow the lead of Nature ... or of God -- if\nyou are fond of your fairy tales'' (Riley B-26). Breen wanted the\nline cut; Whaler instead changed ``fairy tales'' to ``Bible\nstories.'' Another religiously oriented cut provides a good example of the way\nin which Code-required cuts could alter the attitude of a scene. While\nrunning from a pursuing mob Frankenstein's monster happens into a\ncemetery. The script called for the monster to happen upon an ``imposing\nmonument'' depicting Christ on the cross (F-8). The monster, in a\nshow of compassion, tries to help the stricken figure, thinking it\nto be a human mistreated as he has been. The monster's effort ends\nup toppling the monument, revealing the crypt entrance below. Breen\nobjected to the scene, saying that Whaler ``should omit the figure\nof the statue of the Christ from this scene, substituting some other\ntype of monument'' (Gardner 67). Changing the monument, however,\nchanges how the audience views the monster's actions. Instead of attempting\nto be compassionate, the monster is instead shown lashing out at a\nrandom statue, toppling it in an act that is far more aggressive than\nthe original was to be. Though Breen meant only to prevent a conservative\npublic from finding offense in the scene, the effect of his action\nwas to force upon the monster an entirely different motivation. Aside from depictions of religion, Breen was primarily concerned with\nthe gruesomeness and violence the film promised. Even after primary\nshooting had ended Breen wrote to Universal warning them that the\nfilm would not get its seal as it then stood. ``This picture seems\nto us definitely to be a violation of our Production Code,'' he wrote\nthem, ``because of its excessive brutality and gruesomeness''\n(69). Scenes already filmed were targeted for removal. Early in the\nfilm a man and his wife are left standing by the burning wreckage\nof the mill as the crowd that watched the monster destroyed wanders\noff. The man moves closer, wanting his eyes to confirm for him that\nthe monster was truly dead. Instead the man falls into the water below\nand comes face-to-face with a monster very much alive. The man is\nkilled, and as the monster crawls up to the surface the wife is brought\nto a similar fate. The script gave a scene in which the drama between\nmonster and man unfolded slowly; Breen wanted the man's drowning to\ngo unshown. He also wanted deleted the shot of the monster pulling\nthe wife into the water. He won one and lost one, as Universal cut\nthe drowning scene but kept the image of the wife being tossed to\nher death. Later there is a scene where the monster kills a small\ngirl. This body is viewed by a group of ``little girls coming out\nof church in their white dresses'' and later carried through the\nstreets by the mother. The final print of the film still contained\nthe shot of the girls viewing the off-camera body, but cut the one\nthat would have shown the body itself (69). Breen was concerned not just with visuals that might upset the public,\nbut dialogue choices as well. The opening shots of the film originally\nincluded a scene where Mary Shelley says that she, her poet husband,\nand Lord Byron are ``all three infidels, scoffers at all marriage\nties, believing only in living fully and freely in whatever direction\nthe heart dictates'' (Riley A-5). The line, along with most of those\nmeant for these three, was cut completely from the theatrical print.\nElsewhere Breen got detailed enough to be squirmish about the word\n``entrails,'' getting it replaced with ``insides.'' (Gardner\n67-68). Breen also took objection to the idea of the monster as a\nsexual creature. Reviewing an early script he wrote that ``the\nmonster's use of the word ``mate'' should be dropped in this scene.\nAll material which suggests he desires a sexual companion is objectionable.\nWe suggest you substitute the word ``companion'''' (66). In the\nend the monster does refer to his soon-to-be-created partner as a\n``wife,'' though whether this implies more or less of a sexual\nconnotation than mate is debatable (Riley F-16). Only a few of the scenes censored in Bride of Frankenstein involved sexuality. In the scene where Dr. Pretorius shows Frankenstein\nhis created miniature creatures, one of the jars contains a tiny mermaid.\nBreen wrote that, ``The scene of the miniature mermaid should be\nhandled in such a way as to avoid any improper exposure'' (Gardner\n67). The shooting script made gave no guidance on what the mermaid\nshould look like, but the final release made sure the mermaid was\nwell-clothed. Cut entirely from the film were scenes in which Mary\nShelley was considered to be showing too much of her breasts. Breen's\nmemo after photography had finished tersely demanded that the studio\n``Delete all the ``breast shots'' in Reel 1'' (69). These\nshots went, and their late removal might have been part of the reason\nso much of the dialogue from these scenes was gutted. The ending of the film was also changed after primary shooting had\nended, though in this case changes were due more to Universal's concern\nthat the film have a happy ending than to any censorship concerns.\nWhere the shooting script has Frankenstein and Elizabeth dying alongside\nthe Doctor and their almost-human creations, the final theatrical\nprint does not. The principals were brought back to reshoot an ending\nin which the monster allows Frankenstein and Elizabeth to leave the\ntower before its destruction. However refilming the entire sequence\nwas too costly and in the final shot before the tower is destroyed\nFrankenstein is seen still inside, even though just previously he\nhad been shown to leave. In the end Breen gave Bride of Frankenstein a seal despite\nthe fact that it had not addressed all the objections he had raised.\nJust because the Production Code Administration signed off on the\nfilm did not mean the rest of the way was smooth sailing, though.\nBreen warned Universal to expect trouble with other censoring agencies:"

      "text": "Breen's warning proved to be absolutely correct. A few states did\nmake cuts to the film, but primarily trouble came when the production\nwas shown abroad. The film was gutted in several countries and banned\noutright in a few others. Despite its censorship troubles, Bride of Frankenstein was an enormous\nfiscal success. Audiences were able to look past the plot holes introduced\nby the many minutes of footage cut after filming and find a compelling\nhorror film. Today many of Breen's cuts look petty and the remaining\ncontent entirely tame, but to the audience of the time this was an\namazing film. The Production Code Administration greatly affected\nthe cinema of its time, and in Bride of Frankenstein you\ncan see how the required changes altered the tone and character of\nthe film.
