There exist sincere and\r\nintelligent people who believe there is strong evidence that Edward de\r\nVere, Seventeenth Earl of Oxford, was the author of these plays and poems.\r\nYet professional Shakespeare scholars -- those whose job it is to study,\r\nwrite, and teach about Shakespeare -- generally find Oxfordian\r\nclaims to be groundless, often not even worth discussing."

Oxfordians claim that these scholars are blinded to the\r\nevidence by a vested self-interest in preserving the authorship of \"the\r\nStratford Man,\" and some more extreme Oxfordians claim that there is an\r\nactive conspiracy among orthodox scholars to suppress pro-Oxford evidence\r\nand keep it from the attention of the general public.  The truth, however,\r\nis far more prosaic.  Oxfordians are not taken seriously by the\r\nShakespeare establishment because (with few exceptions) they do not follow\r\nbasic standards of scholarship, and the \"evidence\" they present for their\r\nfantastic scenarios is either distorted, taken out of context, or flat-out\r\nfalse. This web site is for the intelligent nonspecialist who doesn't know\r\nwhat to make of these challenges to Shakespeare's authorship.  Oxfordian\r\nbooks can be deceptively convincing to a reader who is unaware of the\r\nrelevant historical background and unused to the rhetorical tricks used by\r\nOxfordians.  Our aim is to provide context where needed, expose\r\nmisinformation passed off by Oxfordians as fact, and in general show the\r\nnonspecialist reader why professional Shakespeare scholars have so little\r\nregard for Oxfordian claims.  We know from experience that we are not\r\nlikely to convince any Oxfordians to change their views, but we hope that\r\nother readers will find something of value here.  We will be updating and\r\nadding new material as time permits, and we welcome any comments or\r\nsuggestions."

Their basis for thinking this is an engraving\r\nof the monument which appeared in William Dugdale's Antiquities of\r\nWarwickshire in 1656, and which depicts a monument significantly\r\ndifferent from what we see today; Charlton Ogburn writes in The\r\nMysterious William Shakespeare that \"there seems scant room for doubt\r\nthat the subject of the original sculpture was not a literary figure but a\r\ndealer in bagged commodities\" (p. 213).  However, the evidence is\r\noverwhelmingly against the Oxfordian scenario.  First, read M. H. \r\nSpielmann's detailed discussion of the\r\nmonument , and his demonstrations of the many errors and\r\ninconsistencies to be found in seventeenth-century engravings.  Then read David Kathman's discussion of 17th-century references to the monument, which\r\nshows that it was always seen as representing a famous poet and not a\r\ngrain dealer.

In Shakespeare, Oxford, and Verbal Parallels , David\r\nKathman examines Sobran's claim and finds it seriously defective,\r\nreflecting ignorance of both attribution studies and Elizabethan poetry."

Moreover, \r\ncontemporary writers never used \"invention\" to mean \"pseudonym\"; the word referred to the\r\nwriter's wit or imagination.  Far from suggesting the use of a pseudonym, Shakespeare's use of the phrase \"first heir of my\r\ninvention\" tells us that he wrote Venus and Adonis by himself and as himself."

Moreover, Benson nowhere expresses \r\nany doubt that the author of the poems was the William Shakespeare whose plays were collected \r\nin the First Folio and who died in April of 1616."

      "text": "The 1612 Funeral Elegy by W.S. has been in the news in recent\r\nyears, as scholars and other interested readers argued whether it had been written by\r\nWilliam Shakespeare; the current scholarly consensus is that the poem was\r\nprobably written by John Ford.  The case for Shakespeare's authorship was\r\nmade in Donald Foster's 1989 book Elegy by W.S. , and in subsequent\r\narticles by Foster, Richard Abrams, and others. Time and space do not\r\nallow us to present the arguments over the poem's authorship here but we\r\ncan provide the text of the Funeral Elegy itself.  There was spirited debate over the elegy's authorship on the\r\nelectronic Shakespeare conference SHAKSPER , and on the newsgroup humanities.lit.authors.Shakespeare .  Much of the new evidence which\r\nconvinced Foster that the Elegy was Shakespeare's comes from his lexical\r\ndatabase SHAXICON.  He wrote an article for\r\nthe Summer 1995 Shakespeare Newsletter , which, while it did not\r\nspecifically deal with the Elegy evidence, described the workings of\r\nSHAXICON in some detail.  Also, read David Kathman's 1996 post to the humanities.lit.authors.shakespeare\r\nnewsgroup, responding to early Oxfordian criticisms and clearing up some\r\ncommon misunderstandings about Foster's work on the Elegy, as well as a 2002 post on the matter. Anumber of\r\ncandidates were proposed as the real author of the Funeral Elegy ,\r\nincluding George Chapman, an unnamed member of \"a stable of elegy\r\nwriters\", a country parson, Simon Wastell, Sir William Strode, William\r\nSclater, and the 17th Earl\r\nof Oxford .  John Ford was first suggested in 1996 by Richard J.\r\nKennedy on Shaksper, but it was not until 2002 that the case for Ford\r\nwas generally considered to be stronger than the case for Shakespeare. The principal arguments in favor of John Ford's authorship may be found in Ward Elliott and Robert Valenza. \"Smoking Guns, Silver Bullets:\r\nCould John Ford Have Written the Funeral Elegy?\" Literary and Linguistic\r\nComputing 16:205-32 [2001]. Gilles D. Monsarrat \" A Funeral Elegy: Ford, W.S., and\r\nShakespeare\" in The Review of English Studies 53:186-203 [May\r\n2002].  Here is an\r\nabstract of Monsarrat's essay. Brian Vickers, Counterfeiting Shakespeare: Evidence, Authorship and\r\nJohn Ford's \"Funerall Elegye\" .  Here is the publisher's description of the book. After Monsarrat's essay appeared, Foster and Abrams conceded that\r\nthe case for Ford was now stronger than the case for Shakespeare. Ward E.Y. Elliott and Robert J. Valenza have put their own account of the\r\nmatter online: \"So Much\r\nHardball, So Little of it Over the Plate: Conclusions from our 'Debate'\r\nwith Donald Foster.\" For a series of skeptical responses to the attribution to Ford, see http://hometown.aol.com/kqknave/ The 1612 <i>Funeral Elegy</i> by W.S. has been in the news recently,\r\nbecause many scholars now believe that it was written by William Shakespeare.  If\r\nthis is so, then Oxford could not be Shakespeare, since he died in 1604.\r\nTime and space do not allow us to present the evidence for Shakespeare's\r\nauthorship here --- much of it can be found in Donald Foster's 1989 book\r\n<i>Elegy by W.S.</i>, and much more will be published later --- but we\r\ncan provide the text of the <a href=\"elegy.html\"><i>Funeral Elegy</i></a>.\r\nMuch of the new evidence which convinced Foster that the Elegy is Shakespeare's\r\ncomes from his lexical database SHAXICON.  He wrote an <a\r\nhref=\"shaxicon.html\">article</a> for the Summer 1995 <i>Shakespeare\r\nNewsletter</i>, which, while it does not specifically deal with the Elegy\r\nevidence, describes the workings of SHAXICON in some detail.

Francis Bacon The principal Baconian site is Shake-n-Bacon Another handsome Baconian site: Lawrence Gerald's Sir\r\nFrancis\r\nBacon's New Advancement of Learning Is Shakespeare\r\nDead? is a classic Baconian text by Mark Twain. Was Twain's book the product of plagiarism?

Aclassic response to Baconism is Andrew Lang's 1912 book, Shakespeare, Bacon and the Great Unknown . Penn Leary has written extensively on the Baconian ciphers he finds in\r\nShakespeare's works.   Leary died on March 9th, 2005 .

Wraight also\r\nbelieves in Marlowe. John Baker is responsible for the Marlowe/Shakespeare\r\nSchool of Thought Emporium . Jean\r\nJofen thinks that Marlowe was Jewish and that he also wrote the Martin\r\nMarprelate tracts when he wasn't writing the works of Shakespeare (she\r\nthinks Bacon and Oxford helped Marlowe be the bard). Carolyn\r\nGage has very personal reasons for supporting Marlowe Other Candidates John Raithel looks into the possibility that the works were penned by William Stanley, the sixth Earl of Derby Patrick Buckridge puts his money on Sir Edward Dyer . Would you believe the\r\nEarl of Rutland ? Ilya Gililov does, according to the Christian\r\nScience Monitor . Gililov's work has been reviewed (in Russian) by Anna\r\nBernikova and by Boris\r\nKuz'minsky Joanne Ambrose believes Shakespeare's works were written by Edmund Campion . Was Shakespeare Sicilian?  See Antonio \r\nCasa's news account of Martino Iuvara's notion (would it surpise anyone to learn that Iuvara himself is \r\nSicilian?).
