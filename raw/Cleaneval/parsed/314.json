      "text": "This is being written on March 30, 2001.  It is being\nupdated on April 5, 2001.  I apologize for the delay in getting this\nposted. (An additional one-word revision was made on May 14 to correct a\nsilly typo - nothing substantive.) The preliminary report may be found at http://www.icann.org/minutes/prelim-report-13mar01.htm . This was a public board meeting. When I left Santa Cruz, California to go to the Melbourne\nmeeting, there was no well-formed agenda.  For the most part the\nresolutions below were formulated by ICANN \"staff\" on the night before\nthe March 13 meeting.  Indeed the first time I saw the text of these\nresolutions was when they appeared on the computer monitors before me during the\nmeeting. The general sense of these resolutions was discussed in an\nalmost closed meeting of the Board on the evening of March 12.  I say\n\"almost closed\" because of the presence and active participation of at\nleast two people (other than ICANN's in-house counsel, who I believe is an\nappropriate person to invite to a board meeting) who are not members of the\nICANN board, one of whom is neither an ICANN officer nor even an ICANN\nemployee.  I do not feel that this is appropriate.  If these people want to act as ICANN board members, then it is\nmy feeling that they ought to stand for election.  Otherwise I feel that as\nlong as the public is excluded then these people ought to be excluded unless\nexplicitly invited for a limited purpose to provide information on a specific\nmatter. It is my feeling that since real discussion of matters occurred\nat this March 12 meeting, that such meeting ought to have been open to the\npublic or at least recorded so that the public could hear what what\ndiscussed.  I do not subscribe to the point of view that ICANN that board\nmembers require a cloak of secrecy except with respect to personnel matters,\nlitigation, or contract negotiations. I must say that I felt rushed.  I felt that\n\"staff\" had created a situation in\nwhich major policy matters were dumped in the Board's lap with inadequate time\nfor study of for review by the Board or the public.  One point that I do\nwant to make clear: I have no evidence or indication that this situation was the\nresult of any intent or purpose and I see no reason why anyone should entertain\nany theory that this situation was the result of any manipulative\nintention.  That does not mean, however, that we (ICANN) ought to not\nimprove procedures so that this situation does not frequently recur.  (We\nmust recognize that some matters will always be changing right up to the last\nminute and that sometimes everyone ought to simply accept the situation and give\nsuch leeway as is reasonable.) As an example of what happens when there is a rush - When the resolution on the report of the\nso-called Ad Hoc Group (on addressing) was presented it was not clearly\npointed out that the report was not approved by the full membership of the Ad\nHoc Group.  It was only later, in a chance meeting at an airport, that I found\nout that at least two members of that group - people whose technical judgment I trust -\nrefused to sign-off on the report. It is my belief that no resolution should be voted upon by the\nICANN board until the exact text of that resolution has been posted for at least\nseveral days. There is also a matter of completeness.  ICANN's web site is the primary vehicle by which\ninformation is made available to the public and to the board.  Yet that web\nsite is sometimes as impenetrable as the Minotaur's maze.  Consequently it is\nnow my belief that every resolution must contain usable references to all materials directly pertaining to that resolution. I felt that the ICANN board was engaging in several\nsignificant procedural failures, principally the failure to have adequate time\nfor public review and failure to properly delegate matters to the DNSO as\nrequired by the ICANN by-laws. My primary focus during the meetings in Melbourne was the\nAt-Large study.  I have significant reservations about that study,\nparticularly since it's committee was selected without any input from the\nat-large community and with the expressed intention to exclude anyone who has\nindicated that they consider the at-large to be an important and necessary part\nof ICANN.  I endeavored to find a way to enhance the committee membership\nbut found no way to do so that would have had even a prayer of being adopted by\nthe ICANN board. Although it was not a matter for vote, the proposed amendments\nto the VeriSign agreement did occupy a lot of discussion time.  Personally\nI was taken aback by the fait accompli \"take it or leave it\" package\nthat ICANN's \"staff\" presented to the Board.  Given the gravity\nof those amendments I considered the process to be an inversion of the proper\nrelationship between the should-be-master policy-making role of the Board and\nthe should-be subservient policy-executing role of \"staff\". Moreover, the VeriSign amendments do represent significant\nchanges of Domain Name policy.  And the ICANN bylaws dictate that such\nmatters be delegated to the DNSO unless the board makes a finding that there are\nfacts to bypass that clearly defined requirement to delegate to the DNSO. \nThe board has not made any such finding with respect to the VeriSign amendments. \nI recognize the argument that says that the VeriSign amendments were not\n\"policy\" changes, but I am not persuaded by them. With regard to the DNSO, it is my perception that it is a body\nthat is wracked with internal problems and structural biases.  As such I\nhave a difficult time giving credence to its actions.  This makes it very\ndifficult with regard to the fact that much as it is procedurally critical to\ndelegate matters such as the VeriSign amendments to the DNSO, it is equally\ndifficult to believe that the DNSO would be able to synthesize a decision that\ncould be considered as having been fairly decided by all parts of the Internet\ncommunity. As an example of this lack of credibility of the DNSO, I am\nparticularly concerned how the DNSO's Names Council eviscerated the proposals\nfor structural reform of the DNSO that came out of the DNSO working group\nfocused on those questions. Now for the resolutions themselves:"

My affirmative vote was the result of inadequate time to study\nand to receive public input.  I have since learned various things about\nthese contracts that, had I known at the time, would have made me vote against\napproval. I knee-jerk accepted these contracts based on a desire to move\nthe long-delayed TLD process.  I am now resolved to not let myself be\nrailroaded by last-minute \"staff\" agendas to accept something that I\ndo not believe has received adequate review by myself or the public. Among the matters that I learned about too late were the concern\nthat these contracts may establish what amounts to a \"most favored\nregistry\" situation in which incumbent registries may be able to use these\ncontracts as a means to prevent experimentation and evolution of new contractual\nvehicles with respect to subsequent registries. Another such matter was the nature of the buy-out situation that\nmay occur when a registry contract comes up for renewal. Similarly, I was unaware of the lack of an effective \"full\nstop\" mechanism or other protective means that would, to my way of\nthinking, be necessary parts of any live experiment or test, such as these new\nTLDs are purported to be."
