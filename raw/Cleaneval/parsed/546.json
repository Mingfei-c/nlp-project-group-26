      "text": "This summer, a dramatic change will take place on the first floor of the McLaughlin library as it is transformed to meet the growing demand for programs provided by the Learning Commons. In 2004, the Commons recorded more than 20,000 student visits, a dramatic increase from 2003. Preparation for this transformation began last fall. The Information Technology Help Desk was placed beside the Research Help Desk (formerly named the Reference Desk), creating a new synergy for dealing quickly and efficiently with questions and requests. Next, the journal collection on the second floor was evaluated and condensed. Some issues were donated to the National Library of Canada's Book Exchange Centre. Through its resource-sharing and redistribution activities, the Centre helps Canadian libraries arrange for the exchange of publications deemed surplus by one library to another. Finally, the first floor Reference collection was moved to the second floor, leaving essentially the whole first floor for the Learning Commons. Over the summer months, the first floor will be painted and re-carpeted, the signage will be improved, and the front doors as well as the detection system replaced. In addition, upgrades to learning space will take place on the first to third floors. These will include:"

      "text": "In 1999, the University of Guelph embarked on a bold new initiative aimed at helping students reach their full academic potential. Realizing that learning is social and can be done in a community, we developed a Learning Commons - a new concept of learning support for students. Its essence and its strength is its simplicity. Access to learning, writing, researching and technology support is provided to students in one place - the Library. Funding for the Learning Commons is provided by the University, industry, foundation, parent, alumni and friend support. Learn more about the Learning Commons . The Learning Commons program at the University of Guelph is considered the best of its kind in Canada. It features:"

      "text": "Learning Services – addresses such topics as learning from lectures, exam preparation, critical reading, and effective group work and presentation skills. Students are given one-on-one or group instruction. Writing Services - available to undergraduate and graduate students to enhance their writing skills. Skills sessions are offered on lab reports, literature reviews, book reports and theses. Students can access individual assistance, drop-in support or workshops. Supported Learning Groups (SLG) - group study sessions that integrate a review of course content with training in learning strategies and study skills. The sessions are led by senior students who have achieved high marks in particularly challenging courses. IT Help Desk - staffed by Computing and Communication Services Student Consultants who help students, faculty and staff solve IT-related questions or problems. Research Help – professional library staff answers questions about library resources and services, provides reference support and conducts seminars and Library tours. Web-based research support is also available through Virtual Reference services, and online guides and tutorials. The Library Centre for Students with Disabilities - provides a range of services and adaptive software that enables students with disabilities to read, write and research more effectively."

      "text": "One of the most important elements of the Learning Commons approach is that much of the programming involves students helping other students through the use of peer helpers.  Selected from a range of disciplines through a rigorous process that assesses their academic achievement and communication skills, peer helpers embody the University's commitment to experiential learning. Peer helpers make a difference to their fellow students while at the same time enjoying an opportunity for their own personal growth and development. Their comments on the experience - “an invaluable experience”, “full of learning and laughter”, “the most rewarding part of my undergraduate experience” - reflect the success of this program. The Learning Commons has 78 exceptional learning peers, writing peers and Supported Learning Group peers, each of whom commits an average of 5 to 10 hours per week to helping their fellow students. next article>>"
