      "text": "Everyone negotiates. We negotiate with family members about how to spend \r\n\t\tvacation time; we negotiate with friends about how to pick up the tab \r\n\t\tfor dinner; we negotiate with contractors about when to come to the house \r\n\t\tfor a delivery or repairs. Physicians negotiate with patients when discussing \r\n\t\talternatives of medical versus surgical therapy or, often times, no therapy. \r\n\t\tScientists negotiate for time and space to conduct experiments. All of \r\n\t\tus negotiate for salary and job responsibilities. While each of these \r\n\t\texamples has a different level of risk and impact on the outcome, each \r\n\t\trequires basic communication skills to be effective. Richard Shell, in his book, Bargaining for Advantage (Penguin Books, \r\n\t\t1999) defines negotiation as \"an interactive communication process \r\n\t\tthat may take place whenever we want something from someone else or another \r\n\t\tperson wants something from us.\" Shell describes the process in four \r\n\t\tstages: Preparation, Exchanging Information, Bargaining, and Closing and \r\n\t\tCommitment. This article explores the four phases using examples from common interactions \r\n\t\tof faculty negotiating for new positions in medical schools. The examples \r\n\t\tare drawn in part from vignettes discussed during sessions on negotiation \r\n\t\tduring the 2004 AAMC Annual Meeting and the 2004 Executive Development \r\n\t\tSeminar for Associate Deans and Chairs."

Simple advice, but worth emphasizing. Preparation \r\n\t\tincludes researching standards and principles by which negotiating parties \r\n\t\tmay reach common ground. Preparation includes knowledge of your own values \r\n\t\ton the issue being negotiated as well as knowledge of the perceived needs \r\n\t\tand values of the other parties involved in the discussion. It is important \r\n\t\tto be aware of your own bargaining style as well as that of the other \r\n\t\tparty.

      "text": "Many observational studies since 1978 have confirmed the importance of \r\n\t\tthese basic communications skills in effective negotiation. Henry Ford \r\n\t\tgave advice on such communication: \"If there is any one secret of success\" \r\n\t\the said, \"it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view \r\n\t\tand see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.\" Why \r\n\t\tare communication skills so important in this particular kind of interaction? \r\n\t\tShell surmises, \"Most people are so grateful to have an attentive audience \r\n\t\tthat they take little notice of your tactful probing until they suddenly \r\n\t\tfeel the urge to get a few answers themselves. By then the effective negotiator \r\n\t\thas the information he or she needs to frame just the right responses.\" Dr. Timothy Johnson, \"Be the \r\n\t\t\t  development officer for your own ideas and programs.\" When Dr. Timothy Johnson investigated the position as Chair of Obstetrics \r\n\t\tand Gynecology at the University of Michigan, he interviewed a variety \r\n\t\tof decision-makers within the department and the medical school. The result \r\n\t\tof the conversations and his reflection upon what possible to build in \r\n\t\tthe medical school was an 18-page vision and planning document. This document \r\n\t\treflected the visions and possibilities of the department and the medical \r\n\t\tschool and required very little negotiation to reach agreement because \r\n\t\tof the shared interests and common ground for those with whom he would \r\n\t\teventually develop the vision. And how did he discover the shared interests \r\n\t\tand the potential for building a great department? Through inquiry, listening, \r\n\t\tclarifying, and developing shared interests."

      "text": "Bargaining is the stage that most people associate with negotiation. \r\n\t\tHowever, this stage alone is NOT negotiating. It begins with an exchange \r\n\t\tof terms, an opening of the discussion of a \"deal\". Dr. Steve Blum teaches \r\n\t\tAAMC EDS participants to delay this stage as long as reasonable, but to \r\n\t\trecognize when it begins. He teachers, \"As soon as a number or term is \r\n\t\tmentioned by one party, you have begun to move out of information exchange \r\n\t\tand into bargaining.\" In negotiations that have proceeded well through \r\n\t\tthe stage of information exchange, this transition occurs smoothly as \r\n\t\ta natural extension of how to enact the ideas that have emerged. If exchange \r\n\t\tis done effectively, both parties are likely to have discovered a number \r\n\t\tof different resolutions that are more attractive than the ideas brought \r\n\t\tto the initial discussion by either party. Drs. Dee Fenner and Jayne Thorson \r\n\t\t\t  of the University of Michigan College of Medicine. \"Ask for \r\n\t\t\t  what you need and aim high.\" Both parties are also more likely to be pleased with their final transaction \r\n\t\tif they come to the discussion with their very best case scenario in mind. \r\n\t\tThe old adage \"think positive\" is the right one for negotiation. King \r\n\t\tChing of Chou in the 12th century is reported to have said, \"High achievement \r\n\t\tcomes from high aims.\" When negotiating, think about meeting mutual needs \r\n\t\tand desires with complementary solutions. Of course, one must prepare \r\n\t\twell by knowing the bottom line, or Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement. \r\n\t\t(We will talk more about BATNA in a subsequent issue.) And, of course \r\n\t\tit is important to know one's values so as not to compromise them. However, \r\n\t\tthe best bargaining will result in all parties feeling as though they \r\n\t\thave acquired value and lost little or none. This happens when the negotiators \r\n\t\tspend sufficient time prior to the bargaining stage to discover common \r\n\t\tground on values and mutual benefit in exchanging properties or ideas. The substantive changes in curriculum that are becoming established across \r\n\t\tthe nation are the results of effective negotiation with many individuals \r\n\t\twith many interests. The \"bargain\" is often a method of increasing one \r\n\t\tdepartment's visibility in return for support for more dispersed or integrated \r\n\t\tteaching. Often, this requires negotiation of a new method of distributing \r\n\t\tfunds to departments to recognize teaching effort and always a consideration \r\n\t\tof how these new distribution methods impact upon departmental and divisional \r\n\t\tbudgeting. Each of these is a result of a bargaining process that builds \r\n\t\tinto the larger vision of more effective teaching, learning, and organizational \r\n\t\tinnovation."

      "text": "When various options have been fully explored, weighted by each party, \r\n\t\tand often adjusted, closing may occur. Blum tells us that we obtain true \r\n\t\tcommitment from the other party \"when the alternatives are not as attractive \r\n\t\tas following through on the deal. \" In an effective negotiation, both \r\n\t\tparties will come to this point of best possible combination of terms \r\n\t\tin a similar time frame. Robert Frost said, \"Good fences make good neighbors.\" A strong and visible \r\n\t\tclosing and definition of terms facilitates an ongoing, trustworthy relationship. \r\n\t\tOne might say of bargaining, \"a good contract makes a good bargain-and \r\n\t\ta potential long term relationship that will continue to benefit both \r\n\t\tparties. In the Unites States, a symbolic handshake signifies a verbal \r\n\t\tagreement. Signing a contract or memorandum of understanding or placing \r\n\t\tfunds in escrow shows good faith intention to follow through on the agreement. \r\n\t\tA public announcement such as a press release or presentation at an important \r\n\t\tmeeting gives credence to the plan."

      "text": "\"In the last analysis, you cannot learn negotiating techniques from \r\n\t\ta book. You must actually negotiate.\" - Freund, Anatomy of a Merger 1975 The best way to improve your negotiation effectiveness is to be conscious \r\n\t\tof your own opportunities and consciously work to improve your skill. \r\n\t\tBlum credits Shell in teaching that effective negotiators share similar \r\n\t\tcharacteristics. They all: engage in systematic planning and preparation have high expectations maintain a reputation for reliability and integrity exhibit strong listening skills, knowledge of subject matter, verbal \r\n\t\t  skills and self-confidence. Fortunately, these are all characteristics that are important for academic \r\n\t\tsuccess as well. Whether your focus is clinical care, educational innovation, \r\n\t\tor scientific research, you likely have developed considerable foundation \r\n\t\tin each of these skills and traits. Using the four stages, you should \r\n\t\tbe able to enhance your negotiation effectiveness. At the 2004 AAMC Annual \r\n\t\tmeeting, Drs. Jayne Thorson, Tim Johnson, and Dee Fenner from the University \r\n\t\tof Michigan College of Medicine shared some basic tips for negotiating \r\n\t\tnew positions in academics. All rely on the basic stages of negotiation, \r\n\t\tstages that Dr. Fenner describes as \"a universal dance with four steps.\" Tips on negotiating for a new position in academics -- from the WIM Annual Meeting session, Negotiating for your \r\n\t\t\t  success Jayne Thorson, Tim Johnson, Dee Fenner Know what you need to meet your goals and establish targets \r\n\t\t\t\tof 6 months, one year, five years. In discussing a new position, \r\n\t\t\t\tbe sure to address the metrics by which success is measured in \r\n\t\t\t\tthe new organization. Ask questions that require a concrete response: If I were to take this position, what actions or outcomes \r\n\t\t\t\t\twould make you think of me as a success? Who are the successful people in this organization? Why? \r\n\t\t\t\t\t(Then you should ask to meet with them.) At the end of one year, two years, five years, how will \r\n\t\t\t\t\tyou judge my success? Use the responses to #1 to construct a 1, 2, and 5 year plan \r\n\t\t\t\tin writing. Be sure to state your interests and needs rather than \r\n\t\t\t\tmaking demands. Aim high. Why? \"You'll be more likely to hit the \r\n\t\t\t\ttarget\". Find out how decisions are made in the organization. Be sure \r\n\t\t\t\tto negotiate with the person who makes the real decisions. Listen for what is said and what is NOT said. Plan short, clear \r\n\t\t\t\tquestions in advance and ask with a purpose."
