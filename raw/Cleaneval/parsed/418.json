      "text": "WARNER:  The Committee will now come to order.  We have before us  a very distinguished\narray of aviators this morning.  And our  subcommittee, as the first hearing, leads off with some\nof the tough  challenges.  And we welcome you. I'm going to put brief remarks in the record, but just sitting  here thinking back over a lifetime\nof my own if I had to figure out,  Senator Levin, one or two disappointments in my lifetime -- the\nfirst  was not achieving Navy gold wings.  But unfortunately World War II had  ended, and they\ndidn't need a lot of youngsters in the pipeline  anymore and we all went home. But, ever since then I've been highly envious of those of you who  sought as your professions\n-- aviation.  It's a very challenging,  high-risk occupation.  I realize, and I think most realize,\nevery day  you get in that cockpit there's a certain measure of personal risk.    \n     I want to thank each of you and tens of thousands like you, where  ever they are today, for\nhaving made this contribution to our nation's  security. The work of this Committee, however, is to try and evaluate the  various programs brought\nforth by the commander-in-chief, the  President, to the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretaries\nof the Air  Force and Navy.  And therein again, I've had the privilege of having a  good deal of\nexperience through the years. And it's particularly sad for me to address this morning the F-14  program -- a program that\nwas brought in while I served in the  Department of the Navy, and have spent a good many hours\nin the rear  seat of that aircraft in the early days.  But it's a fine airplane.  It has served the country\nwell.  And I hope that we can put fixes in  to allow it to continue to have service to the nation for\nsuch service  life technically as we can get out of it. The JAST program -- I was sort of sitting here scratching a note  or two -- the challenges here\nare almost like going to the moon.  And  this time it's TAC Air.  There's a high technical risk. \nThere's a  high financial risk.  And there's a high political risk.   All three  of them are wrapped\nup in this program. And we're very anxious to hear from you this morning on that,  General, so I won't take\nfurther time.  We're anxious to hear from the  witnesses, but I'd like to hear from my\ndistinguished colleague. LEVIN:  We've been together now, we came together some 18 years  ago to the United States\nSenate and we've worked side by side.  We've  traveled the world together with pretty\nchallenging assignments.  And  who knows, with a little luck, we might be sitting here for a\nwhile  longer. WARNER:  Well, I'm privileged to have you... LEVIN:  Well, I agree with that too... WARNER:  ...the ranking member of our subcommittee. LEVIN:  And I just want to thank you, Senator Warner.  It has been indeed a privilege to\nwork with you for these many  years, and whether I'm Chairing a subcommittee and you're\nranking  member, or you're Chairing and I'm ranking member, we're working on so  many other\nthings, we've always worked together in a spirit of  cooperation. Some of these people ask me about the U.S. Senate -- it must be  difficult to work in the U.S.\nSenate these days.  And I always say,  No, you must be thinking of the House of Representatives,\nbecause we  really work together very well as team in the Senate. And we've alternated whose been the majority over this decade-  and-a-half and regardless of\nwho's in the majority and who's in the  minority it's worked out very well.  And ours staff have\nworked  together consistently, so that's going to be the order of the day  again.  And it's\nnecessary, because of the challenges we face -- not  as challenging as what you folks have faced\nin the cockpits over the  years, but nonetheless, a different kind of challenge, And the Chairman's mentioned a number of them, including a JAST  program and some of\nour other acquisitions.  You know, why for  instance, are we buying more F-15s and F-16s at this\ntime? That's a question that's very much on my mind as to whether that  makes sense for us to do\nthat.  But I agree with the chairman.  I  think the JAST program is one that we're going to have to\npay a lot of  attention to because of the number of challenges that it presents. I'm interested in the digitization issue as to why we're not  making as much progress with our\nsituational awareness in the air as  the Army has done with its digitization program on the\nground, which  has given it tremendous situation awareness.  That's something that  this\nsubcommittee has been pressing for many years, as well. So, Mr. Chairman, I also will put some remarks in the record  which are in more detail.  But I\njust want to join you in welcoming  our witnesses and thanking them for their presence, for their \ncontribution over the years, and again, saying how much I look forward  to working with you this\nyear again. WARNER:  Fine.  All right, General.  Turn up the engine. MCGINN:  Didn't preflight this very well.  Can you hear me, sir? WARNER:  Yeah, we can hear you great. MCGINN:  Well, it's an honor to be with you this morning and talk  about issues of such... WARNER:  But you will need to draw that up somewhat... MCGINN:  OK. WARNED:  ...somewhat more closely. MCGINN:  It's an honor to be with you this morning and talk about  issues that are so\nimportant to our great nation, because in my view  they're key to joint warfighting, today and to\nour success in the  future.  And that's air power. With your approval, what I'd like to do is submit my opening  remarks for the record ... WARNER:  No objection.  No objection. MCGINN:  ... and in those remarks, as well as in the other  prepared statements that we've\nsubmitted to the Committee, we  addressed those questions you asked in your letter of invitation\nto  appear before the Committee. WARNER:  Thank you. EBERHART:  Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a  privilege and a pleasure\nfor me to appear before you to present an  overview of Naval Aviation's present tactical\ncapabilities, and our  vision for the future.  I would also to abbreviate my time here and  opening\nremarks and submit them for them the record. WARNER:  No objection. EBERHART:  I would like to, Senator Warner, make an offer, if you  can find the time I'll\ntalk to Admiral T. Ball Hayden, the chief of  our Naval Air Training, and see if we can get you a\nslot down there in  Pensacola to come down. WARNER:  I hate to tell you.  I started in the Yellow Peril,  which was the old biplane with\ncanvas and whatever was in it -- I  don't know.  I do know those days are gone.  Thank you very\nmuch. EBERHART:  Yes, sir. And I'd like to also recount just briefly that I had a phone  conversation this morning with\nAdmiral Hank Giffen, the commander  of the George Washington battle group.  He's preparing\nthat aircraft  carrier and his battle group to transit the Suez Canal later on today.  They're en route\nto the Persian Gulf to work for the CINC Central  Command. Admiral Lyle Bien  and his battle group on the Nimitz is  steaming across the Indian Ocean en\nroute to the vicinity of Taiwan,  where they will join Admiral Jim Ellis  and the Independence \nbattle group in providing that tremendously capable presence to  hopefully stabilize that area. With that, sir, I look forward to answering any questions that you and  the subcommittee\nmembers may have. WARNER:  Admiral. STEIDLE:  Sir.  Good morning, sir.  I'm Craig Steidle.  I'm the  program director for the\nJAST program. Sir, I thank you very much for your invitation to be here to  discuss the Joint Advance Strike\nTechnology program, a program that  has just transitioned to the Joint Strike Fighter program. \nBecause it  has been so dynamic, I have a short brief statement.  I also have a  more detailed\nlonger version I'll submit, sir. WARNER:  Well, all statements in their entirety will be admitted  to the record, and you may\nproceed with your short statement. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  Thank you. Sir, we have matured from the JAST program and are now converging  on an affordable\nsolution that meets requirements of all three  services, plus our allies -- the Navy, Marine Corps\nand the Air Force  as well as our allies.  Specific focus on the program remains  affordability --\nreducing the development costs, production costs,  costs of ownership of Joint Strike Fighter\nfamily of airplanes. We've fully merged the advanced research and project agencies,  ASTOVL, Advanced Short\nTake-Off and Vertical Landing program, into the  Joint Strike Fighter program.  And additionally\nthe United Kingdom  Royal Navy has joined the program as a collaborative partner.  They  are\ncommitting $200 million to the program in accordance with the  terms of an MOU that we signed\nin December of '95. Interest has been extremely high in other foreign countries.  We've provided several different\nbriefings, and I expect the interest  to continue at a high level. The program focuses on a new approach for weapons systems  acquisition.  We applied the\nrecommendations of the Packard commission  and other experts in acquisition reform.  We\ncreated an environment  that provides early interaction between the warfighters and the \ntechnologists in order to be able to make cost and performance trades  early.  And that's been a\nsignificant part of the program. We've done this by utilizing the integrated product development  team process.  Industry is a\nfull partner in this process, and they  welcome this tremendously.  They have been very positive\nin our  process and our way of doing business. The first formal product that came out of this integrated  industry-warfighter technologists\ngroup and teaming relationship was  our initial requirements document that was signed by all\nthree  services last August, and was submitted, approved and endorsed by the  JROC in August\nof last year. We continue to be a role model for acquisition reform and  streamlining a lot of initiatives in\ncoherence with our industrial  partner.  We're just completing the concept definition phase. We'll finish that phase this summer, and then move on into the  concept development phase\nwhere we will downsize from three teams that  we have today to two teams.  Each one of the\nteams will build  demonstrators demonstrating commonality, hovering transition, flying \nqualities, as well as continue with our research and development  technology maturation\nprograms. STEIDLE:  Each one of the contractors will demonstrate two  aircraft, and demonstrate the\nparticular attributes that I just  mentioned.  In conclusion, sir, we strongly... WARNER:  Let's just stop a minute.  That's a total of -- what? --  six aircraft? STEIDLE:  No, sir.  That'll be two aircraft.  We'll downsize to  two concept development\nteams, and each one of those teams will fly  two airplanes each. WARNER:  So that's four? STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  Four airplanes, yes, sir. So, in my concluding remarks, sir, the services stand extremely  committed to the program as\ndoes OSD and industry.  And I stand by to  answer any of your questions, sir. WARNER:  One of the questions I will ask -- and I was going to  send this up so you could\nread it if you haven't.  I'm sure you have  read the New York Times article. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  I have. WARNER:  And I'm going to ask you momentarily if you would sort  of give us a side by\nside as to -- it appears to me to be very well  written and researched.  But since it's a significant\npiece on this  article -- and I commend the paper and the writer -- I want to make  sure our record\nshows any areas of which you as the manager disagree. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir. WARNER:  So you have it there. STEIDLE:  No, sir.  I don't, but I do remember the article. WARNER:  Well, I'll tell you what I'll do.  I'll get it  reproduced for you and sent right up\nthere. STEIDLE:  Thank you. WARNER:  General. MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, Senator, good morning.  I thank you for  the opportunity to appear\nbefore you to discuss Marine Corps tactical  aviation. I also have, in addition to the formal statement, I have some  short opening remarks which I\nwould prefer to submit for the record.  And I would like to also add that on behalf of the strong\nsupport of  the Congress and the people of the United States, the Marine Corps has  always been\nready to be -- whether it's forward deployed or on bases  in the United States -- to continue to be\nAmerica's 911 force. In addition to the forward deployed forces that Admiral McGinn  has mentioned and, of\ncourse, my Air Force wingmen has around the  world, today you have Marines and F-18Ds and\nE-A6Bs poised in Aviano  to support American and allied forces in Bosnia.  There are Marine \nforces forward deployed in Okinawa and on the main islands of Japan  ready to support\ncontingencies there.  And as our Commandant has  said... WARNER: I visited the Marines in Aviano on my last trip there. MAGNUS:  Yes, Sir. And there are Marines embarked on amphibious ships across the  globe supporting the carrier\nbattle forces with our Vietnam-era  helicopters prepared to do the nation's bidding. All I can say to echo our Commandant is readiness is our  business.  And we stand by to\nanswer your questions. WARNER:  All right, gentlemen.  What I would like to do is to  start with you, General\nEberhart. And I presume you've had an opportunity to have reviewed to some  extent the record\nof this subcommittee as it reviewed the 22 program  last year.  And our major concern with the\nsubject of concurrency.  Would you start, sort of as a threshold where we left off last  year, how\nthe '96 program has unfolded to date, and what you would  hope to do on concurrency issue in\nthe '97. EBERHART:  Sir, I have reviewed the concurrency issue.  With your  permission, I'd like to\ngo back just a little bit further though and  talk about -- we were concerned with concurrency\nfrom the very  beginning to make sure that we were going to get this correct.  As such, we looked\nat what the Packard Commission said about  concurrency. EBERHART:  We think this program complies with the, what was  pointed out in the Packard\nCommission.  Rand looked at the concurrency  issue.  They commented favorably in terms of\nconcurrency in the F-22. And just to make sure that we had it right, as you know, the  Defense\nScience Board looked at this issue and submitted a report in  1995, which in our view supports\nthe fact that it's not too  concurrent. There is some concurrency.  We think there will be\nconcurrency in  most all programs today.  But we're comfortable with that concurrency.  We\nthink it's under control. WARNER:  We added to be 70-odd aircraft in operational status  before the last milestone is\ncompleted under -- is it the T&E program? EBERHART:  Sir, before we go to full-rate production, there'll be  70-some-odd airplanes. As\nyou know, when we looked at the acquisition reform of '94,  they recommended approximately\n10 percent, which, if had we stayed  with the original buy of about 700 and some-odd, 10 percent\nwould have  been 70-some-odd.  But as we've drawn down the total buy, and also  extended the\nperiod of EMD, we think that's a natural consequence that  we will in fact have more airplanes as\nwe go to full-rate production  than this 10 percent guideline talks about. But we think the important parts -- and they have been, once  again, authenticated by the\nreports that we talked about -- is first  of all, the DT&E, which we think is most important, will\nbe finished  essentially by the time we have four airplanes. WARNER:  For the record, spell out, I know what DT&E... EBERHART:  Development Test and Evaluation. WARNER:  Right. EBERHART:  And then the initial operations test and evaluation,  the Rand Corporation said\nmost problems unfold between the 10 and 20  percent point in IOT&E.  And we will in fact have\n27 percent of IOT&E.  For these reasons, sir, we believe that concurrency is just about  right in\nthis program.  We'll continue to watch it.  We're concerned  about it just as you are, but we think\nit's on the mark. WARNER:  Now, each of the us have different views.  I think it's,  really, one of the highest\nrates of concurrency that I've experienced. But that, in your judgment -- and General Fogelman\nhas testified  this week before this committee -- that degree of concurrency is  driven by the\nthreat assessment that has been made by a variety of  sources, by traditional sources, such that to\nhave U.S. air dominance  in the theater, in the time frame when this plane is scheduled to come \nin, it simply has to have that number of aircraft, and that design of  aircraft, to meet that threat. \nIs that a fair summary? EBERHART:  Sir, we're concerned about air dominance.  We're  concerned about insuring\nthat we have air dominance as quickly as  possible.  And in our view, the F-22 does that for us.\nBut again, when you look at the number of airplanes, the 70-some-  odd, by the time we go to\nfull rate, if we go back to some of the  other factors we talked about in terms of an extended\nEMD in having a  bi-profile that makes sense. WARNER:  Well, but it's the threat scenario that's driving that  quantum of concurrency.  And\nthat depends on individuals to how you  want to quantify it.  I mean, you very carefully have\nquantified it  from a technical perspective. WARNER:  I just quantify it based on past experience.  I mean  this Committee has gone\nthrough a number of aircraft programs that  have not materialized as originally envisioned. Let's\ntalk about your fly-away costs for 22.  Considering the  changes in the program to date -- and\nthere has been a reassessment of  weight -- General Fogleman went into that. Did you have an\nopportunity to be debriefed on what he said on  weight? EBERHART:  Yes, Sir, I did. WARNER:  To capsule the weight issue, as I recall it, was that he  decided he could make a\ndegradation in the envelope, and thereby allow  an increase in the weight.  And that degradation\nin his professional  judgement would not substantially in any way affect the performance of  this\naircraft to meet the threats. Is that correct? EBERHART:  Yes, Sir.  That's essentially correct.  There's a  little more to it, but that's... WARNER:  Well, why don't you put that in? EBERHART:  Yes, Sir.  I think that when you look at the weight of  the airplane, it's still\nabout 2,500 pounds below what we think the  max allowable weight would be for this airplane.\nWe did look at -- and I think you know, and you referenced the  testimony last year -- that in fact,\nat that time, we were concerned  about the weight growth that we had seen to that time.  And\nwe've  taken very aggressive measures to bring this under control.  And we  think we have today\nto include weighing, to reviewing it every other  week, to reporting it to the program manager. We have actually had the opportunity now to weigh some of the  parts.  In fact, we've\nweighed about ten percent of the parts -- the  actual parts that we've cut -- and we're plus 30\npounds out of this  whole 3,000 pounds that we've weighed. And then when we've look at\navionics, we've weighed hundreds of  pieces and we're minus ten pounds. So we think we have\ngood understanding that our model is on  track. The situation you're talking about is where we looked at the  weight that we had at that time,\nand what it was going to take in  terms of thrust to get us the G available at 1.0 on the\nperformance  curve. We looked at what that would cost us in terms of dollars to  insure a very small change in G\navailable.  I'm talking .0 something  in terms of Gs.  Very negligible.  We looked at what that\nmeant in  terms of operational capability.  And we believed that was negligible  -- and it wasn't\njust the Air Force, Sir, we vetted this and vetted  this through the JROC process with the other\nvice chiefs, the vice  chairman and the chairman and the CINCs to make sure everyone \nunderstood what this meant -- negligible in terms of operational  capability. I guess the bottom\nline is we looked at it based on what it would  cost us to keep that .0X amount of Gs at this one\npoint on the  performance curve, and we didn't think the cost was worth it. WARNER:  Let's return momentarily and then I'll yield to my  colleague.  About the fly-away\ncost, what do you estimate the fly-away  cost of 22 in the fiscal '96 dollars? EBERHART:  Sir, I'll -- I get the fly-away costs confused a  little bit here, so let me make\nsure that I understand it.  I think  it's around $70 million, but let me check that for you to make\nsure I  have it right. It's $71.2, Sir.  For the record, $71.2. WARNER:  $71.2. EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. WARNER:  And that's predicated on 442 units? EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. WARNER:  Senator Levin. LEVIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. LEVIN:  On the F-22 concurrency issue first.  Is there more or  less concurrency with the\nreduced buy? EBERHART:  Sir, in terms of the reduced buy, coupled with  stretching out EMD, there is\nless concurrency. LEVIN:  So that even though we're buying a greater percentage --  put it -- no -- even though\nthe full rate production of the F-22 is  for a smaller percentage of the total buy, the concurrency\nhas  actually been reduced. EBERHART:  Sir, I believe that once you stretch out EMD, and you  have longer to work\nthese issues and the IOC moves right -- the  initial operation capability -- and you have more\ntime to work this  test and evaluation phase, that that reduces the concurrency. LEVIN:  Now you, in answer to the Chairman's question as to  whether or not the schedule\nfor the F-22 is threat driven, answered,  as I understand it, that it is in fact not being driven by the\nthreat.  But I'd like you to put that in your own words. Are we producing this based on what is a proper, safe, rate of  development, or are we\nproducing this quicker than that in order to  meet some kind of a presumed threat that we're\ngoing to face in the  out years? EBERHART:  Sir, I think that in every case, this is a balance  between the threat that we\nanticipate and what we think is acceptable  concurrency, and acceptable and affordable rate of\nproduction. So I think we balance those two things, and that's how we decide  what the IOC is. LEVIN:  Has the concurrency rate changed in the last two years  for the F-22? EBERHART:  Sir, I have not addressed a question specifically like  that, and I'm not an\nacquisition expert. I will provide for the record my view that we have stretched out  EMD over\nthe last couple of years.  We've moved the IOC right.  So to  me, as an operator, that means that\nthe concurrency -- it's not as  concurrent. Now I'll have to ask the acquisition experts if they\nagree, if  their definition of concurrency is the same as mine. LEVIN:  OK.  So that from your operator's perspective, there's  less concurrency now in this\nprogram than there was two years ago? EBERHART:  That would be my view as an operator.  Yes, Sir. LEVIN:  I think it would be useful to give us those charts  showing us those timelines\ncomparing for us the milestones that exist  now to what they looked like two years ago.  I think it\nwould be  helpful... EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. LEVIN:  ... to do that for the record. Now the Science Board found that for the F-22, that\nengine  development and passive avionics were the highest risk areas in terms  of concurrency. EBERHART:  Yes, Sir. LEVIN:  Could you comment on that? EBELHART:  Yes, sir.  And, in fact, I had the privilege of going  down to Pratt & Whitney at\nWest Palm a couple of weeks ago and looking  at the engine on the stand and receiving extensive\nbriefings on where  they were a year ago -- and where they were two years ago and where  they\nare. It's very impressive, the steps they have taken to make sure that  this airplane and the engine\nwill be ready for a first flight in May  of '97.  And I'm convinced it will.  But the types of\nredesign we have  done to include the advances with the Howell  blade, we're  convinced that\nthat will in fact work.  It has tested so well on the  test band, on the test stand, and it's a go for\nMay of '97 for the  maiden flight. LEVIN:  The science board report indicated that about 20 percent  of the avionics testing was\ngoing to be completed before the Lot 2   contract award.  And as I understand, Lot 2  begins at\nwhat  plane?  Give me their... EBERHART:  Sir, I don't have that in front of me.  We'll see if  we can get it behind here, if\nnot, we will submit that for the record. LEVIN:  OK.  Well, my question doesn't depend on the answer to  that.  So whatever the\nplane number is where Lot 2  begins, it was  our understanding from the science board report that\nthe avionics  testing would be 20 percent completed before that point.  OK?  Now, in  terms of\nthe engine testing, we did not have a specific number.  Do  you know what that number is? In\nother words, what percentage of the engine testing was to be  completed prior to Lot 2 \nproduction? EBERHART:  I do not know, sir.  I'll have to submit that for the  record. LEVIN:  OK.  That'll be fine.  Do you know how much of the  testing, the engine testing, is\ngoing to be actual testing as compared  to modeling and simulation?  Is that something you\nwould know off-  hand? EBERHART:  No, sir.  I'm sorry.  I'll submit that for the record. LEVIN:  No, there's no problem.  That's fine.  Just submit that  for the record. EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  Again, as an operator -- going down there,  visiting at Pratt &\nWhitney, I was very impressed with what I saw. LEVIN:  There was a question, Admiral McGinn on concurrency on  the F-18 E&F  and even\nthough it is a concurrency question so let  me use this moment to ask you about that. I think that\nat yesterday's hearing, Senator Warner noted that  there would 76 F-22s that would be authorized\nand appropriated by  Congress when the operational testing on the F-22 is completed.  Believe\nthat was the figure that was used. Now the F-18 E&F  program, it would appear that Congress will  have authorized and\nappropriated funds for 114 E&Fs  before  operational testing is completed.  Now is that not even\na greater  concurrency issue then on the E&Fs  than it would be on the F-22s  if those numbers\nare correct or approximately correct? MCGINN:  Senator Levin I'd like to turn to my colleague Craig  Steidle who was a former\nprogram manager for the F/A18-E/F and I think he  can give you a more informed answer on\nthat. STEIDLE:  Sir, if you don't mind, I'll answer that.  When we put  that program together it was\na non-concurrent program with  demonstrated performance at every milestone.  Before we had\napproval  to go on with the first LRIP  buy, we had first flight.  But  before we were allowed to\ngo for the second one, we had demonstrated  250 glides  and flying of all seven test articles. \nBefore we went  on for the third LRIP  we had another demonstrated performance.  So it was a\nvery non-concurrent program with demonstrated performance. The operational testing of that particular aircraft started very  early in the simulators with\nenough  assessment, first of all, and  there was a long string.  The operational testing finishes\nwhen we  have a full suite  of aircraft -- full suite  of weapons in  the inventory, but the airplane\nis fielded before that with a list of  required weapons suites  that the service has provided for us. \nSo  -- I'm sorry -- but it is demonstrated performance doing milestones  which continues on\nthroughout the process. LEVIN:  Has there been any change in those milestones during the  level of concurrency on E\nand Fs? STEIDLE:  No, sir.  There hasn't.  We've been on schedule, on  performance all the way\nthrough.  It's worked well. WARNER:  Let me go back on the 22 concurrency, you're referring  to the science board\nreport of April, 1995, page 35.  Do you have a  copy of that with you, General. EBERHART:  I do now, sir. WARNER:  Just a rough calculation, the American taxpayers are  going to have about a half\nbillion dollars invested in airplanes  flying during this current cycle.  That's a lot of money.  I\noccurs to  me that we should have some assurance from Congress that if you in the  course of this\nprogram discover, Jerry  our problems.  And that's  going to exacerbate the concurrency problem. \nWhat procedures do we  have in place for first, addressing those problems internally and  making\nsuch adjustments to the program that may be required?  And  secondly, informing the Congress\npromptly of what you intend to do? EBERHART:  Sir, in terms of specific procedures in place, I don't  know.  I'll have to submit\nthat for the record.  I can tell you when  the issues that you've talked about earlier that reference\nthat point  on the performance curb where we are looking at what that would cost  us to stay with\nit and also when we looked at a range issue, that in  both cases, as soon as that was found out,\nthat came forward to Air  Force leadership, immediately went into the JROC  process and we \nwere over talking to members of your committee and yourself, sir, to  discuss those with you. EBERHART:  I pledge to you that we've learned from other  programs, other issues, that this\nbad news doesn't get better with  age; that we need to go ahead and address the issue.  And\neverybody  who has a stake in the action needs to know about it and be involved  in the\ncorrective action. In terms of the specific process or procedures that are in place,  I'll have to go\ncheck with the acquisition committee.  But watching  that first-hand at that time, I was the J  on\nthe Joint Staff and  I saw that unfold, which really gave me a good feeling about -- I  think it's\ntied to the new acquisition reform process and those types  of things. WARNER:  Just reading from page 35, quote, If there are  significant delays in the\naccomplishment of these key events and  they're described earlier, or if the performance levels\nachieved are  unacceptable, the program could be adjusted by staying at the four  aircraft per year\nproduction rate for an additional year. And you giving the committee the assurance that they're in\nplace  besieged us to make that prompt adjustment.  Is that correct?  And you  will provide for\nthe record? EBERHART:  Sir, I believe they're in place.  I will provide for  the record what they are.  If\nthey're not, I'll provide for the record  that they're not in place and then what we need to do to\nsatisfy that  requirement. WARNER:  And I would like just a sentence in the letter that this  matter has been reviewed\nby the secretary of the Air Force.  I just  think it's very important that a matter of this seriousness,\nthat the  secretary give you full support which you're entitled to make that  tough decision for the\ndepartment. EBERHART:  Sir, I agree, and I'm sure she will. WARNER:  It's very important representation to the committee.  Let's proceed on to another\nissue. LEVIN:  There's one... WARNER:  Yes, sure. LEVIN:  On that one question -- just on this issue, it's a --  we're going to need to be satisfied\non this concurrency issue.  I for  -- is not particularly satisfied with the answer that you gave to\nthe  chairman about whether or not this was not threat-driven or not. We are not going to take\nrisks, I hope, to in this program. that  are going to be driven by a threat when it seems to me we\nshould make  sure that we do not make mistakes in the building of this plane and I,  for one,\nwould rather it be done right in a year or two later than to  find that we've got to do a bunch of\nfixes on this plane.  So when you were asked whether or not it was threat-driven and  then when\nyou told me and your answer to that was non-committal when  the chairman asked you, and then\nwhen I asked you the question about  the level of risk and the concurrency and the same issue\nthat the  chairman raised, you talked about a delicate balance between getting  there as soon as\npossible which was your words. LEVIN:  I'm a little concerned when you say as soon as  possible.  I think I would have said\nit, I would have put a qualifier  before possible, like as soon as reasonably possible or with \nreasonable degree of certainty, or something in there to give us some  assurance on the\nconcurrency issue. But let me phrase the question this way, and you may not be able  to answer\nthis, General.  And if so, that's fine.  You can do it for  the record -- you don't have to worry\nabout that. But the science board's findings about the acceptable overlap in  the F-22 program\nbetween testing and production depends upon requiring  that the development and the testing --\nexcuse me -- must pass certain  key events which are identified.  And this was what the\nChairman was  referring to. In the C-17 program, which was also supposed to be operating on  an event-based schedule,\nthe production imperative kept us signing  contracts even though the events were slipping.  Now\nAdmiral Steidle,  on the F-18 description, said that we must meet key events before  releasing\nprocurement funds.  It was a very clear answer on that  question. And I think the Chairman's\nquestion may have been -- I may be  duplicating the Chairman's question, but if I am let me put\nthis in my  own words.  Is the Air Force committed to sticking to achieving  testing events as a\nnecessary prerequisite to signing the F-22  contract? EBERHART:  Sir, we certainly are. LEVIN:  Pardon? EBERHART:  We certainly are, yes.  We have to go through those  wickets, we have to\nestablish those goals before DABs and pre-DAB and  DRB decisions.  So we will have those\nmilestones before we can move  from one portion of the program to another.  And we're\ncommitted to  that.  I think... LEVIN:  And our contracts provide for that?  Our existing  contracts provide for that? EBERHART:  Sir, I assume... LEVIN:  Let us know, let us know that for the record. EBERHART:  Again, I'll have to provide that for the record. LEVIN:  We just don't -- we want to be moving here according to  testing events having been\nmet, not according to a schedule which is  set forth in a contract with a contractor.  That's the\npoint here, and  if you can give us that assurance for the record I think that at least  helps me out\nsome.  Thank you. EBERHART:  And back to your original question.  I think your  choice of words is probably\nmuch better than mine, but I think the  bottom line is that we are comfortable with the\nconcurrency.  We think  that the risk is acceptable, that we're not letting the threat drive  us to do\nsomething stupid, something dumb.  We're comfortable with  that balance.  And we're not -- as\nyou said, as soon as reasonably  possible is probably a better choice of words. LEVIN:  My memory goes back here not just to the C-17 but to the  B-1 and B-2... Yeah,\nwhere we --  you know, we had -- somehow or other  there was a window of vulnerability, and\nwe had to rush the B-1.  And  we made a mistake, made a lot of mistakes.  As a result, it didn't \nhave the capabilities that we wanted it to have. Instead of saying, look, let's build the B-2 and do\nit right and  take, if we have, quote, a little more vulnerability for a few more  years, my God,\nwe've got enough capability in that area anyway, let's  do it right. EBERHART:  Yes, sir. LEVIN:  Instead we, I think -- and I don't want to rehash the  whole B-1 battle -- but I think\nthe chairman's point is, and I would  agree, is that we really want to do the F-22 right, and we do\nnot want  a high-level of concurrency. And if that means we get it done a year or two years later,\nso be  it. EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  Sir, those lessons that you referenced are  not lost on the Air Force\neither, and we're very concerned about those  as we move forward. EBERHART:  And we're -- bottom line is we're comfortable with the  concurrency we see in\nthis program. LEVIN:  Well, you know, everybody has his own view.  In my view,  it's a very high degree\nof concurrency associated with a high degree  of risk and I've always been under the impression\nthat the threat that  was driving this not in a stupid area, but just we were at the outer  edge of the\nenvelope, as you say, you fly on the area of risk and  concurrency. And that was driven by the\nsurface-to-air threat.  And I seem to  have gained that from General Fogleman's testimony\nbecause it's --  this program is very, very expensive.  It's consuming ever larger  amount of the\noverall budget -- not only Department of the Air Force,  of the across-the-board tac air program,\nand that likewise concerns  me. WARNER:  Let's go to Admiral and the JAST -- have you had a  chance to look at the Time's\narticle? STEIDLE:  Yes, sir. WARNER:  And are there areas in which you feel that you would  like to put information,\ncomments... STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, I would. WARNER:  ...otherwise in the record?  Fine. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, I would. WARNER:  Because it's an important piece, and I want to make sure  that our record reflects\nany thoughts you have. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  I think Mr. Shannon  did an outstanding  job on the article in total, sir. WARNER:  Did he interview you, by any chance? STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, he did. WARNER:  Well, that's why it's outstanding then. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  There was one area that he linked... WARNER:  Why don't you teach us politicians how you... STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  He had linked me to the $750 billion  estimate that he had, and I, in fact,\nwent back to him after the  session that we had and said, I cannot add my numbers up to get to \nthat particular figure. Mr. Blackwell  from Lockheed mentioned a trillion dollar  program and a\nWall Street analyst recommended a $750 billion.  They  are probably -- they have more\nexperience in this particular field  than I have, but 3,000 airplanes at $30 million a copy comes\nout to  $90 billion, and this is an order of magnitude above that.  So I told  him I had difficulty\nwith that particular figure. Another area was -- in the article here, I just noticed and I'm  sorry I\ndidn't the first time I read this -- airplanes will roll out  in 2005.  That's true of the test articles. \nThe first operational  airplane will be available in 2008. And the third piece that he brings in is\nthe fact that --  alluding to the fact that perhaps the Navy would possibly in the  future not\nsupport the program as strongly as the other services.  I  think -- I disagree with that. Admiral\nBoorda has told me several times that he fully supports  this and needs the aircraft, and the Navy\nis fully behind it.  Other than that, sir, I think it's on target. WARNER:  All right.  Let's address then the funding profile --  $131 million in fiscal '96. \nThat was -- excuse me -- that was a cut  of $131 million off a baseline of what figure? STEIDLE:  Approximately $331, sir.  It brought us down to about  $200 million in '96. WARNER:  Those figures -- you're going to stick with them? STEIDLE:  I'm going to refine them in just a second, sir. WARNER:  All right. STEIDLE:  I'll give you the exact figures there within plus or  minus two or three million, sir. WARNER:  You know, while he's getting to the figures, I have to  recount when I used to\ntestify as Secretary of the Navy, we would  literally have two dolly carts full of records behind\nus.  And now I  guess with the modern computer and brighter officers, we're able to to  it with a\nhandful of papers. STEIDLE:  Or submit a lot for the record. Sir, the exact figures... WARNER:  All right. STEIDLE:  I'm sorry, we started out with $345 million and went to  $206 million. WARNER:  Before -- OK, tell us what was the impact of that cut,  then.  Those are some\nfairly hefty bucks. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  If I could just step back for just a second  from where the program\nstarted.  It started in the Bottoms-Up Review  in '93.  At that particular time, the AFX program\nand the multi-roller  fighter airplane were cancelled, were rolled into one in this  particular\nprogram. Mr. Deutch in August of that year established a program with a  memorandum and laid in a\nwedge at that particular time in '93 for the  program.  Since that particular time, we've merged the\nA-STOVL  program into it.  We've gone from a technology demonstration to an  actual strike\nfighter program and the wedge stayed in the same shape.  And that's not appropriate for a\nDEM-VAL or development program.  You  need up front funds and the shape of the curve\nshould be a bell-curve  skewed to the left. I went forward in August and July of last year with redefining  the program as we put some\nmore substance on it.  Went forward and  then came on over here to several of the staffs in late\nAugust or  September time frame, after it had gone past your particular committee  with this new\nfunding profile.  I presented a profile that was going  to use '96 funding to be able to do work in\n'97.  That funding was  quickly removed and the statement was put in that that funding should  be\napplied in '97.  That was two year money.  We could do that. The services came forward with a program decision memorandum in  September fully funding\nthe program to the new DEM-VAL profile that  we're executing today. So, in answer to your\nquestion, sir, the bottom line is we  reshaped the program and we have the money in the right\nyear and the  funding profile was correct to execute. WARNER:  What time sequence was it adjusted? STEIDLE:  We moved the program four months to the right.  I  looked at some tech\nmaturation programs that we're doing.  We moved  those in the out years.  We looked for\nredundancies and shelved a few  of those particular programs.  Moved the end point out four\nmonths.  And the total program was then reshaped and moved to the right  slightly. WARNER:  I may return to that program, but I'll have a question  for Admiral McGinn and\nthen refer to my colleague.  The old EA-6B --  what a workhorse. MCGINN:  Yes, sir. WARNER:  I think the taxpayers got their money's worth out of  that plane, wouldn't you\nsay? MCGINN:  They continue to get it Senator. WARNER:  No question about it.  The committee has waited for some  time for the\ncompleted studies of Airborne Electronic Warfare  Requirements.  Despite DOD's\nunresponsiveness, last year's Defense  authorization bill included generous funding for the\nelectronic  warfare upgrades and modifications.  The committee's concerned that  delays in\nmaking substantial upgrades EA-6B will prevent the Navy from  capitalizing on prior investing\nin the advance capability, that's the  ADV cap.  Is the Navy now ready to move out on this\nprogram and make  it a substantial commitment to near term EW capability? STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, we are.  We continued to wisely use the funds  that Congress provided\nlast year, the $165 million.  We spent 100  million of that dollars -- or we are spending 100\nmillion of that  dollars in upgrading 20 aircraft to the block 89, the more modern  block 89\nconfiguration.  We spent an additional $40 million to get  what we call band nine and ten\nelectronic warfare transmitter pods.  And the final $25 million is going for 30 pods for\ncommunications  jamming. In addition to that, we have R&D programs that are ongoing to  address the idea of a reactive\njamming capability, something that you  can use against a variety of threats.  With the\nproliferation of First  World weapons systems throughout many, many different areas of  interest\nto the United States, we are concerned that we don't get so  stabilized and solidified in a\nparticular threat system that we can't  react agilely through additional threat systems that could be\nput  together with money by a nation with interests counter to ours.  So  the reactive jamming is\none answer to help us to be able to fly with  confidence into an enemy air defense system in any\nuncertain future. WARNER:  I'm going to ask General Magnus a question on JAST.  And  mister recorder, can\nyou put the general's response following Rear  Admiral Steidle's JAST comments so we've got\nthat one placed in the  record. General, is your invitation letter -- that is in our invitation  -- we asked you about the Marine\nCorps view of JAST program.  How  would you describe the relevance of that program to the\nfuture of the  Marine Corps aviation? MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, I'm glad that you asked me that question  because I had the\nopportunity this morning to speak to the commandant,  General Krulak, exactly on that topic. WARNER:  This morning? MAGNUS:  This morning, sir. WARNER:  You guys got off to a good, early start over there,  didn't you? MAGNUS:  Yes, sir.  As I've said, sir, readiness is your Corps.    The Marine Corps has made\nthe commitment in a real sense... WARNER:  You got a little sleep along the way, though, I served  in the Marines for many\nyears without any sleep, and I assure you that it helps. MAGNUS:  The Marine Corps has made the commitment in a very real  way to accept\nnear-term risk in our strike fire community, our AV-8B  Harriers and our F/A-18s.  We're putting\nour, literally our  investment, our money where our mouth is, and the technology leap that  we\nsee is in the joint strike fighter program. We believe that we and the nation, our wingmen in the Air Force  as well as our shipmates in\nthe Navy, urgently need the joint strike  fighter, and we believe from our perspective in the Corps\nthat now is  the time to take the incremental degree of risk, we think, with the  forces that we\nhave, looking at the threats that are in the next  decade, to take that leap to 2008 to the joint strike\nfighter. WARNER:  OK, so you're still on board. MAGNUS:  Yes, sir.  We're in the lead as far as our IOC  requirements, and we joined,\nwelded at the hip with the Air Force and  the Navy in the urgent need for this affordable,\nsurvivable family of  over 2800 joint aircraft. WARNER:  Thank you.  Senator Levin. LEVIN:  Just one question on the JAST program.  Admiral Steidle,  the press has reported\nrecently there's some problems with the release  of proprietary information to competing\ncontractors by the JAST  office.  Can you describe what has happened and whether this is a \nsignificant problem? STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  Well, there was, indeed, proprietary  information.  There was an\ninadvertent disclosure, unfortunately, at  the fax machine.  An enclosure to one particular letter\nwas put into  two other letters that went out to the competing contractors. So therefore certain pricing and costing information from one  contractor went to the other\ntwo.  The two particular contractors saw  that immediately, wrapped it up.  I sent my security\nofficer out there  after it.  We have statements to that effect, and we are providing  information to\nthe contractor whose information was sent. I hope to have it completely resolved by Wednesday\nand the  release of our RFP on Thursday of next week. WARNER:  Would you yield to me? LEVIN:  Sure. WARNER:  I -- at an appropriate time, if you're going to continue  with JAST. LEVIN:  No, I'm done with JAST. WARNER:  I think, Admiral Steidle, you should -- even those this  is a purple program that\nyou're operating -- what's the Navy's  perspective on JAST meeting its requirements in the out\nyear --  operational requirements? STEIDLE:  Sir, could I have Admiral McGinn that, sir? MCGINN:  Just as General Magnus stated, we are firmly onboard  with the JAST program,\nSenator.  Our need in terms of timing isn't as  urgent as the Marine Corps in the 2007, 2008\ntimeframe. But we have a road map to the future that involves going from  where we are today\nwith the types of aircraft and our air wings, using  the significant increase in capability of the\nF-18EF and then blending  that in a complementary way with JAST when it comes onboard\nNavy  aircraft carriers in about the 2010 to 2012 timeframe -- about three  to four years after the\nMarine Corps. WARNER:  General Eberhart, for the Department of the Air Force... EBERHART:  Yes, sir. WARNER:  Is it likewise your... EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  It would sound like a recording.  We're  completely behind it, and we\nare.  It's key to the Air Force of the  future. WARNER:  And in all, then, this joint program is working out  well?  As a matter of fact, I\nthink your deputy, Admiral Steidle, is a  BG selectee? STEIDLE:  Yes, sir, he is.  Yes, sir, the Air Force's newest  general, sir. WARNER:  Good.  That's fine. STEIDLE:  If he doesn't mess up JAST. WARNER:  So we don't know whether you're really a general for  about 10, 15 more years\nthen? Only thing I can tell you, colonel, general or whatever the case  may be -- I knew General\nEberhart when he was a major.  So somehow  he's made it, despite his association with members\nof Congress.  All right.  Excuse me, thank you.  Colleague, I'd like to get  that one JAST thing in\nthe record altogether. LEVIN:  Well, the follow-up on that JAST question would be you  say that the competitor\nwhose proprietary information was  inadvertently disclosed has now been informed of that? STEIDLE:  He has been informed, sir.  And I will go down on  Wednesday of next week and\npresent our investigation to them.  That  particular contractor issued a agency protest -- rightfully\nso, in my  mind. STEIDLE:  I will present all the information to him, and tell him  what our investigation in\nimpact of the disclosure of that material  has. LEVIN:  So, we really don't know yet what the effect is going to  be.  It's not been resolved\nyet? STEIDLE:  No, sir, it is not.  No, sir, it is not.  By Wednesday  I'll have it finished. LEVIN:  If you'd let us know the outcome of that for the record,  it would be helpful. STEIDLE:  Wilco.  Yes, sir. WARNER:  Just as a follow-on, Senator.  Your program has recently  progressed from\nconcept exploration into the requirements generation  and validation process.  What will be the\ncritical two or three events  between now and the award of the EMD to produce test aircraft? \nWhat  has to go right, what could go wrong? STEIDLE:  Yes, sir.  We're starting... WARNER:  Great staff question. STEIDLE:  Yes, sir. STEIDLE:  We're doing business differently, Senator.  We  have this group of\ncost/performance trades.  It's never been done  at that level before. Industry is a full partner of\nthis.  We  are trading off the requirements base that each one of the  services have allowed us a\nlarge envelope to work in as we pull  it down. Moving into the development phase, we'll award the two contracts  to the two teams.  They\nwill have to demonstrate their ability to  build this airplane with a high level of commonality,\nwhich  significantly reduces the cost, demonstrate hover in transition,  demonstrate carrier\nsuitable flying quality, and continue on with the  ground demonstration of technology\nmaturation.  We need to mature the  technologies before we go into the EMD program.  That'll be\ndone. And our ORD will be completely finished by the year '99.  And  that's a process in itself that\nis being done in the virtual world in  modeling and simulation.  So it's a significant change from\nthe way we  have done business in the past. LEVIN:  Let me get to the data link issue on the fighter  aircraft, general.  Apparently, getting\ntactical data links into the  fighters has been a difficult issue for the Air Force for a number of \nyears.  Some have the perception that the Air Force has resisted  adding that capability, not just\nbecause of cost but because of  cultural barriers.  I'm convinced that the added situational aware \nthat sharing the data among various platforms would provide has  tremendous potential for us. Are there fighter data links included in the com-links that the  chief of staff has added to his\nlist, do you know? EBERHART:  Yes, sir, there are. LEVIN:  And is the... EBERHART:  It's under the guise of sensor shooter, and under  that... LEVIN:  Would you just say that again? EBERHART:  It's under the title sensor to shooter, and under that  are the things that you're so\nconcerned of and so are we.  And you're  spot on, it was a cultural problem for a while, and in my\nview we  might have hid behind the money issue.  We're committed now, we  realize how\nimportant it is to joint war fighting, and we're moving  ahead. LEVIN:  All right.  And General Magnus, is the Marines committed  to also adopt that\ncapability? MAGNUS:  Senator, we are.  We, of course, field our aircraft in a  common long-range plan\nwith the United States Navy and a program that  is unique to us, having taken over the Advanced\nTechnical Air  Reconnaissance System.   For example, we have added a data link pod to  that\nsystem so that when it is fielded it will not only give us the  capability to download the\nreconnaissance when we get to the ground,  but will be able to give near real time bursts of that\ncritical  tactical battlefield information to joint force commanders and forces  at sea. LEVIN:  OK.  Admiral McGinn do you want to add anything to that? MCGINN:  Yes, sir.  We are already flying in many of our aircraft  including the F-14 D, the\nJ-TDS, or LINK-16, which we have found  provides tremendously increased situational\nawareness and it allows  aircraft in a particular strike package or fighter sweep to coordinate \ntheir efforts in a much better way than we've ever been able to do  before. I'd like to also say that a Marine program that offers a great  deal of promise that has been\nfielded and prototyped is a  digitalization called Automatic Target Hand-Off System which\nallows a  Marine on the ground under fire to digitally communicate right into  the aircraft\nweapons system, in this case the AV-8B, but it will --  we're looking to field it in all of our\nFA-18s as well.  You know,  actually put the symbol of the target that the Marine Lance Corporal \nin the trenches wants to hit, needs to hit, right on the heads-up  display of the fighter aircraft or\nthe AV-8B.  And it is a tremendous  leap forward in close air support capability for the future. \nAnd  General Magnus might want to comment further on that, sir. MAGNUS:  And I appreciate the comments of my shipmate, Admiral  McGinn, the\nAutomatic Target Hand-Off System because exactly right,  our forward observers, forward air\ncontrollers on the ground will be  able to take the standard 9 line immediate air support request\nand  beam it up via data link just as the Admiral said, so the pilot in a  strike aircraft that is line\nof sight, but out of visual range will be  able to stand off from the threat, receive the information\nand roll in  on the target. Coupling that capability with the emerging 1760 BUS digital  capability\nin weapons like JDAM and JSOW, we are literally going to be  able to deliver close air support\nto troops on the ground at night  through the weather in the future with precision, accuracy,\nbecause of  the capability to pass that information up and then load it down into  the weapons. LEVIN:  Are we funding that program as much as we -- in a robust  way, we, in this budget? MCGINN:  I'd love to get an answer for you for the record Senator  on that. LEVIN:  And General, I take it from your answer that the Air  Force is now committed to\nhaving the same kind of reliance on the  tactical data links in it's fighter aircraft as we've just\nheard  described by the Navy and the Marines. EBERHART:  Yes, sir, to put a little more bluntly but you  referenced it earlier.  We're over\nour cultural problem that we had.  And then to take it one step further, exactly what they just \ndiscussed, this interface between the digitalization of the ground  battle and the air battle is key. \nIn the past when we did look at it,  we looked at it more of just digitalization of the air, and data\nlink  in the air.  And working that together is how we really become  efficient.  And then, oh, by\nthe way, reduce fratricide. LEVIN:  Well, it's good news to hear your testimony this morning,  and the budget numbers\nwill be helpful if you'll submit those. EBERHART:  Yes, sir. LEVIN:  Because that -- that's an area of top priority for this  committee and has been for a\nnumber of years. WARNER:  General Magnus, would you please pass on to your senior  chief of aviation our\nbest wishes for a speedy recovery from his  operation and so forth? MAGNUS:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  General Blot is recovering  well.  He has had\nshoulder surgery, for your information.  And the  reason why he's not here is obviously he's fairly\nuncomfortable --  doing very well but couldn't get into his uniform.  So he sent me to  speak to\nyou this morning. WARNER:  Glad to have you. Let's talk about your CV-22 and the problems that have been \nexpressed by the retiring chief of the U.S. special operations  command.  What do you have to\nenlighten us on that?  Have you read that article?  If not, I'll send it up so  you can skim it for a\nminute. MAGNUS:  I'm not sure which article to which you're referring --  although there have been\nseveral that I've read in the last few days. WARNER:  Well, let's work off the the same baseline, and I'll go  to another question. MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, I am familiar with this article. WARNER:  Well, why don't you go ahead then? MAGNUS:  The joint V-22 program, I believe, is a success story,  and of course like many\nother large programs that are in engineering  and manufacturing development we're constantly\nchallenged by  constrained fiscal resources. When the Department of Defense had a defense acquisition board  and a defense resources\nboard in 1994 joining the U.S. Air Force  Special Operations Command requirement for a special\noperations force  CV-22 to the Marine Corps MV-22, the estimate for the development of  the\nCV-22 -- the U.S. Special Operations Command variant -- was $550  million. And that estimate came from the United States Air Force, I  believe it was Aeronautical\nSystems Command.  Subsequent to that, the  Department of the Navy committed, with\nDepartment of the Navy RDT&E  money, to fund that $550 million profile that we believed\nwould be  adequate to provide to take the MV-22 baseline aircraft into a Special  Operations\nvariant. In the succeeding two years, Special Operations Command has  defined its configuration\nmuch more finely than they had in '94.  We  -- the program office and Naval Air Systems\nCommand submitted a  request for a proposal for the development effort to the Bell-Boeing  joint\nteam. And essentially, the response from the contractors came in at  approximately $200 million\nover what was allocated in the budget.  Clearly, that presented more than a minor challenge\nbecause we did not  have, in the Department of the Navy, that additional $200 million. And something had to move, and we certainly recognized the  Special Operations Command\nrequirements as well as their need for a  fiscal year 2005 IOC. There have been a number of meetings between the Assistant  Secretary of the Navy for\nResearch and Development, Mr. Douglas, and  the U.S. Special Operations Command\nrepresentatives on alternatives in  which we believe there are more than one alternative and\nwhich within  the Navy's commitment to the $550 million we can -- with ideas such as \npreplanned product improvement -- provide exactly the kind of aircraft  that Special Operations\nCommand and our Air Force wing men need to be  able to accomplish their critical mission. MAGNUS:  There are ongoing discussions between Special Operations  Command and the\nUnited States Navy.  OSD has been involved in the  overarching team that is watching this\nprogram closely.  And we have  been, of course, in consultation with our Air Force wingmen.\nWe believe there are more than one solution that will allow us to  execute to our $550 million\ncommitment and provide the Air Force  Special Operations Command the aircraft that they need\nwhen they need  it. WARNER:  That's reassuring and Douglas is a very able man,  trained here by this\ncommission, and I have a high degree of  confidence, as do other members. Do you want to take a question or I'll... LEVIN:  Just on the V-22 issue.  There have been some, another  press report relating to\ntesting results on the V-22 which indicates  some problems, unacceptable level of down draft or\nprop wash below the  aircraft operating, when it operates at hover.  Is there going to be  an\nopportunity during the operational testing to determine whether or  not that condition is real. MAGNUS:  Senator, thank you very much for that question.  We have  been aware -- and I\nsay we in a personal sense -- have been aware of  the down wash effect of tilt rotors, not only\nfrom our experience with  high velocity down wash aircraft such as V-stal , but when I was a \nmajor I was on the joint NASA-Army-Navy-Air Force and Industry team  that went out to NASA\nAmes and modeled the aircraft that was then  being designed call JVX, which has since become\nthe V-22 Osprey tilt  rotor. We were well aware that the velocity and the footprint, if you  will, of the air that is moving\ndown was going to be more than we have  in the current medium helicopters, but, quite frankly,\ncomparable to  heavy lift helicopters, such as the CH-53 Echo; different, but  comparable to it. In other words, that we knew that people who were operating in  the vicinity underneath the\naircraft would have a high velocity down  wash.  And we anticipated this, so this is not a\nsurprise. As a result of that, during our operational tests we have just  completed operation test\n2B, which focused specifically on this issue.  We better understand how ground combat marines,\nsailors and soldiers  will operate under aircraft that are being flown by Air Force, Navy  and\nMarine Corps pilots, and we believe, and I have personally read  the comments of marine\nhelicopter support team members, lance  corporals who have worked under these aircraft, who\nbasically say it  is comparable to their CH-53 Echo experience. What I can tell you is, just like the CH-53 Echo, which went  through it op eval in 1979, and\nthere were words in the report there  that described it as dangerous and requiring special\nequipment that we  didn't have in 1979, we will find tactics, techniques and procedures  that will\nallow us to safely and effectively utilize this aircraft.  We have anticipated this problem and we\nare working with our  joint wingmen on this as well as the people who will actually be the  real\ncustomers of the aircraft, and that's the troops that'll be in  the back.  I'm confident that this will\nbe resolved. LEVIN:  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. WARNER:  This is a question to all three.  We'll ask General  Eberhart, Admiral McGinn and\nGeneral Magnus to answer. WARNER:  Over the years, the committee has taken an active  interest in airborne.  Part of\nthis has been addressed, but the  senator and I want to make sure that there is nothing left in this \nuntouched. The committee has taken an active interest in airborne electronic  warfare.  An\ninitiative by the committee a few years ago was  encouraged by the Defense Department to\nconsolidate airborne EW into  one program and to adequately fund that program. Today we have\nan aged EA-6B fleet which -- with much the same  capability as in the years past, while the threat\nexpands and becomes  more sophisticated.  At the same time, the Air Force plans to retire \nEF-111. What is the importance of airborne electronic warfare to your  tactical aviation program? \nWhat near-term capabilities do you have to  address that threat, General, to the extent you haven't\ncovered it  already? EBERHART:  Yes, sir.  Obviously, airborne ECM is very important  to our program and the\nsurvival of our pilots and our effectiveness on  the battlefield. We support the efforts that are ongoing to build the EA-6B fleet  up, make improvements to\nit, to provide for our joint ECM  requirements.  We're part of the solution there, and not part of\nthe  problem.  We're committed to it. However, at the same time, I have to tell you that we have an  insurance policy there in that as\nwe draw down the EF-111s, we keep  them around till the -- the number's classified -- but\nsometime in  '98.  We can an increased crew-to-aircraft ratio, and the airplanes  that we do retire\nwe don't take the date as moth them, we leave on  the ramp. So if there is a hiccough or we have a requirement, then we can  fall back on it.  But we're\ncommitted to it.  We want it to work.  We  know it's the right thing to do. You know, and the committee knows as well as I do, that we have  to approach this problem\nfrom many different ways.  In addition to  airborne ECM, if we have better battlespace awareness\nin terms of  increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance so we know  where the\nthreats are, we know what the threats can do, we know how to  either attack them or avoid them,\nusing Stealth and using PGM. We also have the nonlethal part of this, and eventually some day  we think there will be\ninformation warfare ways to get in and help us  survive in the battlefield of the future.  And we\nthink it's important  to work all of these aspects, and that's what we're committed to. WARNER:  Admiral McGinn? MCGINN:  I fully concur with General Eberhart's remarks, Senator,  and I'd like to just add a\nfew of my own.  The EA-6B is, as mature an  airframe and engine combination as\n it is, still enjoys a great deal of  service life that is available to it. We have an active and ongoing operational safety improvement  program that is closely\nmonitored by engineers and air crewmen and  maintenance personnel in the field as well as at the\nvarious systems  commands. It is a truly joint program in that later this month, the three  service\nchiefs will sign a memorandum of agreement that will solidify  the progress that we have made\nin making the EA-6B fleet truly the  nation's tactical EW force. I received a report from the wing\ncommander -- the EA-6B wing  commander -- two weeks ago as well as one of the EA-6B\nsquadron COs  who had just returned from deployment over in the Mediterranean.  They  are\nabsolutely confident that the program is on track. It is properly resourced in terms of airframes,\nthe equipment  upgrades that are going in now and are planned, as well as the air  crew upgrades\nas well. We have Air Force air crews flying in EA-6Bs in training as well  as in operations, and\nthey have also coordinated at the EA-6B wing  level with all of the services and all of the unified\ncommanders in  chiefs and their staffs to make sure that the global coverage exists  in terms of\nforward presence as well as a very responsive reaction  capability should that be required in any\ntype of a regional  contingency. WARNER:  General. MAGNUS:  Mr. Chairman, I agree with the remarks of General  Eberhart and Admiral\nMcGinn.  The Marine Corps, as you know, has four  squadrons of prowlers in the ICAP-2\nconfiguration.  We along with the  Navy are operating our aircraft to the Block-89 Alpha\nconfiguration. As I told you earlier in the hearing, Marines are on the ground  today in Aviano and earlier\nlast year when there was the need to bring  additional tactical aircraft into the theaters to support\nstrikes that  were needed on the ground, Marine squadrons deployed within 48 hours  and was\nflying combat missions on the third day from the time that  they got the to order from the Joint\nChiefs of Staffs. We were integrated with the Navy in carrier deployments as well  as basing out of our base at\nIwakuni, Japan.  We will support the  United States Navy in fulfilling our important\nresponsibilities in the  Department of the Navy to provide aircraft not only for our own  support\nrequirements but to support the United Sates Air Force and our  allies. Of course, the United States Navy has received a budgetary FYSYP  up and some structure to\ntake up the Air Force's EF-111 mission as  those aircraft stand down.  Nevertheless, and\nconsistent with the  tactical aviation integration memorandum of agreement that the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps and the Chief of Naval Operations have  in general about all\nof our strike and electronic warfare aircraft, we  will support the United States Navy in fulfilling\nour commitments to  the nation. WARNER:  Senator Levin.  Gentlemen, I'm going to  have to absent  myself and my\ndistinguished colleague will wrap up the hearing.  Thank  you very much. LEVIN:  General, I want to talk to you about F-16s for a minute.  We've got a new definition\nof service life of the F-16s which is now  driving us to purchase some additional F-16s.  And\nthere's a real  question about whether that's the right way to go given our other  needs in the Air\nForce.  But let me try to work through this number  with you.   We have a 20 wing fighter force\nnow and I gather the  portion of that force that is made of F-16s is somewhat more than  half.  Do\nyou know off hand if that's correct? EBERHART:  Sir, that sounds correct.  I'll get the number here as  you... LEVIN:  OK, well, than maybe I better get these numbers for the  record. EBERHART:  Yes, sir. LEVIN:  Let me tell you what I need, because you may not have  them at your fingertips. \nWhat I need to know is what was the F-16  requirement when we had a 26-wing force, what was\nthe F-16 requirement  now, what would it have been had we gone to a 36-wing force, which was \nthe goal during the early '90s? Those three items I need and how many F-16s would have made up  those three different\nforce structures.  Then I need you to translate  that into both the old definition and the new\ndefinition of service  life in terms of how many available F-16s we got.  And that's  something\nyou can provide us for the record. EBERHART:  Yes, sir. LEVIN:  Do you know in general whether or not the number of F-16  fighter wing\nequivalence has changed over the recent past?  Do you  know that offhand? EBERHART:  Sir, it is changed, obviously, as we've drawn down  some F-16s, and we can\nthink of wings like the 474th at Nellis and  other wings that have drawn down.  And as airplanes\nhave aged, it's  certainly changed, although the other fighter force structure is  changed, too. So I don't have on the tip of my tongue what the relationship in  terms of proportion of force\nis in terms of change, but we'd like to  show that to you for the record and the proportion of the\ndifferent  blocks, how they've changed... LEVIN:  All right. EBERHART:  ...because that's what complicates this issue, as you  know. LEVIN:  Right.  That's fine.  Are you familiar with the Coalition  Force Enhancement\nProgram?  Does that strike a bell? EBERHART:  I think I...no, sir. LEVIN:  OK.  This was a program that would have given the F-16s  some improved\ncapability, upgraded them, added some service life.  And  we can find that in a different way. EBERHART:  Yes, sir, I am familiar with that program. LEVIN:  OK.  Was it our plan to use that program and sell those  upgraded F-16 to our allies? EBERHART:  Sir, our hope was to do just that and then have a  device or a procedure where\nthat money is supposed to be returned to  the Treasury would be returned to the United States Air\nForce to buy  these attrition reserve airplanes that we've just discussed. LEVIN:  Do you know the cost of adding 4000 hours of service life  to a plane under that\nprogram? EBERHART:  No, sir, I do not know.  One of our big problems right  now is that as we've\nlooked around on this and how much we would have  to sell those for, I think the brutal facts are\nthere are no buyers. LEVIN:  They want to... EBERHART:  Just as soon have a new airplane. LEVIN:  All right.  Now, are you familiar with the JSTARS budget  request in the current\nbudget? EBERHART:  Yes, sir. LEVIN:  As I understand it, the budget would cut the JSTARS  procurement in half during\nfiscal years '99, 2000, and 2001, buying  one instead of two during those fiscal years? EBERHART:  Sir, my recollection was that we did, in fact, move  one airplane right.  I wasn't\naware that we moved three right.  I  thought we moved one right.  I'll have to provide that for the\nrecord. LEVIN:  Can you tell us what the experience with the J-STARS was  in the Persian Gulf War,\nin Bosnia? LEVIN:  Are the CINCs interested in more JSTARS? EBERHART:  Sir, the CINCs are very interested in the JSTARS  program as it exists today\nand the planned improvements as we get on  through the production line. Obviously, as you know, the bird that we have today and the  production birds will be much\nmore capable than the bird that we had  in the Persian Gulf.  And that -- we were all amazed by\nwhat it was  able to do in such short notice. I think that in Bosnia today, people are impressed with what it's  doing, although it's a\ndifferent situation because of the topography,  we don't have a pool table, if you will, like we had\nin Desert Storm  or like we imagined in the central region of Europe. But we have tools where we can go and take this and show the CINC  that if you bring\nJSTARS here and you put it in this orbit, this is  what you're going to be able to see around\nSarajevo.  This is what  you're not going to be able to see.  So that the expectations are  there and\nhe fully understands what this tool will bring to him as a  CINC. And that's exactly what we did\nbefore we deployed JSTARS, so it's  living up to the expectations, and it's allowing us to use it in\nways  in peacekeeping and peace making that we hadn't envisioned using in a  major regional\ncontingency. So everybody's very impressed with what they see in terms of  JSTARS now.  And\nfrankly, the move right was an affordability issue to  make sure that everything would fit. LEVIN:  Well, that's what troubles me is that we've got a new  technology and a new\nplatform, which is working extremely well from  everything we can learn, and we're moving that\nto the right for  affordability reasons. And then, we're spending money buying F-16s and F-15s for  attrition reserves, which are\nonly created by the changing the program  life expectancy of planes.  And where planes could be\nupgrades quite  easily, as a matter of fact, if necessary in order to extend that  program life. I mean, it just seems to me there's a disconnect here where we've  got a real need of a new\ntechnology that is proving itself every day  in Bosnia and has proven itself in -- over many, many\nmonths in the  Persian Gulf, and that we're delaying and using money to create a  reserve which\nreally, it seems to me, is not a realistic need when you  consider the fact that we've reduced the\nnumber quite dramatically of  how many F-16s we're going to need because of the reduction in\nfighter  wings. So, to me, it's a priority which is misplaced, but I'm not asking  you to agree or disagree with\nthat so much as I need from you for the  record the history of the F-16s when we had 26 fighter\nwings.  Now  that it's down to 20 what would have been had we -- the requirement --  what the\nrequirement would have been had we gone up to 35?  The impact on the -- on that requirement\nwhen we changed the  service life expectancy of the F-16 and then we can put all that  together\nand reach our own conclusion.  But at least that's certainly  my tentative conclusion. EBERHART:  Sir, we'll certainly provide that and the chief shares  your concerns there. \nMaybe not necessarily versus the F-16 but the  importance of that JSTARS and we are relooking\nthat now as we build  the '98 to '03 program. LEVIN:  OK.  Thank you.  And then my last question, General  Magnus, has to do with the\nC130-J aircraft, and I understand that  you'd like to begin buying a tanker version of that aircraft.\nIs that  correct? MAGNUS:  Senator, our current active force has 37 35 year old  KC130-Fs and an additional\n14 slightly younger KC130-Rs.  Based upon  what our projection of the service life of those\naircraft are,  unfortunately the bulk of them are going to come due for block service  life\nretirement just exactly when we need to invest in aircraft like  the joint strike fighter and V-22\nand the Navy's F/A-18EF.  We have been monitoring the United States Air Forces C130-J \nprogram.  We are enormously impressed with the improvements in the  cockpits and the avionics\nin the performance of the air craft.  We  believe it would be prudent for us to be able to\nessentially piggy  back on that program.  Fiscal resource constraints have not enabled us  to do\nthat at this time. LEVIN:  Now you just completed, did you not, the modernization of  your tactical tankers a\ncouple of years ago? MAGNUS:  That's correct.  We still have some other things that  are being modernized in\nterms of radios, global position, satellite  com.  So, there is a continuing strain, but essentially\nthat is  correct. LEVIN:  And despite that recent completion of that modernization  program, you want to start\nbuying some new tankers for reasons that  you gave? MAGNUS:  Well, essentially the modernization that we're talking  about, that the Senator is\nreferring to, is sub-systems.  Our concern  is service life, fatigue life of the aircraft.  These\naircraft are 35  years old.  We would have to spend an enormous amount more money to \nbasically do a service life extension on these aircraft when we have  aircraft that are being\nproduced for the United States Air Force.  They're going to have very low ownership costs, just\nas ours are  spiking. So, we believe it prudent not to invest in schlepping old  aircraft when in fact they're going to\nbe very cost effective in terms  of life cycle costs and commonality.  Very cost effective --\nC130-Js  being produced for our wing men in the United States Air Force. So we look forward to\nbeing able to take advantage of that  program. LEVIN:  Thank you all.  Appreciate your testimony.   We will  stand adjourned."
