You can employ someone yourself, or purchase services from a third party, or other agency. Social services must be sure that you are able to manage direct payments. They should help you to get any support you need – such as with keeping records or managing paperwork. If you employ your own care worker, you might also need advice about meeting your responsibilities as an employer.

Only by hearing people's comments can councils improve their services. Your comments might benefit other blind and partially sighted people. Most complaints can be dealt with informally, by talking to the person who is responsible for providing the service. However, if you are not satisfied you can make a formal complaint. The council should help you to put your complaint in writing. If you make a formal complaint, the council must investigate this and provide a written response within 28 days. If you are still not happy, you can ask for your complaint to be put before an independent review panel. To prepare for a review panel, you can ask the council for help in getting access to your social work files and in finding someone to represent you, if necessary. You can also ask your local councillor for support in making your complaint. We recommend that you seek expert legal advice if you are still not satisfied and want to take matters further."
