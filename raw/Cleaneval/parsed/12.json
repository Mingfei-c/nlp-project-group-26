      "text": "TEACHER \r\n  READING Clement, Lynne, \"Revising & Editing,\" 1991, rev. 2000. A brief sheet that discusses the differences between revising and editing and \r\n  gives teachers tips on dealing with groups of students when conducting these \r\n  activities. It stresses the importance of revising student work for content \r\n  and meaning, before giving any attention to the mechanics. Quick to read, but \r\n  worthwhile. Hansen, Jane, When Writers Read , Chapter 12; Heineman, 1985. This article gives teachers some information on the connections between reading \r\n  and writing and how to capitalize on them for success in writing instruction. \r\n  It focuses on skills instruction, reasons for it, how to implement it, and what \r\n  to keep in mind as classes are conducted. Jenkinson, Edward B., \"Learning to Write/Writing to Learn,\" Phi Delta Kappan, 1988. This article will give teachers some background on the difference between the \r\n  two activities mentioned in the title and the importance of both for their students. \r\n  \"For thousands of students, writing is like trying to run through a minefield \r\n  strewn with run-on sentences, misspellings, dangling modifiers, and trite expressions. \r\n  A successful crossing is a rare experience, according to Mr. Jenkinson, who \r\n  argues that writing should serve instead as a powerful catalyst for learning.\" The \r\n  National Writing Project http://www-gse.berkeley.edu/Research/NWP/nwp.html The homepage of the mother of all writing projects. It is the oldest and most \r\n  widely respected project to train teachers to teach writing across the curriculum. \r\n  It leads to all kinds of local writing projects and training opportunities. Purdue \r\n  University's Online Writing Lab http://owl.english.purdue.edu/ This site includes basics for teachers and students. There is a resource section \r\n  that includes 130 instructional handouts! Teachers should definitely have a \r\n  look at the \"Resources for Teachers\" section's \"Materials for \r\n  teaching writing in any discipline.\" It includes a great guide for developing \r\n  assignments. Strauss, Valerie, For \r\n  Students, No Dodging the Drafts , Washington Post, May 23, 2000 http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A51803-2000May22.html An article from The Washington Post that discusses a new emphasis on \r\n  peer review and editing in the elementary classroom. Viadero, Debra, Technical \r\n  Difficulties , Education Week, May 17, 2000 An essay from Education Week that discusses writing assessment from a variety \r\n  of angles."
