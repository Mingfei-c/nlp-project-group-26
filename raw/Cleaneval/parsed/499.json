This workshop provided an introduction to drawing for design, focusing \r        on rapid visualization and perspective sketching techniques. IDSA Book Club - John Heskett's Toothpicks and Logos March 18 @ 6:30 PM led by Paul Hatch of TEAMS Design TEAMS Design 1812 West Hubbard St, # 3A Chicago, IL 60622 www.teamsdesign.com Originally planned for December 2002, this book club review has been \r          rescheduled once again for March 18th. It turns out the only two times \r          we’ve gotten any real snow this winter have been the days book \r          club was scheduled. We’ll, we’ve decided to give this book \r          one more chance. So, please come out and join us for some lively chat \r          at TEAMS new location. Note: Book Club is looking for their next book to review. If you have \r          a book you’ve recently enjoyed, please bring it along for discussion. \r          All are welcome. After the previous books were wide-ranging in scope, it's time now \r          for us to take an introspective look at our own profession with John \r          Heskett's new book Toothpicks and Logos . The author of the 1981 \r          book \"Industrial Design\" (an essential item on every self-respecting \r          industrial designer's bookshelf) he now succeeds to define industrial \r          design by reflecting it against modern contexts such as cultural, technological, \r          environmental and corporate influences. \"Design is one of the basic characteristics of what it is to be \r          human, and an essential determinant of the quality of human life.\" \r          - a principle that nurtures his book as much as our profession. If you don't make it there, then book is also available on-line at \r          Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/stores/detail/-/books/0192803212/reviews/103-5395707-6548649#01928032125000 IDSA Modelmaking Workshop: \"Model Thoughts\" Hosted by Tim Copeland, IDSA, Podd Morrow Design Columbia College Thursday March 27th- 6:30-8:30 pm. 623 S.

Book Club - The Overspent American by Juliet Shor Date: May 20 Time: 6:30-? Location: Wishbone, Lincoln Ave. Subject: The Overspent American by Juliet Shor http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060977582/qid=1049992284/sr=2-1/103-3779327-3853430?v=glance&s=books Chicago Fight Club June 26 at Teams Design 1812 West Hubbard St. 7 pm Building on the success of the Book Club, the Chicago chapter is setting \r          up a new social event for Chicago Designers. Paul Hatch: \"We found \r          that the chief attraction of the Book Club is the social aspect of the \r          meeting, which typically only briefly focuses on the chosen book. Discourse \r          then ran the full gambit of topics.\" Fight Club is a more targeted discussion, around a chosen topic of \r          debate such as a film, TV show or current exhibition. The first meeting \r          will be centered on the film Matrix Reloaded. Here, two volunteers will \r          take extreme pro and contra angles to debate the merits and pitfalls \r          of the film, the actors, and the genre. Everyone else can add their \r          spice to the debate on either side. First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules. Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner. Being able to articulate and defend your opinion is one of the most important skills a designer could have, and one that is rarely taught \r          in school. Join us on June 26 for the very first IDSA verbal slugfest.

After the success of the first Fight Club we knew there had to be a \r          follow up debate, so here it is: Sex and Violence . Most of Europe and Canada have less than 100 mortalities per year through \r          violence, whereas the US averages around 11,000 through guns alone. \r          The US has also cornered the market in its pornography business and \r          yet has one of the tightest restrictions on nudity on TV. Is it not \r          also contradictory to blur out partial nudity while we can watch decapitations \r          in full gory detail on primetime TV? This no-holds barred ‘street debate’ will cover these topics \r          and also discuss the effects sex & violence has on TV viewers, what \r          censorship does, etc. What is Fight Club? Picture this: – Two fighters under a spotlight, circled by 50 onlookers. – One subject matter, two radically opposing opinions. – Darkened empty loft space, multimedia backdrop. – Angry questions, careful answers, and heartfelt arguments. – One winner. Two volunteers -the fighters- take extreme for and against stances to \r          debate the merits and pitfalls of the subject. Everyone else adds their \r          spice to the debate on either side. First Rule of Fight Club: There are no debating rules. Second Rule of Fight Club: There can only be one winner. 2003 IDSA Chicago Chapter Holiday Party When: Thursday, December 4th 6:30 Cash bar 7:00 Dinner Where: Pasteur's 5525 North Broadway Chicago, IL http://www.swand7d.com/default.html French Vietnamese food that is highly recommended on Metromix, the\r          NY Times etc. RSVP by Nov 24: $30 members and dates $40 students and dates $50 non members At the door or received after Nov 24: $45 members and dates $55 students and dates $65 non members As always, we will be asking for a $10 gift / donation suitable for\r          a foster child between the ages of 10 months and 17 years old.
