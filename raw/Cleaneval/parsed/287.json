Always flying just under the radar by being available as take-out and at some deli counters, the appeal for Asian-inspired foods will propel mass production by manufacturers. Frozen meals and meal kits (perhaps in the refrigerated section because of the heavy veggie component) will be the first to show development."

In 2001 we saw 'mystery' ketchup colors, blue french fries, and, most recently, green pancake syrup from the Mrs Butterworth's brand. In essence, products that were already kid-friendly got more so. In 2002, however, we expect to find that kids are going to be the target for products that have been considered only to be appealing to the adult market. For example, coffee. Coffee drinkers are getting younger, and with the growing appeal of RTD iced coffees and the mammoth spread of Starbucks, we predict that there will soon be a kid-targeted coffee drink."

Getty Images available from Education Image Gallery Ten years ago, the newest fad was having your make up tattooed to your face. It never seemed to catch on, but it did highlight the desire women have for longer-lasting, no-mess cosmetics. We now have long-lasting lipsticks and a three-day wear last tint but the next area up for semi-permanence is fragrances. Potent, but not overpowering, scents will last until you take them off."

Perhaps juice-flavored milk packed with nutrients to replace a meal? A yogurt drink with fizz?"

Sprite held a Summer Liquid Mix Tour that offered entertainment, fashion, and music, SoBe sponsored the ESPN Rock 'N' Rip tour in early 2002, and we're all familiar with those popular Pepsi commercials and ads. We expect more of a musical tie-in with alcoholic beverages next year, as artists continue to incorporate them into their songs and videos. And with hip-hop mogul Jay-Z recently purchasing a brand of vodka, this prediction will prosper. Source: Adapted from Mintel, reproduced with permission.
