      "text": "Assuming the trial judge gives you the freedom to move around the courtroom, does it matter where and how you stand during direct and cross-examination? During direct examination, many lawyers recommend standing near the far end of the jury box, which forces the witness to look at the jury when answering. Is cross-examination any different? According to Steven Puiszis , President of the Illinois Association of Defense Trial Counsel , it's best to move around during cross-examination. That's according to Helen Gunnarsson's \"Cross-Examination: Beyond the Perry Mason Moment,\" in this month's Illinois Bar Journal -- Puiszis says that he paces around the courtroom during his cross-examination so that the witness will look at him and not at the jury. Doing so not only emphasized Puiszis's role as star but also further diminishes the witness's opportunity to gain credibility with the jury through eye contact. What's the \"role as star\" business? During cross-examination, the cross-examining lawyer should be the main focus of the jury's attention. It's the complete opposite of direct, when the witness plays only a supporting role. During cross-examination, the jury's attention should be squarely on the questioning lawyer, who asks leading questions to which the witness can only answer yes or no. To read Gunnarrson's entire article about cross-examination, look here (ISBA members only). December 21, 2006 in Cross-Examination , Direct Examination | Permalink | Comments (0) | TrackBack (0)"

Internet fax services like eFax can take care of the problem. For a modest fee, the company sends all your faxes to your email address as a pdf file. To do this, they'll also need to provide you with a new fax number, but you can simply set things up so that faxes to your current number are automatically forwarded to the new one. That way, you don't need to change your stationery.

      "text": "The Illinois Supreme Court has made a pdf file of the new amendments to the Illinois Supreme Court Rules available online. The amended rules are 40, 213, 316, and 527; some of the amendments are effective immediately, and some not until January 1. Litigators might be most interested in the amendments to Rule 213(g), which explain how an expert's trial testimony is circumscribed by the opinions disclosed in interrogatory answers and discovery depositions. The amendments are an attempt to make clear that an expert cannot disclose new opinions in an evidence deposition and then testify to those opinions live at trial. Opinions are to be disclosed before the evidence deposition, in an interrogatory response or a discovery deposition. The amended rule reads as follows, with the new amendments noted in italics: 213(g) Limitation on Testimony and Freedom to Cross-Examine. The information disclosed in answer to a Rule 213(f) interrogatory, or in a discovery deposition, limits the testimony that can be given by a witness on direct examination at trial . Information disclosed in a discovery deposition need not be later specifically identified in a Rule 213(f) answer, but, upon objection at trial, the burden is on the proponent of the witness to prove the information was provided in a Rule 213(f) answer or in the discovery deposition. Except upon a showing of good cause, information in an evidence deposition not previously disclosed in a Rule 213(f) interrogatory answer or in a discovery deposition shall not be admissible upon objection at trial . Without making disclosure under this rule, however, a cross-examining party can elicit information, including opinions, from the witness. This freedom to cross-examine is subject to a restriction that applies in actions that involve multiple parties and multiple representation. In such actions, the cross-examining party may not elicit undisclosed information, including opinions, from the witness on an issue on which its position is aligned with that of the party doing the direct examination.

    },
    {

      "text": "Juries in personal injury cases generally hear two versions of the medical facts, each presented by an opposing group of experts. If this isn't confusing enough, there's also testimony about the medical facts from the treating doctors, who may not agree with any of the experts. The treating doctors might disagree with each other too. How can you help the jury sort it out? If the better set of experts and treating physicians is on your side, emphasize this point with a chart that compares your doctors and experts to their doctors and experts. Here are some points of comparison you might use:"
    },
    {
      "tag": "div",
      "text": "Where the doctors went to medical school; The doctors' board certifications; The doctors' research interests; The doctors' publishing history; The doctors' teaching experience."
    },
    {
      "tag": "p",
      "text": "In closing, you can use the chart to point out that the most qualified doctors and experts support your view of the case. Example: \"You heard a lot in this case about a diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis, which was presented mostly through the testimony of Dr. Jones. Remember Dr. Jones? He's the doctor who said he's not yet board certified, though he's 'working on it.' Let's take a closer look at Dr. Jones--let's compare his credentials to those of Dr. Smith, who disagreed with him about the diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Dr. Smith should know about adhesive capsulitis. He's treated it every single day, day in and day out, for more than twenty-five years. He's published more than thirty articles specifically on the topic -- adhesive capsulitis has been his primary research interest since just after he graduated from Harvard medical school. Not only is Dr. Smith board-certified in orthopedic surgery, but he helps to write and administer the board-certification exam to new doctors and teaches orthopedic surgery to medical students. Now let's look at Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones isn't board certified, has never published on adhesive capsulitis, and has only done original research about knees, not shoulders. Although he treats shoulders in his practice, he's only been doing it for two years--no, sorry, only a year and a half, only eighteen months.\" The example is a little over-the-top but you get the idea. Although the example relies on only a few points of comparison, there might be many others in any given case. Don't wait until your closing argument to start thinking about them. Instead, get into the habit of viewing the medical part of the case through a points-of-comparison lens. If you do, you'll automatically think about comparisons as you prepare the case, especially when you review C.V.s and depose the treating doctors and experts.

      "text": "Iknew a lawyer who used to say that expert depositions were extremely easy. \"You only need to ask a single question,\" he'd say. \"'What are your opinions?'\" Expert depositions aren't quite that easy. Even so, there's something about expert depositions that make lawyers want to boil them down to their bare essence. It's a sort of game, like trying to prove a math theorem in the fewest steps possible. It's in this spirit that one should read a post at the Trial Lawyer Resource Center : \" Expert Witness Deposition: Five Questions To Ask .\" Here's most of the post-- Expert’s deposition. While there is no substitute for being prepared, you can take an effective deposition \"on the fly\" by remembering five essential questions and their logical subquestions: 1. Who engaged you in this case. 2. What they ask you to do? 3. What did you do? 4. What conclusions, opinions did you reach and what do you intend to testify to at trial? It might be the world's shortest expert-deposition outline. Four questions plus a fifth Ididn't include--to see it, you'll have to read the original post. Is it a good idea to start an expert deposition with such a simple plan? If nothing else, the exercise of writing a very short outline is a helpful one, as it will force you to consider what's most important about the deposition. I'll talk more about this idea in my third podcast on advanced deposition techniques, coming soon.

      "text": "Arecent case from the Illinois Appellate Court, Troyan v. Reyes (3d Distr. 9/29/06), contains a helpful primer for getting medical records into evidence without a doctor to sponsor them. Though plaintiff's counsel wanted to introduce medical records at trial, the doctors were not available to testify. As a work-around, plaintiff's counsel called the record keepers from the various hospitals and had them testify to the foundational requirements for business records, which are found in Illinois Supreme Court Rule 236. Any writing or record . . . made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence, or event, shall be admissible as evidence of the act, transaction, occurrence, or event, if made in the regular course of any business, and if it was the regular course of the business to make such a memorandum or record at the time of such an act, transaction, occurrence, or event or within a reasonable time thereafter . . . At trial, the record keepers testified to these foundational requirements. During closing, plaintiff's counsel wanted to publish the records to the jury. When the defendant objected, the trial court denied the request as to a radiology report and some of the other medical records that contained \"observations, assessments, diagnoses and impressions of certain doctors.\" On appeal, the Troyan court considered whether the medical records, which contained the opinions and diagnoses of absent doctors, should have been published to the jury under the business-records exception to the hearsay rule. After setting out the foundational requirements for business records from Rule 236, the court made the following points:"

      "text": "In Kinkel v. Cingular Wireless , ____ N.E.2d ____ (Ill. 10/5/06), the Illinois Supreme Court held that an arbitration clause that prohibited class-wide arbitration was unconscionable. The case began as an Illinois state-court class action in which plaintiff alleged that Cingular's $150 early-termination fee was an illegal penalty in violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act. Plaintiff's agreement with Cingular included an arbitration clause with a class-action waiver, that is, a provision that “no arbitrator has the authority” to resolve class claims. Based on this clause, Cingular moved to compel arbitration solely on plaintiff's individual claims. The arbitration fee was $125. Cingular did not desire arbitration on a class-wide basis. The trial court denied the motion to compel arbitration, holding that the class-action waiver was unconscionable and that the entire arbitration agreement unenforceable. After an intermediate appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court reviewed the case. The Supreme Court agreed that the prohibition of class arbitration was unconscionable. However, it also ruled that the class-action waiver was severable and that the arbitration clause could be enforced without it. The practical effect is that although Cingular can arbitrate the plaintiff's individual claims, it cannot preclude arbitration of the class claims, a result it was hoping to avoid. The Supreme Court summarized its reasoning on unconscionability as follows: In sum, we hold that under the circumstances of this case, the waiver on class actions is unconscionable. It is not unconscionable merely because it is contained in an arbitration clause. It is unconscionable because it is contained in a contract of adhesion that fails to inform the customer of the cost to her of arbitration, and that does not provide a cost-effective mechanism for individual customers to obtain a remedy for the specific injury alleged in either a judicial or an arbitral forum. We further hold that the offending clause is severable from the arbitration clause. We do not hold that class action waivers are per se unconscionable. It is not unconscionable or even unethical for a business to attempt to limit its exposure to class arbitration or litigation, but to prefer to resolve the claims of customers or clients individually. Indeed, it has been suggested that, as a matter of economic theory, consumers may benefit from reduced costs if companies are allowed to engage in this strategy. See, e.g., J. Sternlight & E. Jensen, Using Arbitration to Eliminate Consumer Class Actions: Efficient Business Practice or Unconscionable Abuse?, 67 Law & Contemp. Probs. 75, 92-99 (2004). The unconscionability of class action waivers must be determined on a case-by-case basis, considering the totality of the circumstances.
