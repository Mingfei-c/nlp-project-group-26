      "text": "A: Under the Fair Housing Act, the Department of Justice may start a lawsuit where it has reason to believe that a person or entity is engaged in a \"pattern or practice\" of discrimination, or where a denial of rights to a group of persons raises an issue of general public importance. Through these lawsuits, the Department can obtain money damages, both actual and punitive damages, for those individuals harmed by a defendant's discriminatory actions, as well as prevent any further discriminatory conduct. The violator may also be required to pay money penalties to the United States. The Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] investigates individual cases of discrimination in housing. If HUD determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred, then either the person complaining or the person against whom the complaint was filed may elect to have the case heard in federal court. In those instances, the Department of Justice will bring the case on behalf of the individual complainant. In addition, where force or a threat of force is used to deny or interfere with fair housing rights, the Department of Justice may begin criminal proceedings. Finally, in cases involving discrimination in home mortgage loans or home improvement loans, the Department may file suit under both the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act."

You must file the complaint with HUD within one year of the incident you believe to be housing discrimination. If you choose to file your own lawsuit in federal or state court, the Act requires that you do so within two years of the incident."

      "text": "A: When sexual orientation is the only basis of discrimination, no. However, these complaints are evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine whether any other form of discrimination is present (such as sex or disability, for example). Many state and local laws prohibit discrimination in housing based on sexual orientation. You should consult with your local or state civil rights enforcement agency to determine whether discrimination on this basis is protected."

Individual complaints of discrimination are handled by the creditor's federal regulatory agency. The agencies and the types of financial institutions that they regulate are as follows: Office of Thrift Supervision [OTS:]: Savings associations and federally chartered savings banks (the word \"Federal\" or the initials \"F.S.B.\" appear in federal institution's name). Comptroller of Currency [OCC]: National banks, federal branches/agencies of foreign banks (the word \"National\" or the initials \"N.A.\" appear in or after the bank's name). Federal Reserve Board [FRB]: Financial institutions that are members of the Federal Reserve System, except national banks and federal branches/agencies of foreign banks. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC]: State chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System. National Credit Union Association [NCUA]: Federal credit unions (the words \"Federal credit union\" appear in the institution's name). Federal Trade Commission {FTC]: Retailers, finance companies, creditors (including most mortgage companies) that arent assigned to another agency"
