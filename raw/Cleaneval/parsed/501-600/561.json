What do you intend to do with your retirement plan assets at this time?  You may want to consider rolling the assets in your qualified plan into an annuity-funded IRA.  While funding your IRA with an annuity offers no additional tax-advantage, there are unique annuity features to consider.  These include multiple investment choices, living benefits, death benefits, and the ability to create a stream of income you can't outlive. 1 Whether you're finally pursuing your real interests or coming back to the work force after some time off, MassMutual's disability income insurance coverage offers the convenience of portability.  No matter where you go or what changes in your life, your policy remains the same and stays with you even when you change jobs. Starting a new job may mean re-examining your insurance needs.  If you're concerned about income replacement, a pay raise will mean you need more life insurance.  Or maybe you've lost group life insurance coverage from your previous job and you need to replace that employee benefit with individual life insurance.  If you find yourself unemployed in the future, owning individual life insurance can provide continued protection. Although you may experience unexpected career developments, your financial goals should remain steady.  Mutual funds offer you the benefits of professional management and asset diversification that may help you reach your long-term financial goals. 1 Guaranteed death benefits, living benefits and payment of lifetime income are contingent upon the claims-paying ability of the issuing company or companies."
