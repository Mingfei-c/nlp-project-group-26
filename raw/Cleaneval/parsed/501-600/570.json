      "text": "Metroplex\n      Atheists \"If you're\n      interested in us, we're interested in you!\" Winter Infidels' Bash! We're trying out a new location this year. New club-member Randy Word has a big ranch down near Granbury, and he's graciously allowed us to hold our shindig there. There's plenty of back-to-nature stuff to do there (hiking, fishing, etc) and lots of great activities for kids. Randy has also offered to smoke a batch of ribs for us, so we'll have plenty to eat and do. We'll likely be having a gift-exchange, so bring along a wrapped gift worth under $10 if you'd like to participate . It also looks like we're going to have a bigger-than-average group of young kids there, so if you bring along a wrapped toy (please keep it in the under-$5 range), we'll try to do a gift exchange for the kiddos. If your kid is older than about 8, the grownup exchange would probably be better. What: Metroplex Atheists Infidels Bash When: Sunday, December 17, noon until whenever (Randy has a fire-pit and cabins if we spend too much time partying) Who: YOU! Okay, anyone who's ever been faced annoyance or condemnation for not following majority-owned holidays. We'll celebrate any winter holiday you'd like. What To Bring: Randy will be smoking ribs and sausages, but we'll need any further fixins. If you'd like to bring some chips or soda or dessert or such, email director@metroplexatheists.org and I'll help coordinate snacks so we don't end up with twenty bowls of dip and no chips. BYOB Where: Take 377 SW from I20 in SW Fort Worth towards Granbury (Benbrook exit). Stay on 377 thru Cresson and on to Granbury, take 377 Business to   downtown Granbury (the square with large rock courthouse). Go to the end of the square (1 block) and turn right on Hwy 4. Go thru town and then Hwy 4 angles/turns to the left immediately upon   crossing the RR tracks. Continue on Hwy 4 to Thorp Spring.  Stay on Hwy 4 to far end of town   and look for FM 2580.    Stay straight on Hwy 4 but immediately check your odometer.  Go   exactly 4.5mi from 2580 intersection to the turn into the ranch.    There will be a street sign there that says \"Ruff Country\".  You can   only turn right so turn right onto Ruff Country (gravel road) Again check you odometer and go exactly 0.9mi There will be an open   steel gate on your right.  There is a green street sign attached to   the gate that says \"Randy Rd\".  Turn right and you are now in the   ranch. Continue another 3/4mi on gravel/dirt road that will twist and turn   and go down a steep hill and eventually across a creek.  Don't give   up, if you take a wrong turn inside the ranch just keep driving and   you will find it.

These are collections of obscure atheist\n              literature available on CD-ROM for low prices. Many of these works\n              are very obscure and are only available publicly in these\n              collections. The pictured Robert Ingersoll CD, for example,\n              contains the entire 12-volume Dresden Edition collection of his\n              speeches and writings. This collection would cost over $1000 if\n              purchased on paper, but you can get it on CD-ROM for around $25."
