What is lupus? Lupus is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease \r\n                          in which the immune system, for unknown reasons, becomes \r\n                          hyperactive and attacks normal tissue. This attack results \r\n                          in inflammation and brings about symptoms. What does autoimmune mean? Literally it means immune activity directed against \r\n                          the self. The immune system fights the body itself (Auto=self). \r\n                          In autoimmune diseases, the immune system makes a mistake \r\n                          and reacts to the body's own tissues. What is inflammation? Literally it means setting on fire. It is a protective \r\n                          process our body uses when tissues are injured. Inflammation \r\n                          helps to eliminate a foreign body or organism (virus, \r\n                          bacteria) and prevent further injury. Signs of inflammation \r\n                          include; swelling, redness, pain and warmth. If the \r\n                          signs of inflammation are long lasting, as they can \r\n                          be in lupus, then damage to the tissues can occur and \r\n                          normal function is impaired. This is why the treatment \r\n                          of lupus is aimed at reducing the inflammation. Reference: \r\n                          see Facts & Overview, What is Lupus? What happens in autoimmune diseases like lupus? The immune system is designed to protect and defend \r\n                          the body from foreign intruders (bacteria, viruses). \r\n                          You can think of it like a security system for your \r\n                          body. It contains several different types of cells, \r\n                          some of which function like \"security guards\" and are \r\n                          constantly on patrol looking for any foreign invaders. \r\n                          When they spot one, they take action, and eliminate \r\n                          the intruder. In lupus, for some reason and we don't \r\n                          know why, the immune system loses its ability to tell \r\n                          the difference between a foreign intruder and a person's \r\n                          own normal tissues and cells. So, in essence, the \"Security \r\n                          Guards\" make a mistake, and they mistakenly identify \r\n                          the person's own normal cells as foreign (antigens), \r\n                          and then take action to eliminate them. Part of their \r\n                          response is to bring antibodies to the site that then \r\n                          attach to antigens (anything that the immune system \r\n                          recognizes as non-self or foreign) and form immune complexes. \r\n                          These immune complexes help to set in motion a series \r\n                          of events that result in inflammation at the site. These \r\n                          immune complexes may travel through the circulation \r\n                          (blood) and lodge in distant tissues and cause inflammation \r\n                          there. Where did the name come from? Lupus is the Latin word for wolf. The term has been \r\n                          associated with the disease since the 10th century, \r\n                          though the reasons are unclear. Erythematosus means \r\n                          redness. It is speculated that the name was given to \r\n                          describe the skin lesions (sores), which typically are \r\n                          red and perhaps at that time in history were thought \r\n                          to resemble the bite of a wolf. Today we know that not \r\n                          everyone with lupus has rashes or skin lesions, and \r\n                          those who do would not say their rashes look anything \r\n                          like a wolf bite. Who gets lupus? Lupus can occur at any age, and in either sex. Nine \r\n                          out of ten people with lupus are women. During the childbearing \r\n                          years (ages 15-44) lupus strikes women 10-15 times more \r\n                          frequently than men. People of all races can have lupus; however, African \r\n                          American women have a three times higher incidence (number \r\n                          of new cases) and mortality than Caucasian women. They \r\n                          tend to develop the disease at a younger age and to \r\n                          develop more serious complications. Lupus is also more \r\n                          common in women of Hispanic, Asian, and Native American \r\n                          descent. The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal \r\n                          and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) has developed a strategic \r\n                          plan for reducing health disparities. Lupus is included \r\n                          as an area of research focus. Further information on \r\n                          disparities in lupus and the strategic plan is available \r\n                          at: http://www.niams.nih.gov/an/stratplan/stratplan.htm What are the symptoms of lupus? Symptoms of lupus \r\n                          vary widely depending on the individual case and the \r\n                          form of lupus present. Most people with lupus do not \r\n                          experience all of these symptoms. The list only serves \r\n                          to alert people to clues that might indicate the presence \r\n                          of lupus in an undiagnosed person. Achy or swollen joints Persistent fever over 100 degrees Prolonged, extreme fatigue Skin rashes, including a butterfly shaped rash \r\n                            across the cheeks and nose Pain in the chest on deep breathing Anemia Excessive protein in the urine Sensitivity to sun or ultraviolet light Hair loss Abnormal blood clotting problems Fingers turning white and/or blue in the cold Seizures Mouth or nose ulcers lasting longer than two weeks < \r\n                          Back 2. Are there different kinds of lupus? There are four forms of lupus including: Cutaneous lupus erythematosus affects the skin. There \r\n                        are many different types of cutaneous lupus including: Chronic cutaneous LE (CCLE) which is sometimes \r\n                            called discoid. Subacute cutaneous LE (SCLE), and Acute cutaneous LE (ACLE). See brochure: Skin \r\n                        Disease in Lupus Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) attacks \r\n                          multiple systems in the body which may include: the \r\n                          skin, joints, lungs, blood, blood vessels, heart, kidneys, \r\n                          liver, brain and the nervous system. See Facts & Overview: What is \r\n                          Lupus? Drug-induced lupus may develop after taking \r\n                          certain prescription medications. Symptoms generally \r\n                          disappear, within weeks to months, after the drug is \r\n                          discontinued. See brochure: Drug-Induced \r\n                          Lupus Erythematosus Neonatal lupus, a fourth type, is a rare condition. \r\n                          It is not the same thing as SLE.

Reference: see Facts & Overview, Types \r\n                          of Lupus Lupus in Overlap The majority of people with lupus have lupus alone. \r\n                          Between five and thirty percent of people with lupus \r\n                          report having overlap symptoms characteristic of one \r\n                          or more connective tissue diseases. There are several \r\n                          well-recognized overlaps that may affect people with \r\n                          lupus including: lupus and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), \r\n                          lupus and myositis, lupus and systemic sclerosis (SSc \r\n                          or scleroderma), lupus and Sjogren's syndrome (SS).

No, not even through sexual contact. < \r\n                          Back 4. Is lupus a fatal \r\n                          disease? Lupus is not a universally fatal disease. In fact, today \r\n                          with close follow-up and treatment, 80-90% of the people \r\n                          with lupus can expect to live a normal life span. Lupus \r\n                          does vary in intensity and degree, however, and there \r\n                          are people who have a mild case, there are those who \r\n                          have a moderate case and there are some who have a severe \r\n                          case of lupus, which tends to be more difficult to treat \r\n                          and bring under control. For people who have a severe \r\n                          flare-up, there is a greater chance that their lupus \r\n                          may be life-threatening. We know that some people do \r\n                          die of this disease and because of that we have a tremendous \r\n                          amount of respect for the potential of this disease. \r\n                          However, the majority of people living with lupus today \r\n                          can expect to live a normal lifespan. People frequently read in the literature that, 80-90% \r\n                          of people with lupus live for more than ten years. Unfortunately, \r\n                          this is often misinterpreted as- people with lupus live \r\n                          for only ten years. Let us clarify this. It is important to understand that the \"10 years\" does \r\n                          not represent the number of years the person will live, \r\n                          but rather the number of years involved in the study. \r\n                          The studies followed patients with lupus from the time \r\n                          of diagnosis for a period of ten years. At the end of \r\n                          this research period they were able to conclude that \r\n                          80-90% of the people enrolled were still alive. What \r\n                          this study did not look at is what happened in year \r\n                          11, 12, 15, 20 and so on. We know there are many people \r\n                          who have been living with lupus for 15, 19, 25, 30 and \r\n                          40 years. This is not a disease that is universally \r\n                          fatal to all. The majority of people with lupus today \r\n                          can expect to live a normal lifespan. When people die of lupus, what do they usually die \r\n                          of? Overwhelming infection and kidney failure are the two \r\n                          most common causes of death in people with lupus. < \r\n                          Back 5. Lupus and cancer Is lupus a form of cancer? No, lupus is not a form of cancer. It is an autoimmune \r\n                          disease. Are people with lupus more likely to develop cancers? People with lupus are no more likely to develop cancer \r\n                          than are people in the general population. However, \r\n                          people who have received certain chemotherapy drugs \r\n                          do carry the added risk of developing cancer sometime \r\n                          later in life. Are there any special considerations regarding treatment \r\n                          of cancer in people with lupus? Cancer can be treated \r\n                          in many ways; with surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. \r\n                          All people with lupus who have surgery for cancer, should \r\n                          be followed closely by their personal physician and/or \r\n                          the rheumatologist to evaluate the activity of their \r\n                          lupus throughout the course. For patients receiving \r\n                          steroid therapy and surgical procedures, their steroid \r\n                          dosage will have to be adjusted during the time just \r\n                          shortly before surgery and then tapered slowly over \r\n                          time after surgery. If a person is scheduled for surgery \r\n                          and they take non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs \r\n                          or aspirin, any of which may effect their clotting time, \r\n                          these medications will need to be stopped prior to surgery \r\n                          in order to minimize bleeding. Chemotherapy usually doesn't present any particular \r\n                          problems and can in turn treat active lupus. < \r\n                          Back 6. Is lupus like AIDS? No. In AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) the \r\n                          immune system is under active; it is deficient. In lupus \r\n                          the immune system is overactive, producing large quantities \r\n                          of antibodies. AIDS is contagious but lupus is not. \r\n                          The majority of people diagnosed with AIDS die from \r\n                          their disease whereas the majority of people with lupus \r\n                          can expect to live a normal lifespan. < \r\n                          Back 7. Lupus anticoagulant Iwas just diagnosed with the lupus anticoagulant. \r\n                          Does this mean Ihave systemic lupus? The lupus anticoagulant is classified as a type of antiphospholipid \r\n                          antibody that was first detected in people with lupus. \r\n                          It was later learned that many people who do not have \r\n                          lupus, also produce these antibodies. In fact, according \r\n                          to most studies, greater than 50% of the people who \r\n                          have antiphospolipid antibodies, DO NOT have lupus. \r\n                          So, just because a person has the lupus anticoagulant \r\n                          antibodies does not necessarily mean that they have \r\n                          or will develop systemic lupus. There is a syndrome called the \"Primary\" Antiphospholipid \r\n                          Syndrome (PAPS). This term is used to describe people \r\n                          who do not have any signs or symptoms of SLE but produce \r\n                          antiphospholipid antibodies such as the lupus anticoagulant \r\n                          and/or anti-cardiolipin antibodies and experience problems \r\n                          with blood clots, miscarriages, or thrombocytopenia \r\n                          (low platelets). People with PAPS do not have lupus.

Yes. Although these antibodies were first discovered \r\n                          in people who had lupus, it was later learned there \r\n                          are many people who produce these antibodies who do \r\n                          not have systemic lupus.

Yes. In fact, most people with these antibodies DO NOT \r\n                        and will not have symptoms related to them.

Lupus and multiple \r\n                          sclerosis Iwas diagnosed with MS 3 years ago and now my doctor \r\n                          thinks Imay have lupus. Is there a connection between \r\n                          MS and lupus? Multiple Sclerosis and lupus are both autoimmune diseases. \r\n                          They are diagnosed and treated in very different ways. \r\n                          There is no direct connection between the two, however, \r\n                          lupus, known as a great imposter, can sometimes mimic \r\n                          or imitate the symptoms of MS. Reference: see brochure, Systemic \r\n                          Lupus and the Nervous System My MRI from 3 years ago showed plaques. Is there \r\n                          anything on the MRI of people with lupus of the nervous \r\n                          system that is diagnostic for CNS lupus? Diagnosis of CNS lupus is difficult as there is not \r\n                          one specific diagnostic test to detect nervous system \r\n                          involvement in lupus. The abnormalities seen on the \r\n                          MRI scans are not specific for systemic lupus. In other \r\n                          words, they could be due to a number of things. The \r\n                          findings on these specialized tests and sometimes other \r\n                          tests such as a brain wave test (electroencephalogram, \r\n                          EEG) and a spinal tap have to be considered along with \r\n                          clinical and laboratory findings in establishing a diagnosis \r\n                          of CNS lupus.

My child has lupus. \r\n                          What is the prognosis?

What are the symptoms of cutaneous \r\n                          lupus? The symptoms of cutaneous lupus may include a variety \r\n                          of different looking skin rashes, photosensitivity (where \r\n                          exposure to ultra-violet light triggers a rash), and \r\n                          sometimes ulcers on the inside of the nose or mouth. Reference: see brochure, Skin \r\n                          Disease and Lupus What do the rashes look like? There are a variety of ways that cutaneous lupus rashes \r\n                          can appear. The distinctive rash is called the \"butterfly \r\n                          rash,\" which is a rash that extends across the cheeks \r\n                          of the face and the bridge of the nose. It can be flat \r\n                          or raised; it can be bright red or it can be just a \r\n                          mild blushing, light pink coloration to the skin. It \r\n                          appears on the face in a pattern that looks like a butterfly; \r\n                          the wings are beneath both eyes and the body of the \r\n                          butterfly covers the bridge of the nose. Here is one \r\n                          example of what a butterfly \r\n                          rash may look like. (Photo source: \r\n                          Dept. of Dermatology, University of Iowa) Another classic rash found in cutaneous lupus is the discoid rash . This rash is coin-shaped or oval \r\n                          in shape, like a disk and it is seen on areas of the \r\n                          skin that are exposed to sunlight. Discoid lesions (sores) \r\n                          tend to be red and raised and become scaly. When they \r\n                          heal they can leave behind a scar. These rashes can \r\n                          also result in a change in coloring of the skin, making \r\n                          the area around the lesion either lighter or darker \r\n                          in color. These discoid lesions may appear on the scalp; \r\n                          on the face in a butterfly distribution; or, as mentioned \r\n                          earlier, in areas where the skin receives sun exposure, \r\n                          especially, for example, the Vof the neck. Discoid \r\n                          lupus erythematosus (LE) lesions are usually painless \r\n                          and typically do not itch. Here is one example of what \r\n                          a discoid \r\n                          rash may look like. (Photo source: \r\n                          Dermatology Information System, Dermis.net) Chronic cutaneous lupus may also appear in different \r\n                          forms including: verrucous (wart-like) discoid LE lupus tumidus - elevated areas of red skin with \r\n                            no scale or scarring lupus profundus - discoid skin lesions in conjunction \r\n                            with panniculitis palmar-plantar erosive discoid LE - discoid lesions \r\n                            on the hands and feet Another type of lupus skin rash is classified as the subacute \r\n                        cutaneous lesions. These are lesions characterized \r\n                        by redness. They are also coin-shaped, very photosensitive \r\n                        and they get worse when exposed to ultra-violet light. \r\n                        These are lesions that do not leave behind scars, and \r\n                        can appear over large areas of the body. People who have \r\n                        subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE-a subset \r\n                        of cutaneous lupus) may experience systemic symptoms such \r\n                        as: muscle and joint pain, fever and general discomfort. Serious kidney or nervous system problems are rare. These are just a few examples of what cutaneous lupus \r\n                          rashes may look like. Because the appearance of skin \r\n                          rashes in lupus can be quite variable, it can be difficult \r\n                          to diagnose just by looking at the lesion, and therefore \r\n                          other tests may be necessary. Reference: \"The Skin In Lupus,\" by Richard D. Sontheimer, \r\n                          M.D. & Thomas T. Provost, M.D. Lupus News, Volume 18, \r\n                          Number 2, Spring 1998. How is cutaneous lupus diagnosed? Cutaneous lupus, because of the great deal of variability \r\n                          in the way that the skin rashes may appear, can be quite \r\n                          difficult to diagnose. However, a skin biopsy may be \r\n                          performed and this may be diagnostic. What kind of Doctor specializes in cutaneous lupus? Adermatologist specializes in diseases of the skin, \r\n                          hair and nails. Cutaneous lupus is one of hundreds of \r\n                          diseases that involve these areas. How is cutaneous lupus treated? Treatment of cutaneous lupus may include corticosteroid \r\n                          creams or ointments applied to the rash or lesions. \r\n                          If the lesion does not respond to cream or ointment, \r\n                          the doctor may prescribe injections of corticosteroids \r\n                          directly into the lesion. If a person has particularly \r\n                          widespread lesions, oral corticosteroid medications \r\n                          may be prescribed or the doctor may prescribe anti-malarial \r\n                          medications such as Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine). In addition to these medications, sunscreens are an \r\n                          important part of the prevention of photosensitivity \r\n                          (where skin exposed to ultra-violet light reacts by \r\n                          developing a rash) reactions that may occur with cutaneous \r\n                          lupus lesions.

How is cutaneous lupus different \r\n                          from systemic lupus? Cutaneous lupus is confined to the skin, whereas systemic \r\n                          lupus may involve not only the skin but any of the other \r\n                          organ systems in the body. Can cutaneous lupus turn into systemic lupus? In approximately 10% of the cases of cutaneous lupus, \r\n                          it evolves and develops into systemic lupus. However, \r\n                          this can't be predicted or prevented from happening.

Ihave hair loss due to several \r\n                          scars on my scalp. All are about the size of silver \r\n                          dollars. Is there anything to help this kind of hair \r\n                          loss? If biopsy results indicate advanced scarring on the \r\n                          scalp, then there is little chance of bringing back \r\n                          significant amounts of hair. If, on the other hand, \r\n                          scarring is not prevalent, then treatment with corticosteroid \r\n                          and/or antimalarial drugs may be successful in getting \r\n                          the hair to return. When the disease is inactive, and \r\n                          scarring is not present hair usually grows back.

Can lupus cause either hives \r\n                          or a sensation of burning in the skin? Lupus may cause hives. Itching can also occur but this \r\n                          is not a common finding. The sensation of itching is \r\n                          due to irritation of nerve fibers in the skin. If the \r\n                          irritation is more intense, it may cause a burning sensation. < \r\n                          Back 15. What is photosensitivity and \r\n                          what are photosensitivity reactions? Photosensitivity is sensitivity to the UV (ultra-violet) \r\n                          rays from the sunlight and other UV light sources. Photosensitivity \r\n                          reactions typically include a rash, but may also trigger \r\n                          fever, fatigue, joint pain and other symptoms of SLE. \r\n                          In some cases, sun exposure has resulted in the onset \r\n                          of kidney disease.

What is the difference between \r\n                          drug-induced lupus (DIL) and systemic lupus? Systemic lupus is irreversible, whereas drug-induced \r\n                          lupus generally is reversible when the drug is discontinued. \r\n                          The symptoms of drug-induced lupus generally DO NOT \r\n                          include kidney involvement or central nervous system \r\n                          involvement What drugs are most commonly associated with DIL? There is just a short list of medications for which \r\n                          there is DEFINITE PROOF of an association with drug-induced \r\n                          lupus. The list includes 5 medications. Procainamide (pro-can-a-mide) brand names Procan \r\n                          or Pronestyl used for heart rhythm abnormalities Hydralazine (hi-dral-a-zine) brand name Apresoline \r\n                          or Apresazide used for high blood pressure Isoniazid (i-so-nye-a-zid) brand name INH used \r\n                          for tuberculosis Quinidine (quin-i-dean) used for heart rhythm \r\n                          abnormalities Phenytoin , brand name Dilantin used for convulsive \r\n                          disorders (seizures). Are there other drugs that might cause DIL? The overwhelming majority of cases of DIL are due to \r\n                          one of the 5 drugs mentioned earlier. There are other \r\n                          drugs, which might POSSIBLY be associated, but there \r\n                          is not yet definite proof of an association between \r\n                          them and drug-induced lupus. Check with your doctor \r\n                          to see if you are on any medication that might possibly \r\n                          explain your symptoms. Should people diagnosed with SLE or Cutaneous lupus \r\n                          avoid taking the drugs associated with drug-induced \r\n                          Lupus? Most of the drugs associated with DIL can be safely \r\n                          used in people with SLE or cutaneous lupus if there \r\n                          are no suitable alternatives. How soon after taking the drug do the symptoms appear? Drug-induced lupus requires months to years of frequent \r\n                          exposure to a drug before symptoms appear. How soon after discontinuing the drug will the symptoms \r\n                          go away? It varies from days, to weeks, to months. Usually symptoms \r\n                          fade after six months. The ANA may remain positive for \r\n                          years.

It is likely to \r\n                          be due to a combination of factors. For example, a person's \r\n                          genetic make-up and exposure to certain unknown trigger \r\n                          factors may provide the right environment in which lupus \r\n                          can develop.

We suspect (but do not have scientific proof) that people \r\n                          inherit something from their parents that predisposes \r\n                          them to develop lupus. They are not necessarily pre-destined \r\n                          to develop lupus, but they may be more susceptible. \r\n                          At the present time, there are no genetic tests to determine \r\n                          who is susceptible and who is not. Reference: see Facts & Overview, What \r\n                          is Lupus? Where is genetic research being done? Several researchers are doing Linkage Studies to evaluate \r\n                          families in which more than one member has lupus. They \r\n                          hope to be able to identify a gene or genes that are \r\n                          responsible for lupus. Undoubtedly the resources of \r\n                          all of these groups will eventually be pooled, but there \r\n                          is much to be gained from the current phase of multiple \r\n                          independent efforts. Participation in multiple studies \r\n                          is encouraged. More are listed in the Clinical Trials \r\n                          section.

It is believed that certain things may trigger the onset \r\n                          of lupus or cause lupus to flare. Trigger factors include: Ultra-violet (UV) light Certain prescription drugs Infection Certain antibiotics Hormones Although there is no scientific evidence, it is possible \r\n                          that extreme stress may play a role in triggering lupus. Reference: see Facts & Overview, What \r\n                          is Lupus? Is lupus stress related? We do not know for certain. There are many anecdotal \r\n                          reports (personal accounts) of lupus flaring during \r\n                          or after a stressful time, but this question requires \r\n                          further scientific study. Are flares related to hormones? We do not know for sure. There are many anecdotal reports \r\n                          (personal accounts) of lupus flaring with pregnancy, \r\n                          the menstrual cycle, birth control pills, and hormone \r\n                          replacement therapy. We suspect that hormones play a \r\n                          role, but we don't know precisely what the role is. \r\n                          Lupus has a 9:1 female to male ratio so it is likely \r\n                          that hormones play a role, perhaps by influencing the \r\n                          immune system. Also, we know that female hormones have \r\n                          a definite effect on lupus mice used in research. Are there any medications people with lupus should \r\n                          avoid? There are no absolute contraindications to needed and \r\n                          appropriate medications for a person with systemic lupus. \r\n                          Your doctor should watch for allergic reactions to medications, \r\n                          and watch for any connection between flares and estrogen \r\n                          or oral contraceptives. People with lupus should be especially careful if they \r\n                          are prescribed sulfa antibiotics. These medications \r\n                          (Bactrim, Gantrisin, Septra) are often prescribed for \r\n                          urinary tract infections and may cause an increase in \r\n                          sun sensitivity and occasionally lower blood counts \r\n                          resulting in disease flares. There are also sulfa diuretics \r\n                          (water pills) such as Dyazide and diabetic drugs containing \r\n                          sulfa such as Aldactone. Does lupus occur more often in certain geographical \r\n                          areas? No. Is lupus related to pollution or toxic chemicals? We do not know. The cause of lupus, and many other autoimmune \r\n                          diseases, remains unknown. The respective roles of genetic \r\n                          and environmental factors in triggering lupus remain \r\n                          to be determined. The National Institutes of Health \r\n                          (NIH), the principal biomedical research agency of the \r\n                          United States Government established the National Institute \r\n                          of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to study issues \r\n                          related to environmental health. Ameeting in September \r\n                          of 1998 at Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in Durham, \r\n                          NC organized by NIEHS, looked at autoimmunity and the \r\n                          environment and specifically lupus. Areview of the \r\n                          discussion was published in the medical journal, Arthritis \r\n                          and Rheumatism (1998 Oct; 41(10): 1714-24) in an article \r\n                          titled: \"Hormonal, Environmental, and Infectious Risk \r\n                          Factors for Developing Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\" \r\n                          by Cooper GS, Dooley MA, Treadwell EL, St Clair EW, \r\n                          Parks CG, Gilkeson GS.

Silicone breast implants Ihave silicone breast implants and am being tested \r\n                          for lupus. Is there any connection between silicone \r\n                          implants and lupus? There has been a great deal of interest in this issue \r\n                          and to date there have been numerous well controlled \r\n                          research studies since 1992 that have looked at this \r\n                          question. However, none has shown a clear association \r\n                          between silicone breast implants and the development \r\n                          of lupus disease. In March 1998, the National Institutes of Health requested \r\n                          that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National \r\n                          Academy of Sciences (NAS) provide an independent, unbiased \r\n                          review of past and ongoing research on the health effects \r\n                          of silicone breast implants. To respond to this request, \r\n                          the IOM established a committee of 12 experts in relevant \r\n                          scientific and clinical areas to assess the scientific \r\n                          information on silicone breast implants and the relationship, \r\n                          if any, to various health conditions. Aone-day scientific workshop was convened on July 22, \r\n                          1998 in Washington, DC-testimony included epidemiology \r\n                          and observational studies, immunology reports, company \r\n                          data from Mentor Corp. and Dow Corning Corp., and surgery, \r\n                          pathology, and radiology information. Apublic hearing \r\n                          followed on July 24, to gather information and views \r\n                          from a wide range of lay, advocacy, industry, and public \r\n                          policy groups. The following year, in June of 1999, the Institute of \r\n                          Medicine's final report concurred with the scientific \r\n                          evidence that had accumulated over the previous 7 years \r\n                          which does not support the notion that silicone breast \r\n                          implants cause lupus. At the present time, as far as \r\n                          we know, there is no scientific evidence to indicate \r\n                          a cause-effect relationship between silicone breast \r\n                          implants and lupus. If Ihave my implants removed, will my lupus symptoms \r\n                          improve, will the lupus go away? We don't know. There \r\n                          have been reports of women who had silicone breast implants \r\n                          removed and their symptoms improved. On the other hand, \r\n                          there have been cases where symptoms have not improved \r\n                          after removal.

Is there any truth to the \r\n                          claims being circulated on the Internet that lupus is \r\n                          caused by the artificial sweetener, aspartame? We are aware there is an email message circulating on \r\n                          the Internet warning individuals with lupus about dangers \r\n                          associated with using the artificial sweetener aspartame. \r\n                          The Lupus Foundation of America consulted with the chair \r\n                          of the LFA Medical Council, Evelyn Hess, MD, MACP, MACR. \r\n                          Dr. Hess is one of the nation's leading researchers \r\n                          in the field of lupus specializing in environmental \r\n                          influences. According to Dr. Hess, there is, as of now, \r\n                          no specific proof of an association with aspartame as \r\n                          a cause or worsening of SLE. People with lupus should always consult with their physician \r\n                          before making any changes in their medical treatment, \r\n                          diet, exercise or other routine based on information \r\n                          received via the Internet or other sources lacking known \r\n                          credentials. < \r\n                          Back DIAGNOSIS 23. Is there a test for systemic \r\n                          lupus? There is not a single diagnostic test for systemic lupus. Reference: see brochure, Laboratory \r\n                          Tests Used in the Diagnosis of Lupus < \r\n                          Back 24. Why is systemic lupus so difficult \r\n                          to diagnose? It is difficult for a number of reasons: Systemic lupus is a multi-system disease, and before \r\n                            a multi-system disease can be diagnosed, there have \r\n                            to be symptoms in many parts of the body and lab work \r\n                            that supports the presence of a multi-system disease. Systemic lupus is also difficult to diagnose because \r\n                            it is a disease that does not typically develop rapidly, \r\n                            but rather develops slowly and evolves over time. \r\n                            Symptoms come and go and it generally takes time to \r\n                            gradually accumulate enough symptoms to indicate that \r\n                            a multi-system disease is present. The Systemic lupus is known as a Great Imitator because \r\n                            it mimics so many other diseases and conditions. Systemic lupus is difficult to diagnose because \r\n                            there is no single diagnostic test for lupus. In fact, \r\n                            many people may have positive lupus tests-particularly \r\n                            the anti-nuclear antibody test-and yet NOT have the \r\n                            disease. How is systemic lupus diagnosed? Physicians have to gather information from a variety \r\n                          of sources: past medical history, lab tests and current \r\n                          symptoms. They use a list of 11 criteria to help diagnose \r\n                          SLE. Aperson needs to satisfy at least 4 out of the \r\n                          11 criteria before the diagnosis can be pinpointed (see \r\n                          list in What is Lupus? brochure). Some criteria, such \r\n                          as a biopsy diagnosis of kidney lupus, can carry more \r\n                          weight. Of the 11 criteria, 7 relate to symptoms, and 4 have \r\n                          to do with lab tests. The ANA test is used as a screening \r\n                          test for systemic lupus. We know that 95 % of people \r\n                          with SLE have a positive ANA. Therefore, if a person \r\n                          has many symptoms of systemic lupus and their ANA test \r\n                          is negative, that's generally regarded as pretty good \r\n                          evidence against lupus being the explanation for the \r\n                          symptoms they are having. If on the other hand, the ANA comes back positive, that \r\n                          IS NOT proof of lupus. The positive ANA is only an indicator; \r\n                          it is not diagnostic. Apositive ANA can be found in \r\n                          a number of illnesses and conditions including: Rheumatoid arthritis Sjogren's (show-grens) syndrome Scleroderma (sklare-a-derm-a) Infectious diseases such as: Mononucleosis Malaria Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) Autoimmune diseases including: Autoimmune thyroid disease Autoimmune liver disease Certain medications can also cause a positive ANA. \r\n                          About 20% of the general population when tested will \r\n                          have a positive ANA and not have any of the above mentioned \r\n                          illnesses. The ANA is only a test and like a high cholesterol \r\n                          value, a positive ANA doesn't necessarily equate having \r\n                          a disease. So, a positive ANA, by itself, is not diagnostic of \r\n                          any one particular disease and may be present in people \r\n                          who have no illness. Although it is often referred to \r\n                          as \"a lupus test,\" it is not like a pregnancy test where \r\n                          a positive result can mean only one thing. The ANA is \r\n                          only an indicator, which points in several possible \r\n                          directions. Apositive ANA satisfies only one criterion. \r\n                          Aperson would need to satisfy at least 3 additional \r\n                          criteria.

Confusion About Diagnosis I've seen a list of symptoms of lupus and Ihave \r\n                          just about every one. The doctor Iwent to doesn't think \r\n                          Ihave lupus, but he doesn't seem to know too much about \r\n                          it. How can Ibe sure Ido or do not have lupus? Lupus is a very difficult disease to diagnose. Physicians \r\n                          use a list of 11 criteria to assist in the diagnosis. \r\n                          The criteria consist of symptoms and lab tests, which \r\n                          tend to be specific to SLE. The list of 11 criteria \r\n                          is not to be confused with lists of common symptoms \r\n                          of systemic lupus, such as: fatigue, fever, weight loss, \r\n                          hair loss, nausea, Raynaud's phenomenon. These symptoms, \r\n                          could be due to numerous illnesses or conditions, and, \r\n                          therefore, are too vague to be included as diagnostic \r\n                          criteria. If a person has many of the symptoms of systemic lupus, \r\n                          the physician may suspect lupus is developing, and evaluate \r\n                          the patient to see if any criteria are met. If fewer \r\n                          than 4 criteria are satisfied, there is insufficient \r\n                          evidence to diagnose systemic lupus. Arheumatologist \r\n                          or a clinical immunologist may be consulted if you are \r\n                          looking for a specialist who has the expertise to diagnose \r\n                          and treat lupus. Reference: see Facts & Overview, What \r\n                          is Lupus? Iam afraid Imight have lupus and my doctor is going \r\n                          to miss something and end up diagnosing me with lupus \r\n                          too late. If Ihave it, Iwant to be diagnosed as early \r\n                          as possible. How can Imake sure Iam diagnosed earlier \r\n                          rather than later? Because lupus tends to develop slowly and evolve gradually \r\n                          over time, awaiting a diagnosis can be like waiting \r\n                          for a Polaroid picture to develop. If you are seen by \r\n                          a doctor at a point in time when only one or two criteria \r\n                          are satisfied, it is like looking at a picture that \r\n                          is only one-quarter or half-way developed. No one looking \r\n                          at that picture can accurately identify what it is. \r\n                          Nor can they predict if it will develop at all or what \r\n                          it will develop into, or how long it will be before \r\n                          it is developed to the point where it's identifiable. \r\n                          Just as there is no good way to speed-up the development \r\n                          of a Polaroid, there is no way to hurry-up the diagnosis \r\n                          of lupus. The length of time it takes before lupus can be diagnosed \r\n                          is highly variable; it may take weeks, months or years; \r\n                          three years is not an uncommon length of time for many \r\n                          people to have symptoms before being diagnosed. In some \r\n                          cases, it can take as long as 10 years before enough \r\n                          evidence has accumulated to indicate that it is lupus. \r\n                          However, generally a doctor has a pretty good idea, \r\n                          though s/he may not be certain, that a person does or \r\n                          does not have SLE. The important thing is to learn the \r\n                          signs and symptoms of lupus and if you develop something \r\n                          new, let your doctor know so s/he can determine if you \r\n                          have yet satisfied enough criteria to be diagnosed. My doctor suspects Ihave lupus, but hasn't diagnosed \r\n                          me with it yet. Ihave a lot of joint pain in my hands \r\n                          and knees. Can anything be prescribed to give me some \r\n                          relief, or do Ihave to wait until Ihave a definite \r\n                          diagnosis before they can treat me? Sometimes, a trial of lupus medications is helpful, \r\n                          so discuss this with your doctor. My Doctor said my lupus test came back \"borderline \r\n                          positive.\" What does this mean? The screening test for lupus is called the ANA (antinuclear \r\n                          antibody). All lab tests have normal values. If a test \r\n                          result comes back and the value is at the upper limit \r\n                          of normal, this is often referred to as being on the \r\n                          border or borderline. These results are often very difficult \r\n                          to interpret; and the assessment of its importance is \r\n                          dependent on meeting other criterion. It is likely that \r\n                          a borderline positive ANA assumes more importance if \r\n                          other criteria are also present. Iwas told my ANA was positive, but Idon't have \r\n                          lupus. My Doctor thinks Ihave a connective tissue disease. \r\n                          What does this mean? Connective tissue includes joints, tendons, cartilage, \r\n                          collagen, muscles and skin. There are a number of connective \r\n                          tissue diseases; rheumatoid arthritis, scleroderma, \r\n                          Sjogren's syndrome, Raynaud's phenomenon, vasculitis, \r\n                          polymyositis and dermatomyositis. It is not uncommon \r\n                          for a person to have symptoms that indicate a connective \r\n                          tissue disease, but not enough symptoms to clearly specify \r\n                          a particular disease.

Is it possible to have lupus with a negative \r\n                          ANA? Approximately 95% of people with systemic lupus \r\n                          have a positive ANA. Only a small percentage have a \r\n                          negative ANA, and many of those have other antibodies \r\n                          detected in their blood (antiphospholipid antibodies, \r\n                          anti-Ro, anti-SSA). Sometimes the ANA will convert from \r\n                          positive to negative following administration of steroids, \r\n                          cytotoxic medications or uremia (kidney failure). What kind of Doctor can diagnose systemic lupus? If multiple criteria are present simultaneously, the \r\n                          diagnosis may be made by any physician (Family Practitioner, \r\n                          Internist, Pediatrician). If however, as is often the \r\n                          case, symptoms develop gradually over time, the diagnosis \r\n                          may not be as obvious and consultation with a rheumatologist \r\n                          may be needed. My doctor suspects that Imay be developing lupus, \r\n                          but Idon't satisfy enough criteria to be diagnosed. \r\n                          Is there anything Ican do to slow its development or \r\n                          prevent it from occurring? If you are indeed developing lupus, there is no known \r\n                          way of arresting it. You can, however, be an active \r\n                          participant in your well being by: learning as much as you can about lupus so if you \r\n                            develop further symptoms, you will recognize them \r\n                            and notify your doctor, eating a well balanced diet, managing stress more effectively, and following your doctor's advice. Iwas told my ANA was positive and Ihave a lot \r\n                          of pain, but my doctor thinks Ihave fibromyalgia and \r\n                          not lupus. What does this mean? Patients with positive ANA's and muscle and joint pain \r\n                          do not necessarily have lupus. Fibromyalgia, which is \r\n                          also common in women, sometimes explains the widespread \r\n                          pain. Resources: Fibromyalgia Network, P.O.

Iwas diagnosed with systemic \r\n                          lupus. Are there any do's or don'ts with regard to: Diet - There is no such thing as a lupus diet. \r\n                          People with lupus should consider following a diet such \r\n                          as the American Heart Association's diet or the American \r\n                          Cancer Society diet.

Alfalfa sprouts are in the legume family and contain \r\n                          an amino acid, L-canavanine. It can stimulate the immune \r\n                          system in people with lupus and increase inflammation. \r\n                          Other legumes are safe to eat as they have a much lower \r\n                          concentration of L-canavanine compared to alfalfa sprouts. \r\n                          Check labels on health food packaging as alfalfa may \r\n                          also be found as an ingredient in food products.

Exercise - Exercise is to be encouraged in people \r\n                          with lupus, particularly during a time when lupus symptoms \r\n                          are not pronounced. Walking, swimming, bicycling and \r\n                          other aerobic activities are good. But keep in mind \r\n                          that you want to exercise in moderation and avoid exercising \r\n                          to the point of exhaustion. Regular exercise will help \r\n                          you function better and improve fatigue and your sense \r\n                          of well being.

It is important to recognize \r\n                          this as a signal that your body needs to rest. It is \r\n                          essential that during a time of flare you get sufficient \r\n                          rest. This may include naps during the day, modifying \r\n                          your schedule as well as restructuring your priorities. \r\n                          Adjusting to fatigue often requires that you learn how \r\n                          to pace yourself in order to accomplish the things you \r\n                          want to accomplish throughout a day. Regular aerobic \r\n                          exercise that achieves enhanced physical conditioning, \r\n                          usually helps fatigue. Avoid strenuous exercise if you \r\n                          have fever or other signs of VERY active disease.

This may require naps during the day-a brief cat \r\n                          nap can be of tremendous help. It's important to get \r\n                          enough sleep at night and to pace yourself during the \r\n                          day so you don't exhaust yourself. Medications - Be sure and take your medications \r\n                          as prescribed by your doctor. If you develop any side \r\n                          effects make sure you let your doctor know what they \r\n                          are. Make it a point to understand what the medication \r\n                          you take is supposed to do so you will be able to recognize \r\n                          if it is indeed working. Also, ask how long before you \r\n                          should see the effects of the medication and if you \r\n                          find it's not working within the time frame, let your \r\n                          doctor know. Work schedule -The type of work schedule someone \r\n                          with lupus can accommodate is variable. Many people \r\n                          with lupus are able to work a full-time job, others \r\n                          find they have to cut back to part-time. Some people \r\n                          find they are unable to work and some apply for and \r\n                          receive disability. < \r\n                          Back 27. Flares How can Itell if my lupus is active? When a lupus flare occurs, people will usually notice \r\n                          a return of the symptoms they experienced previously, \r\n                          but sometimes they will notice new symptoms. These may \r\n                          include, but are not limited to: Fever Swollen joints Increase in fatigue Rashes Sores or ulcers in the mouth or nose Atemperature over 100 degrees, not due to an infection, \r\n                          is often a    helpful sign in identifying \r\n                          a flare. When should Icall the Doctor? You should call the doctor about any change in symptoms \r\n                            or worsening of your lupus as soon as possible. You \r\n                            should also be aware that there are certain symptoms \r\n                            that may require that you see your doctor immediately. \r\n                            These symptoms or signs include the following: Blood in your stool or vomit -you should call \r\n                              your doctor and let him/her know immediately Severe abdominal pain Chest pain Seizures New onset of a fever or if your fever is much \r\n                              higher than it usually is Excess bruising or bleeding anywhere on your \r\n                              body Confusion or mood changes Acombination of symptoms such as severe headache \r\n                              with neck stiffness and fever. This combination \r\n                              could be serious and you need to let your doctor \r\n                              know immediately. There are other reasons why you should call your \r\n                            doctor. For example, if the doctor has put you on \r\n                            a new medication and you've been taking it as prescribed, \r\n                            and for the period of time prescribed and your symptoms \r\n                            are no better or they are worse, you need to let the \r\n                            doctor know. How long will a flare last? How long will a remission \r\n                            last? There is no way of predicting how long a flare will \r\n                            last when it comes, nor is there any way of predicting \r\n                            how long a remission will last when it comes. It is \r\n                            frequently said about lupus that the only thing that \r\n                            is predictable about lupus is it's unpredictability. \r\n                            So we have no way of forecasting how long a flare \r\n                            will last or how long a remission will last. Sometimes \r\n                            changes in symptoms or lab tests predict future changes. I've had lupus for 2 years and haven't had a remission \r\n                            yet. Is this possible? Yes. Lupus takes a highly variable course. Some people \r\n                            will have a course where their lupus flares-up and \r\n                            then simmers down and goes into remission. On the \r\n                            other hand, some have a more chronic (long-lasting) \r\n                            course where they have a chronic state of flare and \r\n                            have symptoms day-in and day-out. < \r\n                            Back 28. What can Iexpect in the \r\n                            future? Will Ibe able to have a family? Unless there is moderate to severe organ involvement \r\n                            or if a person must take immunosuppressive/immunomodulating \r\n                            medications that would place the mother at risk, there \r\n                            is no absolute reason why a person with lupus should \r\n                            not get pregnant. You must be aware, however, that \r\n                            there is an increased risk of disease activity either \r\n                            during or three to four weeks after pregnancy and, \r\n                            therefore, all women with lupus who are pregnant must \r\n                            be closely monitored by an obstetrician who is thoroughly \r\n                            familiar with high risk pregnancy as well as their \r\n                            lupus doctor. Statistically, 50% of all lupus pregnancies \r\n                            are completely normal, 25% will deliver normal babies \r\n                            prematurely and the remaining 25% will experience \r\n                            either a miscarriage or a fetal death. Years ago women with lupus were advised not to have \r\n                            children. However, today with the advances in diagnosis \r\n                            and treatment of lupus, unless there is moderate to \r\n                            severe organ involvement, there is no absolute reason \r\n                            why a person with lupus should not get pregnant. Reference: see brochure, Pregnancy \r\n                            and Lupus Will Ibe able to continue working full-time? Many people who have lupus are able to continue working \r\n                            full-time. However, since lupus affects people to \r\n                            varying degrees there is no real way of predicting \r\n                            what your course of lupus will bring in the future. \r\n                            Some find they have to cut back to part-time or try \r\n                            modifications of their work environment or schedule, \r\n                            some find they have to take a leave of absence for \r\n                            a period of time, others may find their lupus activity \r\n                            is such that they are unable to continue with working, \r\n                            and some may go on disability. Will Ilive long enough to see my children grow \r\n                            up? The majority of people living with lupus today, in \r\n                            fact 80-90% of them, can expect to live a normal lifespan. Reference: see Facts & Overview, What \r\n                            is Lupus? Will Ibecome crippled and end up in a wheelchair? People are frequently concerned that the arthritis \r\n                            associated with lupus will result in crippling deformities. \r\n                            Lupus arthritis generally does not cause deformities \r\n                            of the joints. Occasionally, avascular necrosis of \r\n                            bone, related to steroids and lupus, may occur and \r\n                            require total hip or knee replacement surgery.

At the present time, we do not have any scientific \r\n                            data that indicates that dental fillings may act as \r\n                            a trigger of lupus.

One study indicated an association between the use \r\n                            of hair dyes and lupus symptoms, but subsequent studies \r\n                            found no association and no recent evidence has been \r\n                            reported.

How is lupus \r\n                            treated? The majority of symptoms of lupus are due to inflammation \r\n                            and so the treatment is aimed at reducing that inflammation. \r\n                            This can be done through a number of different medications. \r\n                            There are four families of medications used in the \r\n                            treatment of lupus. They include: Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs - drugs such \r\n                            as ibuprofen (Advil & Motrin), naproxen, (Naprosyn \r\n                            & Aleve), sulindac (Clinoril), piroxicam (Feldene), \r\n                            diclofenac (Voltaren) to name a few. Corticosteroids - drugs such as prednisone, prednisolone, \r\n                            medrol, deltasone, cortisone and others. Anti-malarials - these have been found to be effective \r\n                            in treating the joint pain, skin rashes and ulcers \r\n                            that some people develop on the inside of their nose \r\n                            or mouth. Plaquenil (hydroxychloroquine) is probably \r\n                            the most commonly prescribed anti-malarial drug in \r\n                            the United States. There is no known relationship \r\n                            between lupus and malaria. The fourth family of medications, immunosuppressants \r\n                            (or immunomodulating) /chemotherapy, is generally \r\n                            reserved for those individuals who have the most severe \r\n                            flares of lupus; or to enable the steroid dose to \r\n                            be reduced. Asevere flare is one that affects an \r\n                            organ to the degree that the function is impaired. \r\n                            When this happens something has to be done to preserve \r\n                            the function of the organ and that's when immunosuppressive \r\n                            or chemotherapy medications are prescribed. These \r\n                            actually suppress the over activity of the immune \r\n                            system brought on by the lupus, and help limit the \r\n                            damage and preserve the function of the involved organ. \r\n                            (Lupus is NOT a form of cancer). The majority of people who have lupus are treated with \r\n                        the first three families of medications, the nonsteroidals, \r\n                        corticosteroids and the anti-malarial drugs. These may \r\n                        be used either alone or in combination. Since individuals \r\n                        respond differently to medications, it may take time before \r\n                        you are able to determine, through trial & error, which \r\n                        medication at which dose provides relief of the symptoms \r\n                        of lupus. Frequently physicians will try one medication \r\n                        see how it works and if it doesn't work, they may have \r\n                        to change the dose or switch to another medication.

Idon't want to go on prednisone. Are there any other \r\n                        treatments available? In addition to corticosteroids, lupus can be treated with \r\n                        non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-malarial medications, \r\n                        and chemotherapy drugs. There can be situations where \r\n                        steroids are the best choice of therapy and the other \r\n                        medications are not indicated or are ineffective. What can Ido about the weight gain brought on by the \r\n                        prednisone? Increased appetite is well recognized as a side effect \r\n                        of corticosteroid therapy. Often times, just being aware \r\n                        that this increase in appetite may occur with the steroid \r\n                        therapy, is the first step towards managing the potential \r\n                        weight gain. If you have to go on steroids or if you have \r\n                        to increase your dosage of steroids, you may want to consider \r\n                        planning out a healthy diet during the time you're taking \r\n                        steroids and making sure that you stick to it. During \r\n                        those times, however, when you're really hungry, here \r\n                        are some things you can do to combat the munchies: Drink a large glass of low sodium vegetable juice \r\n                            cocktail Eat a bowl of air popped or low fat microwave popcorn Eat a plate of raw vegetables dipped in fat-free \r\n                            sour cream If you can, go for a walk Drink a cup of decaffeinated flavored coffee with \r\n                            low fat milk These are low fat substitutions, which can reduce your \r\n                        overall caloric intake and hopefully curb your weight \r\n                        gain. Taking steroids can also increase water weight gain. \r\n                        You can help to cut down the amount of fluid retention \r\n                        by reducing your sodium and/or salt intake. This can be \r\n                        accomplished by avoiding processed or convenience food \r\n                        whenever possible. If you are going to be eating convenience \r\n                        or processed foods, check the label and make sure that \r\n                        no item contains more than 200 mg of sodium per serving. \r\n                        Or if you are eating a whole frozen dinner, for example, \r\n                        try and stay between 500 and 700 mg of sodium. If you \r\n                        can avoid processed meats such as luncheon meats, sausages \r\n                        or bacon, you'll be reducing your sodium intake and that's \r\n                        good. If you have a choice among fresh, frozen or canned \r\n                        vegetables, stay away from the canned and choose fresh \r\n                        or frozen because they are lower in sodium. Support groups and commercial weight loss programs \r\n                          can assist in weight control efforts.

Do you recommend any herbs or vitamins for the treatment \r\n                          of lupus? We do not recommend any specific herbs or vitamins. \r\n                          There is a great deal of interest in herbal medicine \r\n                          and vitamin therapy. However, this is an area that really \r\n                          requires further scientific study. There are many anecdotal \r\n                          reports of people who took a certain vitamin or herb \r\n                          and felt that it helped improve their lupus. However, \r\n                          you have to be careful because some herbs have been \r\n                          shown to contain dangerous contaminants. With vitamin \r\n                          therapy, you have to be careful of not overdosing. In general if you are concerned about having adequate \r\n                          quantities of vitamins in your diet, you can take a \r\n                          single multi-vitamin per day. Calcium supplements, to \r\n                          prevent osteoporosis (bone thinning), are a good idea. \r\n                          Patients who are prescribed methotrexate are often told \r\n                          to further supplement their diet with folic acid. < \r\n                          Back 35. Where is the BEST place to \r\n                          go for diagnosis and treatment of lupus? There is no one single recognized center of excellence \r\n                          for the treatment and diagnosis of lupus in the United \r\n                          States today. The Lupus Foundation of America has no \r\n                          mechanism by which it can rate either hospitals or physicians. \r\n                          The general recommendation is to find a physician that \r\n                          is affiliated with a medical school -a university hospital \r\n                          for example. These health care institutions may have \r\n                          faculty on staff who are involved in lupus research, \r\n                          and are generally the most up-to-date on the latest \r\n                          advances in diagnosis and treatment of lupus. These \r\n                          are generally regarded as very good places to go for \r\n                          the diagnosis and treatment of lupus.

Is acupuncture helpful to \r\n                          people with lupus? There have been anecdotal reports from people stating \r\n                          that they received acupuncture and believed they benefited \r\n                          from it. This is an area of alternative medicine that \r\n                          requires further controlled scientific studies before \r\n                          we can say whether or not acupuncture is helpful in \r\n                          treating the symptoms of lupus. However, there are studies \r\n                          that show acupuncture can be effective in back pain \r\n                          and fibromyalgia.

The LFA is frequently asked about alternative therapies \r\n                          for the treatment of lupus. Although we remain hopeful \r\n                          that newer more effective therapies will be developed, \r\n                          we must be cautious regarding products that have not \r\n                          been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Remedies that have not undergone \r\n                          the scrutiny of scientific investigation, lack the crucial \r\n                          information and data necessary to enable physicians \r\n                          to make sound recommendations regarding substances. Evaluation of medications/products by the scientific \r\n                          method is at the present time the best way to prove \r\n                          effectiveness and safety. We urge people with lupus \r\n                          to ask the manufacturer/distributor of any product: \r\n                          what is their proof, other than testimonial, that the \r\n                          product is safe and effective for lupus? If the product \r\n                          has not been approved by the FDA, we cannot vouch for \r\n                          the claims made for the purity, safety, or effectiveness \r\n                          of these substances. Some products may have unlabeled \r\n                          substances such as alfalfa or sulfa that may be harmful \r\n                          to patients with lupus.

Lupus Research Is any research being done on lupus? Yes, there is a good deal of interest in lupus. Research \r\n                          can be divided into two types: basic or clinical. Much \r\n                          of the lupus research is considered to be basic, where \r\n                          scientists attempt to develop or refine theories (concepts, \r\n                          beliefs, principles) of how the body works and how the \r\n                          immune system functions. Basic research is conducted \r\n                          in the laboratory and generally does not involve the \r\n                          use of human subjects. We are lucky to have animal models \r\n                          of SLE (mice with lupus) so that research into the cause \r\n                          of lupus and better treatments can be investigated more \r\n                          easily. Clinical research involves the study of humans and how \r\n                          they act or react to certain factors. It includes applying \r\n                          or testing theories and evaluating their usefulness \r\n                          in solving clinical problems. Each year the American College of Rheumatology publishes \r\n                          a listing of summaries (abstracts) of research projects. \r\n                          In a typical year, there are over 200 research abstracts \r\n                          listed that pertain to lupus. The majority of the studies \r\n                          are basic research. Published research studies can be \r\n                          found using the National Library of Medicine's PubMed \r\n                          web site: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed/ Currently, we are aware of many ongoing clinical studies \r\n                          involving people with lupus and their families. Alist \r\n                          of studies is available in the Clinical \r\n                          Trials section of this site. Clinical research can be divided into two broad areas: \r\n                          testing of new therapies and research to expand our \r\n                          understanding of different aspects of lupus. There are \r\n                          several genetic linkage studies in lupus (see question \r\n                          18 ) that will help to identify genes that determine \r\n                          susceptibility to the disease. We are also aware of \r\n                          multi-centered clinical trials that are evaluating DHEA, \r\n                          a male hormone, to see if it can improve clinical outcome \r\n                          and disease symptoms in women and men with systemic \r\n                          lupus. There are also clinical trials being conducted \r\n                          using Toleragens,™ which are molecules designed \r\n                          to tolerize or shut-off Bcells (antibody producing \r\n                          white blood cells) that produce Anti-DNA antibodies. \r\n                          Anti-DNA antibodies are felt to be responsible for causing \r\n                          many of the symptoms of SLE, especially kidney disease. \r\n                          It is hoped that suppression of these antibodies will \r\n                          result in improvement of disease activity and decrease \r\n                          the need for immunosuppressive therapies. These are \r\n                          just a few of the many areas of lupus research under \r\n                          investigation.

In April 1994, NIAMS announced the establishment of \r\n                          the first two Specialized Centers of Research (SCORs) \r\n                          in systemic lupus erythematosus; the Hospital for Special \r\n                          Surgery, Cornell Medical Center in New York City, and \r\n                          the University of North Carolina, in Chapel Hill. A \r\n                          SCOR is envisioned as a national resource associated \r\n                          with one or more major medical complexes and dedicated \r\n                          to working with the NIAMS in furthering the research \r\n                          effort to translate basic research to clinical application. \r\n                          Federally funded research at these specialized centers \r\n                          permits basic and clinical researchers to work together \r\n                          to focus on one disease.

What do we now know as a result of NIAMS supported research? \r\n                          Asynopsis of progress in lupus research is available \r\n                          in the booklet: Progress \r\n                          and Promise - NIAMS 15th Anniversary Booklet Are there any studies on the use of estrogen in lupus? In January 1996, NIAMS announced the beginning of the \r\n                          first clinical trial on the safety of estrogen in lupus \r\n                          erythematosus. The clinical trial, known as SELENA, \r\n                          (Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National \r\n                          Assessment) is being funded by NIAMS, the NIH Office \r\n                          of Research on Women's Health and the NIH Office of \r\n                          Research on Minority Health. Several major research \r\n                          centers in twelve states are collaborating in this randomized \r\n                          double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine: 1. the effects of oral contraceptives on disease activity \r\n                          and severity in SLE. This will show whether it is safe \r\n                          for women with SLE to use the Pill. 2. whether the hormone estrogen can be used by postmenopausal \r\n                          women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). The study \r\n                          will look at the effects of estrogen replacement therapy \r\n                          on the activity and severity of SLE.

NIAMS Registries for Lupus and Lupus Related Conditions Lupus Registry and Repository In early 1996, the NIAMS established the Lupus Registry \r\n                          and Repository to study people with lupus, and their \r\n                          families in order to identify genes that determine susceptibility \r\n                          to the disease. The high prevalence of lupus among relatives \r\n                          of lupus patients suggests a genetic component for the \r\n                          disease. However, genetic studies of lupus to date have \r\n                          been incomplete. The Lupus Registry and Repository is \r\n                          located at the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation \r\n                          in Oklahoma City, OK. Dr. John Harley directs this extensive project. He and \r\n                          his associates collect and update clinical, demographic \r\n                          and laboratory data on all patients with lupus and their \r\n                          families for the Lupus Registry. Blood, cells, and DNA \r\n                          from these individuals are stored in the Lupus Repository \r\n                          for genetic testing. They are seeking lupus patients who have two or more \r\n                          family members who have been diagnosed with the disease. \r\n                          Families who qualify for the study receive a blood sample \r\n                          collection kit, a consent form and a questionnaire. \r\n                          Ablood sample is collected and completed materials \r\n                          are sent to Dr. Harley and his associates for evaluation. \r\n                          Patients or physicians interested in participating should \r\n                          contact: Carisa Cooney, Kurt Downing, Jessica Lombard or a Recruiter Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Lupus Multiplex Registry & Repository 825 NE 13th Street, MS #5 Oklahoma City, OK 73104 1-888-655-8787 (1-888-OK-LUPUS) or (405) 271-7479 http://omrf.ouhsc.edu/lupus Neonatal Lupus Registry Dr. Jill Buyon is the director of the NIAMS/HJD Neonatal \r\n                          Lupus Registry.

Just as an automobile mechanic \r\n                          must understand how a car engine works before he/she \r\n                          can fix it, we must have a broader and more in-depth \r\n                          understanding of how the immune system works before \r\n                          we can find the cure. We must also continue to look \r\n                          for other causes such as a virus that can cause lupus. Through research, we establish new knowledge and a better \r\n                          understanding of how the immune system functions. Our \r\n                          knowledge is incomplete, but we don't know how much \r\n                          more we need before we will fully understand what goes \r\n                          wrong in lupus and why. So, we don't know how close \r\n                          we are to a cure because we don't know really where \r\n                          the finish line is. There is a great deal of interest \r\n                          within the scientific community in mastering all the \r\n                          complexities of the immune system. Because of this, \r\n                          there is hope that we will one day understand just precisely \r\n                          what goes wrong with lupus and why. This will be a major \r\n                          step in the process of finding the cure. < \r\n                          Back WORK - INSURANCE - DISABILITY 40.

Can people with lupus qualify \r\n                          for Social Security Disability? Lupus affects everyone differently. Not everyone is \r\n                          disabled by lupus. Adiagnosis of lupus does not automatically \r\n                          entitle a person to disability benefits. The Social \r\n                          Security Administration recognizes systemic lupus erythematosus \r\n                          as a potentially disabling illness and includes SLE \r\n                          in their listing of impairments. What do Ineed to do to apply? First, ask your doctor if in his/her opinion you are \r\n                          disabled according to the definition used by the Social \r\n                          Security Administration. Disability definition: the inability to engage \r\n                          in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any \r\n                          medically determinable physical or mental impairment \r\n                          which can be expected to result in death or which has \r\n                          lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period \r\n                          of not less than 12 months. Second, contact your nearest Social Security Administration \r\n                          office and request all information (brochures/pamphlets) \r\n                          and forms to apply for SSDI (Social Security Disability \r\n                          Insurance). They are listed in your phone book. You \r\n                          also can call their toll-free number, 1-800-772-1213, \r\n                          between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. any business day. Information is also available online at: Social Security \r\n                          Disability Program: Disability Information How do Iknow if Iam eligible for Social Security \r\n                          Disability? SSDI is an insurance plan supported through payroll \r\n                          deduction (FICA withholding tax) that covers most workers \r\n                          in the U.S. Eligibility is based on prior work. You \r\n                          must be under age 65 and have worked long enough and \r\n                          recently enough to be eligible to apply. The Social \r\n                          Security Administration's web site has a Benefit \r\n                          Eligibility Screening Tool ( BEST ) \r\n                          that can help you identify all the benefits you may \r\n                          be eligible for. What if Iam disabled but have not worked long enough \r\n                          or recently enough to be eligible for SSDI? There \r\n                          is another disability program, Supplemental Security \r\n                          Income (SSI), which provides benefits to the needy and \r\n                          disabled who have not worked long enough or recently \r\n                          enough to be eligible for SSDI. I've heard that it is almost impossible to get disability. \r\n                          Is this true? Applying for and receiving Social \r\n                          Security Disability can be difficult and time consuming; \r\n                          it can take up to a year or longer. You must prove your \r\n                          disability. It requires work on your part to manage \r\n                          your claim and to make sure that your application is \r\n                          COMPLETE. It is crucial that you provide thorough information \r\n                          so the people who review your claim fully understand \r\n                          the impact your lupus, and other illnesses, have on \r\n                          your ability to work, and your ability to perform daily \r\n                          functions at home. The Social Security Administration \r\n                          (SSA) must justify the disability payments they make. \r\n                          If the forms submitted do not prove to their satisfaction \r\n                          that you are disabled, then the SSA can not justify \r\n                          paying benefits, and you will be denied. On the other \r\n                          hand, a claim that is well documented and supported \r\n                          with complete information likely will provide the justification \r\n                          needed for payment of benefits. If you are denied, do not take it personally. Adenial \r\n                          is only a notice that the information you provided does \r\n                          not prove you are disabled. There is an appeals process. \r\n                          We encourage everyone to follow thorough with the appeal. \r\n                          It is an opportunity for you to submit further information \r\n                          to prove you are disabled.

I've just been denied disability benefits by Social \r\n                          Security. What do Ido? Don't take it personally. \r\n                          Adenial is only a notice that the information you provided \r\n                          so far does not prove you are disabled.

If your first appeal is denied, then you can pursue \r\n                          a second appeal where you will have a hearing before \r\n                          an administrative law judge. We generally recommend \r\n                          that if you progress to this level that you have an \r\n                          attorney familiar with disability law represent you.
