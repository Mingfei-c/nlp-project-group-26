      "text": "Posted: Jun 19, 2003 - 03:19 PM First, Overall configuration: If Ihave 2 workspaces in my environment and then install MyEclipse, one of them is never properly configured (and apparently can't be).  The Winddows->Preferences stuff is there, but there is no MyEclipse menu or toolbar entry and there is no launcher button. Next: JBoss and Oracle Creating a web project for standalone Ovacle (OC4J) has an assumed structure that is different from JBoss (at least).  The project template from J2EE in Myeclipse should be on the Server level (in my opinion) since the various app servers have such widely varying forms.  In addition, since at least JBoss (and probably WebLogic and WebSphere as well)  require additional xml files required to deploy to those environments, the templates should include those items in the structure (including empty defaults with appropriate dtd - at least referenced). Next: Shutdown does not work for Oracle.  Ican do it with admin.jar (so it is not horrible), but it is annoying to have to do it.  both userid and password are required to propeerly shutdown using admin.jar from Oracle.  The problem is that the hanging server instance for a new user makes the software look amateurish. Finally: Even if this stuff can't get in to the upcoming release, someone should spend a couple of hours writing something beyond the tiny bit that is written  here.  There is virtually nothing written about Oracle."

Little things like what JNDI names you want your EJB's to have, etc. :-)  Fortunately, the names for these server-specific files don't seem to collide with each other from vendor to vendor so you can have them all in one project and the server you deploy on will only read the standard descriptors plus the ones for that server.
