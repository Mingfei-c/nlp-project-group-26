But we all Relay toward the \r\nsame outcome. Hope drives us all, and we derive our inspiration from the stories \r\nand faith of others. \"Because of YOU... lives are saved, lives are changed.\" The \r\nreason why I Relay is to preserve the memory of my Uncle Wallace Campbell, to \r\nhonor my mother, Myrtle Pake, for her battle and survival of breast cancer and \r\nmy father, Dennis Pake, who has had melanoma. I also Relay for you so that \r\nhopefully you will not ever hear those terrible words You have cancer. I Relay \r\nto raise funds for research, advocacy and patient support programs. I love \r\nfighting for a cure for cancer, bringing hope. The American \r\nCancer Society is at work in communities all across the country providing \r\nprograms aimed at reducing the risk of cancer, detecting cancer as early as \r\npossible, ensuring proper treatment, and empowering people facing cancer to cope \r\nand maintain the highest possible quality of life. I am extremely passionate \r\nabout Relay and seeing this fight to the end. I joined the staff of the American \r\nCancer Society in December 2004 and will happily lose the job of my dreams \r\nbecause of the ultimate goal: finding a cure for cancer. With God as our main \r\nsupporter and each one of us, one day soon the dreaded C word Cancer will be \r\njust another word in our history books. We all have our stories. What is yours?

      "text": "On August 11, 1997, I experienced the worst day of my life \r\n(or so I thought). My 7 year old son Christopher was diagnosed with \r\nNon-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I always thought this was something that happened to \r\nother people. I couldn't believe this was happening to \"MY\" child. I found out \r\nthen, and many times since, that it can happen to anyone. As it turns out, May \r\n10, 2001 was the worst day of my life. After a 4 year courageous battle, my \r\n\"baby\" lost his battle with that dreaded disease. With Christopher as my inspiration, I \"Relay\" so that some \r\nday, other children and their parents do not have to experience the horrible \r\ndisease of cancer and what it does to you physically and emotionally. I don't \r\nwant any child to have to go through what my son went through and I don't want \r\nany parent to have to experience the loss of a child. For me, participating in the Relay for Life helps to make \r\nsomething positive out of something so very negative. I am confident some day \r\nthere will be a cure for cancer, and I will have the satisfaction of knowing \r\nthat I played a very small part in it. Claire Wilson, Committee Co-Chair"

My dad wasn't alive for some of the most important parts of my \r\nlife..he never met my husband, nor was he there for my wedding or the birth of \r\nmy daughter.  I do believe that he WAS with me through it all.  I feel that I am \r\ngiving something back to my father by doing the Relay.  It makes me feel worth \r\nwhile and I know that he would be so proud.

To this day I havent forgotten what she went \r\nthrough and the feeling of total helplessness my family felt because there \r\nwasnt a cure to save our mother.  Since that time, weve lost a dear aunt and \r\nuncle to cancer and, although it was not the cause of his death, my dad had \r\nprostate cancer when he passed away in May 2001.  These are ALL Reasons for me \r\nto Relay, and whatever small part I play in raising money for cancer research is \r\na labor of love in memory of these very special people.

      "text": "CANCER---this six letter word brings such fear and \r\nheartache to so many.  My first response as to \"Why I Relay\" is to say to find a \r\ncure!  Secondly, I'm reminded of the moments in my life that have been touched \r\nby cancer (my mother-in-law surviving breast cancer, my own scare with a \r\nsuspicious lump, and the death of two mothers this year in my son's 6th grade \r\nclass). When I was asked last year to walk in the \r\nPittsboro Relay for Life my first thought raced to the death of a dear friend's \r\nson.   I don't even live in Pittsboro and my immediate response was YES, sign me \r\nup.  The ache in my heart I feel each time I see my friend eases somewhat when I \r\nsee all of the Relay teams working so hard to raise money for the American \r\nCancer Society.  Working together we are all making a difference----no matter \r\nhow big or how small the contribution. If you ever question why you do this or you become \r\ntired of asking for donations or selling this and that...stop for a minute and \r\nthink of what others have lost and remind yourself that it could have been your \r\nmother, your child, or your best friend who lost their battle.   All of the work \r\nwe do is for those who did not survive and for those who will!

In fact, I even signed all my cards to her \"From your favorite \r\nGrand-daughter Kay.\"  You know it takes someone very special to make each one of \r\nus feel so special. In January 2000 my Grandmother was diagnosed with \r\nrenal cancer.  She died one month to the day of her diagnosis, February 14, 2000 \r\n- Valentine's Day.  She accepted what God had given her, but I had a much harder \r\ntime letting go.  I made a choice to try and do something to honor her \r\nmemory...I just couldn't let her slip away!  Cancer may have struck my \r\nGrandmother physically, but it actually attacked our entire family - leaving a \r\nhole where she used to be.  But the Lord is always good and works in mysterious \r\nways and I responded to a request for volunteers for Pittsboro's first annual \r\nRelay for Life which was a HUGE success! Now I'd be lying to myself if I ended the story \r\nthere...my primary reason was to honor my own Grandmother, but there is so much \r\nmore now.  Since being involved with the Relay, I have realized the number of \r\nfriends, family, co-workers, etc., that have had their lives touched and \r\ndestroyed in some way by cancer...and I too have had my own scares more than \r\nonce.  I only needed to see the bald head on ONE child to pull at my heart \r\nstrings, I only needed to hear the cry of ONE parent in sorrow so deep that \r\nno-one - not anyone - could comfort, I only once needed to see the tears of my \r\nparents at the news of a loss of a friend (and there have been several) due to \r\ncancer.  And I have only ONCE had to feel the helplessness of not being able to \r\nhelp someone I care about.  I Relay because I do believe there is a cure and \r\nthat we are so close to finding it...and I am helping in some small way to find \r\nit!  I Relay because I refuse to let this disease to take control and just sit \r\nback and watch!  I Relay because I can....how could you not?

      "text": "In 2003, I relayed with The Survivors just to do something to help. This \r\nyear, I wanted to make a bigger difference, so I decided to form a team of my \r\nown. Then in November, I was given an even bigger reason. My mom was diagnosed \r\nwith breast cancer. I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me. But, \r\nI knew we had work to do and I had to be brave and have a deeper faith than ever \r\nbefore. I thank the Lord everyday because the cancer was removed and now she is \r\ngoing through radiation treatments. My mom is a survivor! I am co-captain of Bells Angels, from Bells Baptist church. Our church has \r\nbeen hit hard by cancer over the past few years. I felt that if any church \r\ncongregation had a reason to relay, it's us. So, together with Jennifer \r\nChambers, we put a team together. I just wanted to help....no matter how much we raise, I just want to help \r\nfight this disease. There is a cure out there, we just have to keep looking. To \r\nsteal a quote from the late Jim Valvano, \"Don't give up; don't ever, ever give \r\nup.\" Gail \r\nBlackwood Bells Baptist Church Team Captain msthemeseparator I became involved in Relay because the profound effect that \r\nCancer had on my family. I had always thought of my Gramps as Superman. He was never sick, always had \r\nenergy, loved to Fish, play with his grandchildren, travel and teach us life's \r\nlessons. When he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, I was crushed. If cancer \r\ncould strike this man who I thought was indestructible, who next. Unfortunately, \r\nhe lost his fight with cancer more than ten years ago. We all miss him dearly. I \r\nRelay in his memory! My Brother, George, was also struck with cancer several years ago. I had a hard \r\ntime dealing with his illness. I stayed away because I just didn't know what to \r\nsay or do or even how to act. I will never be able to forgive myself for that \r\nbecause he needed his family during that time. He recovered and is in full \r\nremission. I Relay in his Honor! Won't you join me in the Fight! Julie Payne Synergistics Team Captain msthemeseparator My involvement in Relay For Life was initiated by a \"cold call\" from Carol \r\nEsau in 2003 to form a team from our church. I had not been involved in the \r\nfirst Relay For Life event, but had heard wonderful things about it. I took the \r\nchallenge, and it turned out to be one of the most meaningful things I have done \r\nin my life. When cancer strikes someone you love there is not much you can do \r\nbut pray, and be supportive. I lost my grandfather to colon cancer, my \r\ngrandmother was a breast cancer survivor, my father is a melanoma survivor, two \r\ncousins died of melanoma at ages 41 and 51, and I have another cousin in her \r\nfight with breast cancer, and it does not stop there. My best friend from \r\ncollege days has a 7 year old daughter who was diagnosed at age 4 with liver \r\ncancer. She is in her third year after her transplant and doing great! At our church alone we have lost several wonderful church members to cancer. \r\nWe do have cancer survivors in our church and I Relay for them with the hope \r\nthat they will be with us for a long, long time. It makes me feel good to know \r\nthat the money we raise at Relay filters into the lives of survivors at some \r\npoint in time. My hope is that through this fundraising future generations will \r\nhave alternatives for treatment and a higher success rate for a cure. Everyone \r\nis affected by cancer at some time in their life.  Our stories are about \r\ndifferent people with the same disease, cancer. If you get a call to participate in Relay ...\"just do it\", everything else \r\nwill speak for itself. Terry Whitfield, The Angel Band - Mt. Pleasant \r\nUnited Methodist Church msthemeseparator The Pittsboro Relay for \r\nLife committee is saddened at the loss of Bonita Cumbie who died as a result of \r\na tragic head on collision on March 4th, 2005.  Our deepest sympathy goes \r\nout to her family.  Bonita was one of our newest committee members and had \r\nbeen a team captain for The Olive Branches from Mt. Olive Baptist Church for the \r\nlast 3 years. Donations in Bonita's \r\nmemory can be made out to American Cancer Society and sent with a note that says \r\n\"In Memory of Bonita\" to P. O. Box 874, Pittsboro, NC 27312.  We will send \r\nan acknowledgement to her family and money raised will be credited to The Olive \r\nBranches Team. msthemeseparator I'm not a participant from Pittsboro, I \"Relay\" in Cheshire, \r\nCT, but I saw your site and wanted to let you know why I Relay. I hope you don't \r\nmind me taking up some of your space. I Relay for my grandmother that I never \r\nknew because she died from cancer before I was even born, I've been told that I \r\nget my red hair and my love of reading from her, but I'll never know. I Relay \r\nfor Nick, one of the first friends I can remember, he had leukemia. I remember \r\nhim not having any hair and always wearing a fireman's hat, he never got to grow \r\nup, he died at the age of 11. I Relay for my aunt who is a breast cancer \r\nsurvivor, she is my proof that this disease can be beaten. I Relay for my uncle, \r\nwho I named my team after, The Corriveau Crusaders, he survived stomach cancer, \r\nonly to succumb to pancreatic cancer a year later. There have been others in my \r\nlife who fought their battles with cancer, a friend's uncle, a teacher, a \r\nneighbor, some have won, others have lost. The wound that is still the freshest \r\nand the most painful is the one caused by the loss of \"Pa\". Pa was my surrogate \r\ngrandfather, since I never had one of my own, he was my friend's grandfather and \r\nI lived next to him my entire life. He was an amazing man to everyone who knew \r\nhim. He had lung cancer and had had portions of lung removed years earlier, it \r\nfinally caught up to him and he died last March 2004. I Relay so I can do my \r\npart to eradicate this awful disease.
