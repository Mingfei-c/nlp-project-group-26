Buy a brand that you are familiar with (or someone else has recommended to you). Check for quality marks, i.e., BEAB (British Electrical Approvals Board). Ensure the appliance is big enough to suit your individual and family needs. Check that the appliance has a guarantee and even an after-sales service. Compare several different appliances and consult 'Consumer Choice' magazine for an unbiased report on the appliance. The appliance should carry an 'Energy Efficiency' label. This should be on top or in front of the model on display in the shop. The scale goes from Ato Gwith Abeing the most energy efficient (sometimes up to 55% better than the Grating). The appliance should be well-designed, with no sharp edges or difficult handles."

As the appliance cools, the bi-metallic strip straightens up and makes contact again thereby reconnecting the circuit and the appliance is automatically heat controlled.

      "text": "Large Appliances A. Refrigerator The working principle of a refrigerator Heat is removed from food and the surrounding area, thereby creating an environment which retards the activity of microorganisms. Temperature is usually about 5°C. Arefrigerant is used to remove the heat, i.e., a highly sensitive liquid which converts easily into a gas and back again into a liquid, e.g., freon12 or ammonia. The refrigerant is carried in tubes at the back of the appliance and around the icebox. The electric motor activates the compressor in the appliance which forces a gaseous refrigerant in the compressor into the condenser. In the condenser the refrigerant changes into a liquid, heat from the food in the refrigerator is absorbed by the liquid refrigerant and converts it back into a gas, ready for the cycle to begin again. In so doing, the food is cooled. The refrigerator is thermostatically controlled to ensure an even temperature. Construction of a refrigerator The outer case is made of enameled steel and the lining is made of plastic, with layers of insulation between them. The door is magnetically sealed. The star marking rating is on the icebox and this refers to the temperature in the icebox and the length of time pre-frozen food can be stored in it."

      "text": "B. Washing machine There are many different types of washing machine available, the most popular being the fully automatic top or front loader. The wash programme can be controlled to suit different fabrics and degrees of soiling. Arange of programmes exists, from normal wash, rinse and spin to soak, economy and half-load. The machines are usually plumbed in, i.e., permanently connected to a water and electrical supply. Working principle of washing machines Low foam detergents lower the surface tension of water and allow the clothes to become wet. The hydrophobic part of the detergent attaches itself to the dirt and the hydrophylic part of the detergent attaches itself to the water. Amotor causes the drum to rotate in half revolutions, causing the clothes to be tossed from side to side. Athermostat heats the water to a temperature suitable for the fabric and the degree of soiling, i.e., 40°Cfor normal washing and 90°Cfor heavy soiled cotton. The soiled water is drained out of the machine through the perforated drum and empties into the waste pipe. The drum is filled again with cold water and the clothes are rinsed (usually two or three rinses). The machine is emptied and begins to revolve at high speed, exerting centrifugal force on the contents (the clothes are forced against the perforated drum and water is squeezed out of them). Construction of a washing machine: The outer casing is made of enameled pressed steel. There is a glass door with a rubber ring to make it waterproof and a safety lock to prevent it being opened when the machine is in operation. Inside is a perforated stainless steel drum. Amotor rotates the drum and a thermostat heats the water. Apump controls the water input and output. Typically, a washing machine can accommodate three or four kilograms of dry clothes and measures 60cm X 60cm X 80cm. Care and cleaning"

      "text": "Textiles Clothing is just one of the uses of textiles in the home. Others include bed linen, soft furnishings, towels and tea cloths. The desirable properties of textiles are: · absorbent · cool · durable (wears well) · insulating (keeps in the heat and the cold out) · resilient (creases fall out easily) · soft · stain and water resistant · mildew resistant · colour does not bleed · hard -wearing The undesirable properties of textiles are: · easily creased · irritates the skin · becomes bally or pills · shrinks · stains easily · flammable Awide variety of care symbols are printed on labels of textile articles to assist the consumer in how to care for them. These symbols are used on laundry detergents as well. Fibres can be divided into two groups. A. Natural fibres include: · Wool — when wet, it absorbs 30% of its own moisture and needs to be dried flat. It needs to be washed gently to avoid shrinkage. · Silk — it needs great care when washing as it becomes weak with water. · Cotton — it can tolerate high temperatures, is strong when wet and washes well in the washing machine. It is absorbent and wears very well, making it suitable for work wear and soft furnishings. · Linen — it is very strong when wet but creases easily . B. Man-made fibres include: · Nylon — it wears well and creases fall out easily. It dries quickly but is not absorbent. · Polyester — it wears well and creases fall out easily. · Acrylic — this fabric washes well and does not shrink. It wears well and is very light. By law, children's clothes and upholstery fabric must be given a flame-retardant finish such as Proban. The Fire Safety (Domestic Furniture) Order 1988 regulates the type of filling and the textiles to be used in the covering of home furnishings. Products must carry two labels, one free-hanging and the other permanently attached.
