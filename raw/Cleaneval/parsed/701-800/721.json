      "text": "SRIM is a\r\ncollection of software packages which calculate many\r\nfeatures of the transport of ions in matter. Typical\r\napplications include: Ion Stopping and Range in Targets: Most aspects of the energy\r\nloss of ions in matter are calculated in SRIM , \r\n    the Stopping and Range\r\nof Ions in Matter.\r\n    SRIM\r\nincludes quick calculations which produce tables of stopping powers, range\r\n    and straggling distributions for any ion at any energy\r\n    in any elemental target. More elaborate calculations\r\n    include targets with complex multi-layer configurations. Ion Implantation : Ion beams are used to modify samples by\r\ninjecting atoms to change the target chemical and electronic properties. The\r\nion beam also causes damage to solid targets by atom displacement. Most of the\r\nkinetic effect s associated with the physics of this kind of interactions are\r\nfound in the SRIM package. Sputtering: The ion beam may knock out target atoms, a process\r\ncalled ion sputtering . The calculation of sputtering, by any ion at\r\nany energy, is included in the SRIM package. Ion\r\n    Transmission: Ion beams can be followed through\r\n    mixed gas/solid target layers, such as occurs in\r\n    ionization chambers or in energy degrader blocks used to\r\n    reduce ion beam energies. Ion Beam\r\n    Therapy: Ion beams are widely used in medical\r\n    therapy, especially in radiation oncology. Typical\r\n    applications are included."

      "text": "The science of\r\nion beams goes back almost a century to the earliest\r\nexplanations of radioactive particles transiting thin films\r\n(1904).\r\nThe field is so rich that it is difficult for a non-expert\r\nto understand any of the current papers in the field. But\r\nbasically,  the stopping of ions in matter\r\ncan not be calculated from first principles. Hidden in\r\nstopping\r\ntheories are parameters which normalize calculated stopping\r\npowers to existing data. The \" Science \"\r\nsection of SRIM will review the basic theories of the stopping of ions in\r\nmatter. Then some of the major parameters are reviewed and\r\nit will be shown how they are derived from experimental\r\ndata. Examples are shell corrections , mean\r\nionization potentials, the effective charge of ions and the Fermi velocity of solids . Over 2000 papers\r\nhave been published in the experimental stopping of ions in\r\nsolids. Experimental measurements of stopping powers is a\r\ndifficult task, and there is wide variation in the results..\r\nPlots will show how existing stopping\r\ncalculations compare to experimental data from these\r\npapers.  Since the stopping calculations are based in\r\ngreat part on theory, the interpolation of stopping powers between various\r\nions and targets is often more accurate than individual\r\nmeasurements, especially for difficult targets.

      "text": "Buttons in Green are not yet active. Although this subject is more about the effects of energetic hadrons on\r\nterrestrial electronics than about ion beams, it is scientifically in a similar\r\nfield (hadrons = protons, neutrons and pions, i.e. particles which respond to\r\nthe nuclear force / strong interaction). The science and technology about\r\ncosmic ray induced soft fails was considered proprietary by IBM for more than\r\n15 years. In 1996, a complete issue of the IBM Journal of Research and\r\nDevelopment was devoted to reviewing this work. Asummary of the issue, and\r\nthe complete first article (the 15 year history of the development of the IBM\r\nscientific understanding of soft fails from radiation) is given\r\nat IBM J. R.& D. The scientific\r\nhistory of  this field is reviewed in detail. The field\r\nis not static because the technology of integrated circuits\r\nis still rapidly changing and the effects of cosmic rays on\r\nintegrated circuits (ICs) show trends which are not well\r\nunderstood. The trends in the sensitivity of ICs to cosmic\r\nrays are reviewed for SRAMs, DRAMs and logic over the last\r\n15 years. Fundamental to\r\nany estimates of the fail rate of ICs is an understanding of\r\nthe ambient flux of cosmic rays in the environment. As this\r\nflux has been investigated over the last 15 years, it has\r\nbecome fuzzier rather than more precise. Previous\r\nmeasurements of the ambient flux which were considered\r\nreliable have been shown to be suspect. New measurements\r\nrarely agree with past measurements. Recent reports of the flux of sea level\r\ncosmic ray hadrons vary by more than 10x, even though they\r\nwere performed by highly competent scientists. The problem will\r\nprobably be resolved by understanding that the immediate\r\nmaterials nearby an experiment can have significant effect\r\non the measured flux. The field of\r\nthe terrestrial flux of cosmic rays will be reviewed. (Return\r\nto Top)"

      "text": "This package contains programs for the analysis of data from ion scattering\r\nexperiments (called Rutherford Backscattering Spectroscopy, RBS ),\r\nand analysis of data from target sputtering experiments (called Elastic\r\nRecoil Detection, ERD ). In general, the package is applicable to any\r\nion, at any energy in any target material. It is written in a windows-based\r\nenvironment with a full graphics user interface (GUI) for analysis of complex\r\nspectra using mouse-based input. The software contains a full 32-bit\r\ninstruction set to minimize computer delay in calculating simulations. The software is written in a language called APL, which is a multi-window\r\nGUI application language particularly forgiving of mistakes. Since IBA analysis\r\nis so complex, and covers any ion at any energy for any target, it is\r\nparticularly difficult to ma ke a program which will not get confused by user\r\nrequests. APL allows the user to immediately recover with just two key strokes,\r\nwithout reloading any code or data, and continue executing the analysis from\r\nthe point of error. The required APL compiler is available for both Win-95 and\r\nOS/2 systems (see the Installation Manual for details). For details on the APL\r\nenvironment for scientific programming, see the website: http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/apl/apl2.html . The APL\r\ncompiler is normally very expensive (about $1500) but it is\r\navailable with \"educational discounts\" from IBM\r\nsales. The software requires the full APL package and will\r\nnot work with any of the stripped down versions of APL. The package has\r\nbeen used by many groups and is relatively bug-free.\r\nHowever, this software is no longer supported by the\r\nauthor . Below are links\r\nto (a) an Introduction to the IBA software, (b) Installation\r\nrequirements for the software, and (c) Samples of IBA\r\napplications. The sample IBA\r\nfigures show some of the capabilities of the IBA package. These figures\r\ncome from the IBA Tutorial Manual."
