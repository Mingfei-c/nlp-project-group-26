      "text": "What is Land Tax? Land Tax is an annual tax based on land ownership and usage of land as at 30 June. Revenue from Land Tax is paid into the general revenue account of the South Australian Government, and assists in the provision of public services such as education, health and public safety. Who is liable for the payment of Land Tax? The owner of the property as at 30 June is liable to pay the land tax assessed for the new financial year. The owner is generally taken to be the person whose name appears on the Certificate of Title at the Land Titles Office. As Land Tax is calculated as at 30 June, the Notice for Payment will contain details of properties owned as at that time. Where a property was sold after 30 June, the vendor (seller) is still liable for the land tax. However, it should be noted, if the Land Tax is not paid at settlement it remains a first charge on the land and may be passed on to the purchaser. It is an industry based convention for the legal real estate contract to provide for land tax to be apportioned (based on a calculation of the single holding tax see single and multiple holding tax ) between the buyer and seller of land. How is Land Tax calculated? The Land Tax Notice for Payment is calculated on the basis of the total site value of all land owned (either solely or jointly) as at midnight 30 June, excluding exempt land. (see what land is exempt from land tax ) It should be noted that where an owner owns more than one taxable property, land tax is calculated on the total site value of all properties owned. (For examples of calculation of land tax, see single and multiple holding tax ). What are the Land Tax Rates? Land tax is  calculated according to the following:"
