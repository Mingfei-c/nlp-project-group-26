Call your local paper with the information, \r\n                      citing it as a good nature story for the community. Conduct \r\n                      a photography contest at your school focusing on animals. \r\n                      Ask a local newspaper photographer to judge. Develop \r\n                      a nature themed bulletin board at your school. Arrange \r\n                      for a school poster contest with an environmental or wildlife \r\n                      theme. Make \r\n                      a bird feeder. Use various shapes and seed types to attract \r\n                      different species.  Keep a journal so you can identify \r\n                      feeding patterns as they emerge. Study \r\n                      animals classified as endangered species; collect pictures \r\n                      of them; study them; discuss why they are endangered and \r\n                      what can be done to help save them. Leaf \r\n                      collection - Collect as many leaves as possible. Identify \r\n                      them; trace them; make a collage. How many different species \r\n                      of trees are in your area? Make an album by putting leaves \r\n                      in a plastic photo album and labeling them."

Start \r\n                      a composting pile at your school. Make \r\n                      a worm bin to dispose of your garbage. Conduct a waste audit at your school. Find out what can \r\n                      be recycled, what is being recycled and what more can be \r\n                      recycled. Lobby your school board to buy products made from recycled \r\n                      materials (e.g. Recycled copier paper). If you do not have curbside collection for recyclables in \r\n                      your community, campaign to have drop-off areas designated. Organize a \"Take the Pledge Not to Litter\" campaign \r\n                      in your school to reduce litter. Work with your local business community to provide attractive \r\n                      litter and recycling containers.   Obtain merchants' \r\n                      agreement to empty the containers with their trash or recyclables. Become a litter basket for a day. Attach a brown bag to \r\n                      your clothing and collect any litter you encounter at your \r\n                      school.   At the end of the day, put on a pair of gloves \r\n                      to examine the litter. Decide what can be recycled, composted, \r\n                      trashed or eliminated. (Caution children not to pick up \r\n                      unusual looking or hazardous waste.)"

Arrange \r\n                      a visit to your local sewage treatment plant to increase \r\n                      your knowledge of how sewage is treated. Plant \r\n                      a vegetable garden using old egg cartons to start your seeds. Investigate \r\n                      if businesses and industries in your area have an environmental \r\n                      policy. lnvite \r\n                      your school custodial staff to speak about the cleaning \r\n                      products they use. Try to find substitutes to replace those \r\n                      your research identifies as toxic or hazardous. Develop \r\n                      an environmental newsletter for your school. Find out how water pollution affects us. Have the children \r\n                      pour an inch of red food coloring into a glass. Then have \r\n                      them pour one inch of water into the glass. Stand a stalk \r\n                      of celery or a white flower into the glass. Let it stand \r\n                      overnight to see how the plant has absorbed the red water. \r\n                      Polluted water is absorbed in plants the same way. Discuss \r\n                      with the children how we can reduce the amount of pollutants \r\n                      getting into our plants and eventually to us. (e.g. Stop \r\n                      using chemical fertilizers. ) Make \r\n                      a Mini-Landfill. Fill a pair of women's pantyhose with the \r\n                      following items: a foam egg carton, empty tin can, empty \r\n                      glass bottle, piece of newspaper, an apple core, chewed \r\n                      stick of gum, a piece of natural fiber, a plant clipping, \r\n                      and a plastic straw. Bury the filled pantyhose at least \r\n                      8' deep, away from saturated soils. Mark the spot. After \r\n                      three months have passed, dig up the pantyhose from the \r\n                      ground and remove the contents carefully. Observe which \r\n                      materials have begun to biodegrade. \r\n                      Discuss with the children why this has happened. Candleholders \r\n                      From Plastic Soda Bottles - Have an adult cut the top off a 2-liter soda bottle (approximately \r\n                      six inches down). Trim the edges with a sharp pair of scissors. \r\n                      Make sure that the edge is even all around. Have the children \r\n                      decorate the holders by gluing various items to the holders \r\n                      (e.g. Use leftover scraps of paper or materials). Complete \r\n                      the project by adding a candle. Soda \r\n                      Bottle Terrarium - Have an adult remove the neck of a 2-liter \r\n                      plastic soda bottle (hint - use the bottoms of the bottles \r\n                      used in #5 above). Cut the bottle with a knife.   Remove \r\n                      the label and the black plastic bottom. Place the bottle \r\n                      in hot water to remove the bottom more easily. Fill the \r\n                      black bottom with potting soil and place plants, rocks and \r\n                      figures into the soil. Water thoroughly. Take the clear \r\n                      plastic body of the bottle, turn it up side down and slide \r\n                      it into the black bottom, making a dome for the terrarium."
