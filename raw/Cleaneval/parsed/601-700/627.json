      "text": "Wednesday 24 November 2004 Mr FINCH (Question) - Mr President, would \r\n    the Leader reveal what, if any, plans the Government has for the future of \r\n    Great South Land's oil and gas exploration lease, SEL 13/98, which covers \r\n    the eastern half of Tasmania? As the Leader will be aware the Australian Financial Review \r\n    reported on Friday that SEL 13/98 has just been renewed for a further five \r\n    years, effectively tying up half of Tasmania for oil and gas exploration to \r\n    an unlisted company whose chairman has stated that he is inspired by visions. As the conditions of the lease require a reported exploration \r\n    expenditure of $21 million, and Great South Land is reported to have capital \r\n    of less than $13 000, how soon can the State Government ensure more effective \r\n    exploration of lease SEL 13/98? Mr Harriss - That would be on Mr Rattray's property, wouldn't \r\n    it? Mrs Rattray-Wagner - Iwill pass that on. Mr AIRD - Ithought you were going to make a land tax comment. Mr President, Ithank the honourable member for his question. \r\n    The State Government is aware of Pierpont's article in last Friday's, that \r\n    is 19 November 2004, Australian Financial Review but has no comment to make \r\n    on the journalist's assessment on how a company is run. From the Government's position, Great South Land Minerals \r\n    Ltd - GSLM - was granted a special exploration licence for oil and gas exploration \r\n    over 30 356 square kilometres of mainland Tasmania for five years from 18 \r\n    May 1999. GSLM applied for an extension of this special exploration licence \r\n    over a reduced area on 6 May 2004. For the renewal the licence has been reduced \r\n    to 15 035 square kilometres, approximately 50 per cent of the original area \r\n    granted. Renewal of exploration licences can be made provided the applicant \r\n    demonstrates that they have the technical ability to carry out the proposed \r\n    work program and the funds to undertake the agreed work program. As part of \r\n    their renewal application, GSLM presented the Government with a letter from \r\n    GEM Global Yield Fund - GGYF - London, which stated that GGYF had entered \r\n    into an equity line of credit with GSLM to provide up to £150 million \r\n    to finance exploration for oil and gas in the Tasmanian basin. The renewal was granted on the basis that the licensee intends \r\n    to spend $21.5 million on exploration during the renewal period to define \r\n    or disprove commercial quantities of oil or gas. As a condition of renewal, \r\n    GSLM have agreed to meet additional licence conditions that will ensure that \r\n    the community gets a fair return from allocation of such a large area. These \r\n    conditions are as follows: · GLSM has provided a staged expenditure budget of \r\n    $21.5 million over five years. · The Government requires GLSM to meet 80 per cent of cumulative expenditure \r\n    commitment at the end of each year of the licence. Failure to meet this critical \r\n    condition will result in revocation of the licence. · Expenditure claimed under the licence must be consistent with industry \r\n    charges current at the time of the claim. · Expenses significantly higher than industry standards will not be \r\n    accepted. · Copies of all receipts shall be provided for consulting fees claimed \r\n    as expenditure. · MRT will be provided with copies of reports or advice from consultants \r\n    to substantiate such claims. GSLM shall provide a review of exploration activities to Mineral \r\n    Resources Tasmania - MRT - on 1 April and 1 October in each year and GSLM \r\n    shall provide a full interpretation report for the seismic work carried out \r\n    between January 2001 and June 2001. This report must be provided to MRT by \r\n    1 December 2004. The Minister for Infrastructure, Energy and Resources has \r\n    already publicly announced a renewal of the Great South Land licence in a \r\n    media release on Friday 29 October. The media release also included details \r\n    of various licence conditions, as previously mentioned."
