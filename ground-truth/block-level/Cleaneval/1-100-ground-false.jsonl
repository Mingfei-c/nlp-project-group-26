Iwould like to know how the \nArea Directors feel about the following ideas, many of which are \ninformed by the comments of Patrik, Ned, and others in the Apps \nDiscussion archives -- http://wilma.cs.utk.edu/mail-archive/discuss.1999-12 Proposed MMMS working group purpose:  The MMMS working group will \nproduce a series of Internet-Drafts, and attempt to produce RFCs, \ndescribing the use of end-to-end Internet multimedia messaging and \nrelated services on mobile devices.  The specifications will concern \napplication-level services as well as general end-to-end Internet \nservice specifications and lower-level services such as non-wireless \nserial PPP access from mobile devices.  No new protocols will be \ncreated; only existing open Internet standards and protocols free from\nany intellectual property encumbrance will be incorporated into MMMS \nspecifications, along with specific implementation interoperability \nguidelines.\n\nProposed special document status and process for MMMS specifications:  \nRecognizing that it may be impossible to achieve consensus on topics \nin which large and diverse corporate concerns have vested interests \nopposed to open standards, the MMMS working group will have a special \ngoal to produce Internet-Drafts which will identified as \"Frozen MMMS \nRFC-track Internet-Drafts.\"  These documents might never become RFCs \nbecause of an expected lack of consensus, but upon identification as \nsuch by the Working Group, they will be announced and archived as \nfrozen documents.  Developers may rely on such documents as static \nand vendors and customers will be encouraged to refer to them in their \nprocurement process.  The level of consensus required to designate \nFrozen MMMS RFC-track Internet-Drafts will be a simple majority of \nthose working group participants who are not affiliated with \norganizations having direct or indirect financial interests in \nclosed-protocol mobile services.  Any member of the working group not \naffiliated with organizations having direct or indirect financial \ninterests in closed-protocol mobile services may call a vote on the \ndesignation of any Internet-Draft as a Frozen MMMS RFC-track \nInternet-Draft, and if after one week's time there are more such MMMS \nWG participants in favor than dissenting, the WG Chair, the author of \nthe draft, or the participant calling the vote will then take steps to \nestablish a permanent archive of the draft and publish an announcement \nof its availability to the IETF community.  Anyone affiliated with \norganizations having direct or indirect financial interests in \nclosed-protocol mobile services may not call a vote or vote on such \nspecial designation, but all participants will have normal consensus \nrights in the traditional RFC process, and all Internet-Drafts must \nfollow the existing IESG intellectual property disclosure process.  \n\nProposed milestones:  The goals of the MMMS WG will include the \npublication of specifications, as described above, on the following \ntopics:  interoperable end-to-end Internet service access on mobile \ndevices, including descriptions of existing end-to-end wireless \nInternet service arrangements; implementation guidelines for multimedia \nmessaging services on mobile devices using existing Internet messaging \nstandards; guidelines concerning performance implications of link \nconstraints, including TCP behaviors during extended periods of \nwireless link downtime; and wired PPP access from mobile Internet \ndevices.\n\nJim Mathis:  Would you be interested in chairing a MMMS working group \ncharted as described above?  Would your organization's current apparent \ncommitment to closed-protocol mobile messaging solutions make you an \ninappropriate chair for such a group?  If you would not want to, or do \nnot feel you would be an appropriate chair, Iwould volunteer to serve \nas an interim chair.\n\nCheers,\nJames\n\n> At the November meeting, about 90 people attended the Mobile \n> Multimedia Messaging Service BOF:\n>\n> http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99nov/46th-99nov-ietf-42.html > \n> But the mailing list has been dead:\n>\n> http://www.imc.org/ietf-mmms/mail-archive/threads.html >\n> MMMS-related topics seem to be fairly prevalent on the general \n> IETF discussion list, with a lot of general agreement that the \n> status quo has some real problems.\n> \n> Has anyone started on a working group charter?\n> \n> There needs to be an organized effort to provide explicit and \n> well-documented alternatives to the closed-protocol, \n> pseudo-internet mobile access consortia, who are a real barrier \n> to easy and reasonable mobile multimedia messaging services.  \n> Ifor one would certainly contribute a great deal of time and \n> effort to the success of such a working group."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Received on Friday, 15 September 2000 17:53:45 GMT This message : [ Message body ] Next message : Patrik Fältström : \"Re: Mobile Multimedia Messaging Service\" Previous message : comunicado@elcultural.com: \"Noticias de actualidad\" Next in thread : Patrik Fältström : \"Re: Mobile Multimedia Messaging Service\" Reply : Patrik Fältström : \"Re: Mobile Multimedia Messaging Service\" Reply : Leslie Daigle: \"Re: Mobile Multimedia Messaging Service\" Maybe reply : James P.

In this section, as in the previous one,\r\n    we have chosen to address some of the more common \"post-treatment\" issues which\r\n    many breast cancer survivors may be concerned with. Along with the resources we list at\r\n    the end of this section, you should talk with your doctor about any health situation that\r\n    gives you concern. HORMONE\r\n    REPLACEMENT THERAPY Ihave breast cancer and had been taking\r\n    hormone replacement therapy.  Should Icontinue to take it? Your doctor should advise you about whether\r\n    to continue HRT (hormone replacement therapy) at the time you are diagnosed with breast\r\n    cancer. Generally, hormone replacement therapy is not recommended for women who have been\r\n    diagnosed with breast cancer. Why would hormone therapy be given to\r\n    women with breast cancer? Researchers have found a way to use\r\n    hormones as therapy against breast cancer. This is different than HRT (hormone replacement\r\n    therapy), which is given to imcrease levels of hormones (such as estrogen and\r\n    progesterone) that are decreased in the body due to menopause. One hormone therapy drug for breast\r\n    cancer is Tamoxifen.  By blocking estrogen, Tamoxifen can block the growth of cancer\r\n    cells. If your tumor is estrogen receptor positive (called \"ER positive\") this\r\n    may be a good treatment for your breast cancer.  (Estrogen receptors are found in the\r\n    nucleus or center of the tumor cell. The ER allows cells to use estrogen to grow).  \r\n    Tamoxifen can be used alone, with chemotherapy, or following chemotherapy. Tamoxifen is\r\n    also being used to prevent breast cancers from developing. You may want to ask your doctor\r\n    about this. LYMPHEDEMA"}]}

We can begin with one of the 'founding fathers' of the idea - perhaps the founding father - Karl Erik Sveiby, who wrote  the first book on the subject in 1990 under the Swedish title, ' Kunskapledning ' ( Sveiby, 1990 ). Sveiby is now a consultant, based in Australia but working globally, and his Web site contains a great deal of information on the subject, although his main concern is now with the measurement of 'intangible assets' and other aspects of 'intellectual capital'. Apaper originally written in 1996 notes that 'knowledge management' consists of two 'tracks': the 'IT- track', which is information management, and the 'people track', which is the management of people ( Sveiby, 2001a ). Elsewhere on the site, in the Frequently Asked Questions file, Sveiby answers the question, 'Why should knowledge be managed?', to which the response is:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Idon't believe knowledge can be managed. Knowledge Management is a poor term, but we are stuck with it, Isuppose. \"Knowledge Focus\" or \"Knowledge Creation\" (Nonaka) are better terms, because they describe a mindset, which sees knowledge as activity not an object.

However, some papers are still available. In particular, there is an issue of the house journal Investment Management Perspectives which contains eight papers on various aspects of 'knowledge management'. The first ( Yu, 2000 ), has a section headed, 'What is knowledge management?', which then fails to define it - there is a good deal on what 'knowledge' is and about what it is important to include in a 'knowledge management' programme, but no definition. There is also the usual confusion between 'tacit knowledge' and what we might call 'expressible but previously unexpressed' or implicit knowledge. The other papers deal with the problem of measuring the success of a knowledge management programme, but there is no definition of knowledge that distinguishes it from information, and the cases explored appear to be cases of information management rather than 'knowledge management' ( Petrash, 2000 ). Similar problems plague the remaining papers - they deal with interesting topics, such as information sharing and the role of information technology, but they lack any coherent theoretical basis upon which to base any conception of 'knowledge management'.

However, since 1993, Bain and Company have been tracking the use of various management tools and according to their latest survey covering the year 2000 ( Bain & Company, 2001 ) only about 35% of their world-wide sample of 451 companies was using 'knowledge management', reporting a satisfaction rating of about 3.5 on a five-point scale. The usage figure puts 'knowledge management' in 19th position, out of 25 management tools. This compares with about 70% using benchmarking, and almost 80% using strategic planning.

The question rattled the group. Answers sputtered forth. This was obviously a sore subject. It seems to me that there are three possible answers to the question \"Is this search-and-replace marketing?\" given that this question expresses customer pain and suspicion: No, we've added important new features designed to help you with your KM chores. Sort of. We have the same features as always but have discovered new applications for them. Yes, you pathetic loser. The first two answers are perfectly acceptable. The third is perhaps a tad too honest to make it in this imperfect world, although undoubtedly there is some \"kewl\" company that is contemplating using this as the center of its advertising campaign.

Eventually, Ifound that everything that had previously been located under 'information management' was now identified as 'knowledge management' and brint.com was claiming to be the Web's best site for information on the subject. As noted above, the confusion of 'knowledge' as a synonym for 'information' is one of the most common effects of the 'knowledge management' fad.

The following piece is taken from that paper:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "The reach of the new technology for information sharing:  Many factors have transformed the way in which organizations now view information, but perhaps the pivotal development has been the dramatically extended reach of know-how through new information technology. Rapidly falling costs of communications and computing and the extraordinary growth and accessibility of the World Wide Web present new opportunities for information-based organizations, to share knowledge more widely and cheaply than ever before. Thus organizations with operations and employees around the world are now able to mobilize their expertise from whatever origin to apply rapidly to new situations. As a result, clients are coming to expect from global organizations, not merely the know-how of the particular team that has been assigned to the task, but the very best that the organization as a whole has to offer. Information sharing is thus enabling - and forcing - institutions that are international in the scope of their operations, to become truly global in character by enabling information transfer to occur across large distances within a very short time.

However, what is 'tacit knowledge'? The term originates with Polanyi (1958), chemist turned philosopher of science, and has been described as:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "'the idea that certain cognitive processes and/or behaviors are undergirded by operations inaccessible to consciousness' ( Barbiero, n.d. )"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This is the key point about Polanyi's concept: 'tacit' means 'hidden', tacit knowledge is hidden knowledge, hidden even from the consciousness of the knower. This is why Polanyi used the phrase 'We know more than we can tell.' Aphrase parroted even by those who mis-use the idea and believe that this hidden knowledge, inaccessible to the consciousness of the knower, can somehow be 'captured'. Polanyi equates tacit knowledge with 'acts of comprehension':"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "'tacit knowing achieves comprehension by indwelling, and... all knowledge consists of or is rooted in such acts of comprehension' ( Polanyi, 1958 )"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In other words, 'tacit knowledge' involves the process of comprehension, a process which is, itself, little understood. Consequently,  tacit knowledge is an inexpressible process that enables an assessment of phenomena in the course of becoming knowledgeable about the world. In what sense, then, can it be captured? The answer, of course, is that it cannot be 'captured' - it can only be demonstrated through our expressible knowledge and through our acts. How did the idea that tacit knowledge could be 'captured' arise? The guilty party appears to be Nonaka , (1991) and Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), who appear to have either  misunderstood Polanyi's work, or deliberately distorted it to enable them to construct the well-known two-by-two diagram. Having cited Polanyi as the source of the idea of 'tacit knowledge' and having noted that Polanyi refers to the process of 'indwelling', whereby people create knowledge of the world around them, Nonaka and Takeuchi go on to state that:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "While Polanyi argues the contents for tacit knowledge further in a philosophic context, it is also possible to expand his idea [my emphasis] in a more practical direction. ( Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995 : 60)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They then note that:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Mental models, such as schemata, paradigms, perspectives, beliefs and viewpoints help individuals to perceive and define their world.  ( Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995 : 60)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "and include such models within tacit knowledge. However, if such models can be expressed by the person they constitute not tacit knowledge, which, as noted earlier, is inexpressible, but expressible knowledge, which, when expressed, becomes information.  Such previously unexpressed but expressible knowledge may be termed 'implicit' knowledge. In fact, the example cited by Nonaka & Takeuchi (1995:63-64) makes it clear that implicit knowledge is being talked about here. The case of bread-making is discussed and the fact that the head baker of the Osaka International Hotel twisted the dough as well as stretching it, is given as an example of 'tacit' knowledge - but no-one appears to have asked the baker how he made the bread! Ihave no doubt that (as a bread-maker myself) that he would have been able to describe his bread-making process in detail, including the process of twisting. The approach appears to be, \"If Isee something Ihadn't noticed before, or knew of before, then those actions, or whatever, must constitute tacit knowledge.\" As a research approach this is somewhat lacking, nor is it very helpful as a guide to discovering practice. One must also bear in mind the cultural context of this example: Iasked a Japanese colleague whether someone acting the role of apprentice in Japan would think of questioning the 'master' and, of course, she shook her head and smiled. The 'apprentices' in the example would never have thought of asking. Nonaka and Takeuchi put forward the proposition, embodied in the diagram, that 'tacit knowledge' is somehow derived from explicit knowledge and, by other means, is made explicit. However, it is clear, from the analysis above, that implicit knowledge, which is not normally expressed, but may be expressed, is actually intended here. Implicit knowledge is that which we take for granted in our actions, and which may be shared by others through common experience or culture. For example, in establishing a production facility in a foreign country, a company knows it needs to acquire local knowledge of 'how things are done here'. Such knowledge may not be written down, but is known by people living and working in the culture and is capable of being written down, or otherwise conveyed to those who need to know. The knowledge is implicit in the way people behave towards one another, and towards authority, in that foreign culture, and the appropriate norms of behaviour can be taught to the newcomers. Implicit knowledge, in other words, is expressible: tacit knowledge is not, and Nonaka would have saved a great deal of confusion had he chosen the more appropriate term. The critical reader might ask him/herself: 'Does it make any difference to the argument if, in the diagram, we replace \"tacit knowledge\" with \"knowledge\" and \"explicit knowledge\" with \"information\"?'"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The people perspective"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The literature of 'knowledge management' claims that the 'people' dimension is more important than the technological (in spite of the fact that most of the same literature is heavily oriented towards technology use). As noted earlier, Sveiby (2001a) holds that the 'management of people' is one of the two tracks of 'knowledge management', and the work of the World Bank is held up by a number of writers as evidence for the power of the 'people management' track of 'knowledge management'. However, when we examine the World Bank's 'knowledge management' strategy, the reality (as with the technology track) bears little relation to the rhetoric. The 'vision' of the World Bank is that it should become not simply a financial agency but the world's 'Knowledge Bank'. With the retirement of Stephen Denning as head of the Bank's 'knowledge management' initiative, and his re-emergence as a 'knowledge management' consultant (see, http://www.stevedenning.com/ ), the Bank has re-thought its strategy and removed the earlier documents. The rhetoric is no longer about 'knowledge management', but about 'knowledge sharing'. The new initiative as described by the Bank's Managing Director, Mamphela Ramphele (2002) still has four elements, but these are now expressed as follows:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "The first, is fostering policy, regulatory, and network readiness, by supporting the development of an adequate enabling environment for efficiency, competition, and innovation in knowledge sharing, and development of information and communication technologies. The second element focuses on building human capacity for the knowledge economy, by promoting excellence in education, from the basic to the tertiary level, as well as the new skills needed for information and communication technologies. Associated activities include work towards getting schools, classrooms, and libraries online, and promoting development of innovative approaches that extend the reach of education and training, such as distance learning, community-based training, and networking of educational institutions. The third element of the strategy focuses on continued efforts to expand basic connectivity and access, and invest in information technology applications. Key activities include mobilizing resources to improve information infrastructure, working on ways to reduce the cost of connectivity, supporting community access programs, and developing local content and entrepreneurial information technology opportunities. The final key element of the strategy is focused on promoting the generation and sharing of global knowledge, through support for knowledge networking, global research, and communities of practice. This will focus on creating and applying the knowledge necessary to stimulate and facilitate the transition to the knowledge economy-as well as the knowledge necessary to reap its full economic, social, and cultural benefits."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In fact, these are almost identical to the original four, the second and third have the same titles. The focus continues to be heavily technology-oriented and one might be forgiven for imagining that the real aim of the World Bank is to help U.S.-based global industries to sell more hardware and software to the developing world. Given that the Bank is located in Washington, D.C., where one of the biggest industries is the lobby industry, this would not be surprising. Another 'knowledge management' legend, promulgated by Davenport (1997) is that Microsoft has a 'knowledge management' strategy. What does this turn out to be?"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "The knowledge base for Microsoft IT must always be current. Therefore, the IT group has focused heavily on the issue of identifying and maintaining knowledge competencies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In other words, this 'knowledge management strategy' is a training programme. Of course, it is wrapped up in the jargon of the day:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "'The project, called Skills Planning \"und\" Development (thus affectionately known as \"SPUD\") is focused not on entry level competencies, but rather on those needed and acquired to stay on the leading edge of the workplace.'"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "and"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "'Development of a structure of competency types and levels; Defining the competencies required for particular jobs; Rating the performance of individual employees in particular jobs based on the competencies; Implementing the knowledge competencies in an online system; Linkage of the competency model to learning offerings.'"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "However, a training programme remains a training programme and the fact that a high-technology company like Microsoft needs knowledgeable people and needs to maintain their knowledge bases hardly seems remarkable. There is more to the 'people perspective' than the efforts of the World Bank, of course. The principal aim of this arm of 'knowledge management' is to improve the sharing of information in organizations and one of the chief ways in which this is attempted is by encouraging personal networking and the development of 'communities of practice'. Lesser and Storck (2001), in a paper referred to earlier, in the analysis of journal papers, and citing a paper by Storck and Hill (2000), draw attention to the difference between teams and communities of practice:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Team relationships are established when the organization assigns people to be team members. Community relationships are formed around practice. Similarly, authority relationships within the team are organizationally determined. Authority relationships in a community of practice emerge through interaction around expertise. Teams have goals, which are often established by people not on the team. Communities are only responsible to their members. Teams rely on work and reporting processes that are organizationally defined. Communities develop their own processes."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Of course these distinctions would be meaningful if organizations were structured in such a way as to encourage the creation of 'communities' in which members owed allegiance only to one another and had the autonomy to develop their own ways of working. Expertise might well then be shared. However, organizations are not like this and business organizations in particular are certainly not always like this. Business organizations (especially public companies) are generally driven by the idea of 'shareholder value', which emphasises short-term strategies that are likely to increase the share value. Chief of these strategies are those that seek cost savings, leading often to a rather blinkered choice of the reduction of staff to achieve savings. Coupled with the kind of corporate misgovernance that we have seen in the cases of Enron, WorldCom, and others, one must doubt that business organizations are busy building the kind of corporate cultures that will actually encourage 'communities of practice'"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Conclusion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The inescapable conclusion of this analysis of the 'knowledge management' idea is that it is, in large part, a management fad, promulgated mainly by certain consultancy companies, and the probability is that it will fade away like previous fads. It rests on two foundations: the management of information - where a large part of the fad exists (and where the 'search and replace marketing' phenomenon is found), and the effective management of work practices. However, these latter practices are predicated upon a Utopian idea of organizational culture in which the benefits of information exchange are shared by all, where individuals are given autonomy in the development of their expertise, and where 'communities' within the organization can determine how that expertise will be used. Sadly, we are a long way removed from that Utopia: whatever businesses claim about people being their most important resource, they are never reluctant to rid themselves of that resource (and the knowledge it possesses) when market conditions decline. In the U.K. we can point to British Airways, which, in the aftermath of the terrorist attack of the 11th September 2001, paid off more than 7,000 of its 'knowledge resources' - financial observers suggested that they were simply waiting for a suitable excuse to do so, management having taken disastrous business decisions which had reduced profitability. We can also point to Barclays Bank, with profits of more than 2 billion in 2001 and profit growth that year of almost 3.0%, which, nevertheless, paid off some 10% of its total global workforce. No imagination appears to have been used by either of these companies to determine ways in which their 'most important resource' might be more effectively employed to increase turnover and profits. The two companies mentioned are not atypical and we have to ask, 'If getting promotion, or holding your job, or finding a new one is based on the knowledge you possess - what incentive is there to reveal that knowledge and share it?' This is not to say that enabling people to contribute effectively to the management of organizations is impossible and that sharing knowledge and enabling people to use their creativity in innovative ways in organizations is impossible - simply that it is very difficult, and that it does not reduce to some simplistic concept of 'knowledge management'! It demands a change in business culture, from the macho Harvard Business School model, to something more thoughtful and understanding of what motivates human beings. Organizations need to learn to think about problems, rather than grab at proffered 'solutions' - which often turn out to be expensive side-tracks away from the main issues. For example, if you have a poorly-rewarded and, hence, poor sales force, no amount of data warehousing (another so-called 'knowledge management' tool) is going to give you good customer relations. Areasonable question to ask, at this stage, is, 'Why now?'. Why has 'knowledge management' achieved such a fashionable status is the business world? This question was asked on the KNOW-ORG mailing list and my response was as follows:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "First, and largely because of a fixation on internal organizational data, the term 'information' has become almost synonymous with data in the minds of organizational heads. For example, I've been told that the National Electronic Library for Health uses the term 'Knowledge' because in the NHS information=data and a different term was needed. We have to lay this, Ithink, at the feet of the information systems profession whose focus for years was data and data definitions, etc. In fact, they dealt not with information systems but with data systems. Secondly, and opportunely for the software houses and IT firms, 'km' came along just as they were being hit by the wave of scepticism over the possibility of IT ever delivering more than problems - and certainly never likely to deliver productivity and performance. 'Whoops, we've cracked it!' cried the IBMs and MSofts of this world - 'We should have been dealing with 'knowledge' all along, and now we are - Lotus Notes is no longer groupware and personal information management, it's KnowledgeWare!' So they are happily marketing the same product under a new name. Thirdly, the organization and management boys finally began to realise that all this text that people were creating on word-processors, etc., needed to be managed effectively and, indeed, organized, shared and disseminated more effectively, but they couldn't use 'information management' because that was 'information systems' and data, wasn't it? So it must be 'knowledge', right?  If we can only get people to share their 'knowledge' performance must improve because it is the communication barriers that are preventing the free flow of 'knowledge' (i.e., information). So, now, every aspect of organization and management theory has to have a 'knowledge' dimension, otherwise you aren't in the game.  In the literature, of course, this amounts to the token use of the term 'knowledge management' and the use of 'knowledge' as a synonym for 'information'. Fourthly, at the forefront of all this were the management consultancies - why? Because BPR and Organizational Learning were running out of steam.  Amusingly, all organizational learning work appears to come under the heading of 'km' - more search and replace marketing. So, the consultancies grabbed at km in order to have something to sell at the end of the 90s. Finally, most (or at least many) departments of information management or information science, and departments of information systems in academia, are somewhat low on the totem pole in most of their institutions, and each needs to differentiate itself from the other in order to try to work its way up that greasy pole, so both have seized on km as an aid in the struggle. Iforesee turf-wars over which department, where there is one of each, has the right to run degrees in km. Where only one of the kind exists, it will seek to make km all-embracing of management, computer science, information systems, etc., etc. - because the logic leads nowhere else :-)  'If WE deal with knowledge - then how can anyone else presume to do so?' ( Wilson, 2001 )"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Isee no reason to change my opinions as a result of the analysis carried out for this paper, but Iwould add that, according to the rhetoric of 'knowledge management', 'mind' becomes 'manageable', the content of mind can be captured or down-loaded and the accountant's dream of people-free production, distribution and sales is realized - 'knowledge' is now in the database, recoverable at any time. That may be Utopia for some, but not for many. Fortunately, like most Utopias, it cannot be realized. This analysis of 'knowledge management' may not have much significance to the world of business practice, where the academic literature is rarely read unless filtered through the 'airport book'. One might argue that for information practitioners to call themselves (or for the organization to call them) 'Knowledge Managers' does no harm and may do some good, in terms of giving a higher profile to their role (even if a number of them are rather embarrassed by the title). However, the aim of the university and of those who work for it is to expose ideas to critical analysis and to inculcate in students the same abilities. It is, perhaps, a sad reflection on the way in which the university, world-wide, has changed from the 'temple' to the 'factory' ( Beckman, 1989 ) that so many academics are prepared to jump on the bandwagon - one's only satisfaction is that the bandwagon lacks wheels."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Note : the data for 2002 were obtained on 21st February 2003 and some December journals may be published later.
