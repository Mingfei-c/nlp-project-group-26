There are just a few ground rules Ithink we need to establish before you go for your interview. Standard things, really, nothing to worry about. Firstly, remember to wear a suit and tie. And shoes. And underwear. Socks are good too, as is a shirt. Basically, go fully dressed. The embassy are less likely to approve your request if you arrive in states of semi-dress, partial dress or, indeed, full undress. Especially as they will have nowhere to clip your security pass that you would want a security pass to be clipped to. Those safety pins can sting, you know. We've asked around your office, for background information about you, and we were wondering if you could be a little bit less … well, you. We're not saying that you should lie in your interview, at least not factually, but you should perhaps be aware that when you answer questions, you should resist any urges you might have to overelaborate. Agood start is to give your name properly when asked to do so at the beginning of the interview. We have a list of answers to this seemingly simple question which the embassy do not regard as legitimate responses:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Who the man? Me the man. Whoever you want me to be, baby. Who am I? Who the hell are you? King Zog of Albania Iam woman, hear me roar."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Please resist the temptation to give these or any other of the prohibited answers. We'll give you the list when you leave. Now this next point applies to all of the questions you will be asked. Answer directly, simply and honestly, without attempting to bring your personality, such as it is, into the matter. For example, how would you answer the question, \"Have you ever been involved in terrorism?\" (muffled response) You see, that's precisely the sort of thing we need to cut out. Embassy officials do not have any sense of humour, at least not one officially recognised by the State Department or by Her Majesty's Foreign and Commonwealth Office. They will not appreciate a water-shooting flower in your lapel, they will look unkindly upon a concealed electric buzzer in your palm when you shake their hand and they especially dislike stink bombs. Or any other bombs. In fact, all other bombs. You may be under the impression that your sarcasm will be interpreted as wit, perhaps charm, perhaps even the self-deprecating and worldly-wise bon mots of a subtle, dry satirist. This impression is wrong. Whatever amusement you intend will be heard only as \"Iam annoying, please reject my application\". At best, they will attribute your verbal incontinence as evidence of nervousness, at worst it will be decided that you are trying to hide something, be it state secrets, a murky and troubled past, or possibly explosives concealed around your person. Afurther note about your answers. Please remember that at no point during the interview should you question the patriotism of the embassy officials. They do not appreciate being called Communists. They dislike this quite intensely. (muffled enquiry) No, you are expressly forbidden from stating, as you put it, 'You, sir, are not a patriot'. (muffled response) Expressly forbidden. As to other matters, you should remember that your bag will be searched as you enter the building and you may be asked to show the contents of your bag at any time during your wait there. It would be advisable for you to clear out any, shall we say, materials of an unusual or sensitive nature before you attend. We have a prohibited list for you to take away and read; sorry for the cigarette burn in the corner, that was made by one of our less successful candidates. Body language in your interview is very important, as the consular officers will be watching you for any sign of misplaced stress, nerves, or even major psychological disorders. Flapping your arms around your face to rid yourself from the invisible flies in front of you will not create a good impression. Speaking in tongues is likewise ill-advised, as is any attempt to convert your interviewer to any new religion where you are the godhead. One last point to recall is that Marines will be stationed at the embassy and they have orders to shoot first, shoot second, consider some more shooting and then fax Washington, DC for permission to hire someone who will ask a question at a future time to be decided, all while shooting. They should be addressed as 'sir' at all times."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the absurdity of filling out long, long forms Question 38.

Almost mockingly, the lift remains on the floor for a few more seconds, allowing Jason to look, to stare unashamedly through the metal-framed glass door through at Poppy before the lift bears her down towards the ground. Her eyes are looking up as the lift descends and he wonders what's going through her mind. Jason starts to walk back along the corridor until a thought, a voice, an insistence stops him. Slowed down, Jason's thought process could bear scrutiny, as instincts of which he is scarcely aware stir and combine to move him into action. He runs across the walkway towards the main doors, fumbling for his security pass to get back into his office. Halfway across, he skids to a stop and leans over the balcony to look down for other lifts. All are on the ground floor, none moving, none rising to meet him and bring hope. He turns back and runs towards the main doors. Security pass in hand, he swipes it past the electronic slate which beeps a denial. Gritting his teeth to prevent himself from swearing overloudly, Jason swipes the card again. This time the small light flickers from amber to green and he can hear the small thunk of magnets releasing. He grabs hold of the door, swings it open and heads towards a corner staircase. The staircases in the building, four of them, all need to be accessed with a swipe card and Jason is rejected by the building's electronic caretakers once more. Again presses the card to the pad, again he is accepted the second time. The advertised opulence of the company reception is thrown into desperate relief by the spartan stairwell which Jason runs down, one hand on the speckled and cut handrail, the other hand flailing for balance as he navigates each predictable yet sudden corner. There are no signs to tell him which floor he has reached, or which half-floor, no way of assessing his progress as he bounds down the stairs, taking them two at a time, leaping the final three to the halfway landing and grabbing the wall partition for support, as a fulcrum, to twist himself round the next point, gaining momentum, striding longer, moving faster, urgent. Until he falls. Poppy leaves the lift at the ground floor and walks towards the reception desk, remembering that she has to hand in her visitor pass. Atwo-hour meeting passed without event as usual, as her two hour meetings on Wednesdays in this building usually do. She considers whether to have a coffee despite the fact that she isn't sure whether she wants one. She looks around, as though someone is watching her, as though there are questions about her presence, her eligibility to be in this place at this time. She goes over to the cafe and orders, remembering that the servers are slow. There is a lingering impulse in her mind to remain. Placed on the counter, the mere presence of coffee wakes her up. Poppy murmurs thanks to the girl behind the counter then moves over to a free table. To complete the pretence of belonging, she withdraws her notebook and begins to read the notes from the last meeting, countering the overriding compulsion to look back at the lifts. She flips the pages of her notebook back to the beginning, justifying this as an overview of the entire project, realising that it is an excuse to stay for longer, wondering whether she has invented something in her own mind that doesn't exist, outwardly calm and efficient. Afew minutes pass and she realises that she has been moving the pages, turn by turn, without reading any of them. Her gaze has been steady, at a midpoint between her notes and the edge of the table; waiting, hoping, anticipating. Aglance at her watch confirms what Poppy already knows, that this is time borrowed and that she has to leave. She doesn't bother to drink any more from the coffee she has only sipped as she picks up the notebook and packs it into her briefcase, making slow motions. She hands in her security pass at reception and walks beyond the security gates. Leaving the building, turning to walk to the station, she allows herself a brief backwards glance. While he hopes that the bruise will reduce and fade in time, Jason knows that he has no time to think about this. First impressions are past regrets and there is no place for them as he hopes that he has replaced everything from his pockets and bounds down the final steps to the ground floor. He barges into the doors with his shoulder, forgetting the necessity for his security pass, and is rewarded by falling back on the floor. For the first time today, his pass is accepted without query and he throws open the door into the broad, open space of the building's ground floor. He looks towards the entry/exit gates. He looks towards the lifts. He runs over to the reception area and looks out onto the street. Jason runs out onto the street, already defeated when he leaves the final doors. He stops, pauses, gives up. Head hanging, he starts to turn when a hand restrains him. Looking up, he sees Poppy, concerned and vulnerable: porcelain. Looking up at her, he doesn't know what to say; looking at her as he stands up properly and ready, he doesn't know what he was doing other than the fact that it was right. Poppy stands there, wondering why she had the instinct to return, wondering how she had the nerve to reach over and touch him. She doesn't know what he's going to say and she's terrified, mortified, waiting for the inevitable rejection, the horror that could ensue after building up something so much in her head. He looks around, as if further inspiration is needed, and stays silent. Her hand still rests on his forearm. He doesn't know what to say and neither does she. He takes the initiative and holds her hand. He clasps it for a moment before telling her that he'll see her at the next meeting, or words to that purpose. He relinquishes her hand and goes back through the glass doors into the building. Staring, unbelieving, Poppy remains. For a moment, for a heartbeat, she remains where she is, considering the past few minutes, considering the spectrum of emotions she has coloured, considering everything she might have felt or possibly still does. As he reaches the security gates, the receptionist beckons him over. informing him that he needs to wait for a moment. He asks if there is a problem with his pass. She says no. He asks whether there is a problem with the gates, perhaps they are defective and aren't allowing people access to the building. She says no. He is about to ask another question when the girl behind the desk points behind him, through the glass, through those transparent doors and into the street. Poppy stands there, perhaps on the verge of tears, perhaps considering coming back into the building. The girl at reception leans in towards Jason and details his attempts to get from the fourth floor to the ground. She provides the narrative of Poppy's timewasting on the ground floor. She advises him that she won't readmit him to the building until she sees that the girl outside is ready to leave, one way or another. Jason starts to walk out when he sees Poppy walking in back in. They meet between glass doors. Standing apart, they stare and hear the magnetic locks between the doors slowly close. Poppy admits that she waited for him. Jason admits that he ran down the stairwells to reach her. Poppy admits, Jason admits. They talk for a few minutes or so before the receptionist unlocks the doors."}]}

Comment: From: M.X.N.T.4.1 Jun 03, 05 - 09:09 am \"Macintosh owners buy 30% more software than their Windows counterparts\" Ithink the important information is that mac users pay for more software. The average windows user will get office, or at least word with their pc and really what else do they buy? Anti-virus software, maybe some games? Since Ibought my mac Ihave paid for more software than Iever imagined Iwould, a lot of it is shareware type stuff and admittedly Icould get freeware versions but Iappreciate the good work and am willing to shell out a few bucks for it. On windows if you do a search for a particular kind of app you get thousands of matches - most of which are truly awful. As a result most windows people don't pay for anything. The average windows pc will be full of dozens of freeware apps that people never use. My mac has dozens and dozens of apps Iuse all the time, some free, some not. It's all well and good having a much bigger market of users but with apple you get a quality (and growing) market of paying users. Wizzard Software have cleverly realised this.

Comment: From: jdb Jun 03, 05 - 02:20 pm Idon't think sales represents the percentage of Mac users. The real percentage is a little lower, probably around 10%.

Comment: From: Ampar Jun 03, 05 - 02:39 pm \" In addition, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) estimates that 16 percent of computer users are on Macs.\" Actually, what they really meant was, \" In addition, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) estimates that the TOP 16 percent of computer users are on Macs.\" Comment: From: What's the frequency, Kenneth? Jun 03, 05 - 04:24 pm Actually, it's hard to tell where SPA gets their numbers, but they _did_ differentiate between market population and market veracity.  That is, they believe Mac users buy 18% of the software and comprise 16% of the installed base.  It _would_ be interesting to know where they get their numbers. Maybe since Internet Exploder has been hit so badly in the browser wars, we're seeing some \"real\" numbers for who's (online, at least) using what operating systems. Comment: From: Virtual-Twin Jun 04, 05 - 01:11 am It confirm what Iwas thinking. Mac users are more inclined to pay for software, just as they are more inclined to pay for online digital music... Why do you think Apple is dominating the online music store market? Aside from having the best product? Because Mac users and PC users that like Apple are valuing intellectual property more than the average folks. These people know that Apple was more than once \"copied\" by companies like Microsoft. People that don't want to give Apple any credit are often people that don't value intellectual property in general. \"Everyone is copying (each other) anyway\" is their moto... Another reason why Mac users put more value in IP is that many of them are content creator themselves. Comment: From: advocate_one Jun 05, 05 - 04:12 am so what about Linux then??? we don't have very many viruses either... I'm sure that a very high proportion of that 16% figure is really Linux users. Comment: From: Virtual-Twin Jun 05, 05 - 04:46 am advocate_one, even if half of those were Linux users, lets say 8%, that would leave 8% for Macs and that would still be much higher than the 2% numbers that some people like to repeat (Yes it's the percentage of computer sold, not the installed based and the number actually rose to 3.6%) But Iwonder how they could make such a stupid error in their research. In reality, Idoubt that 8% of computer users run Linux as their only OS. Many dual boot, and still use Windows a good part of the time. Developers wont port applications to another OS if the people using it are just a reboot away from Windows. (Hence when they do port to another OS they chose the Mac OS because its users -can't- use Windows) The real installed base of Mac users in percentage of home computer users are probably something like 8-10% Comment: From: toti Jun 05, 05 - 04:51 am Virtual-Twin wrote \"Because Mac users and PC users that like Apple are valuing intellectual property more than the average folks.\" Actually most Mac users don't give a diddly about IP. What Mac users do care about is a job well done. If the IP is original or \"borrowed\" they care about, do not. Ihave over US$5000 ( that's three zeroes ) of software, published and shareware, that Ihave paid for in the past three and a half year ( since Iswitched to Mac ), and mostly I'm pleased about every penny Ihave shelled out. Agood product and good service is what people care about. The \"IP\" is something most people don't evenn understand ( and at least for now, a US only thing - software isn't patentable in EU/EFTA, not yet and hopefully never ) Comment: From: Pandora Jun 05, 05 - 05:23 am Basically this \"research\" is worthless. Even taking them at face value and assuming that 16% of users are not suffering from virus and malware attacks, what makes them think that equates to Mac usage? Linux users, many of whom no longer dual-boot (dual-booting is SO 20th century, darling!) are at least as secure from these programs as Mac users. But even Windows users can be too. Ihave unpatched Windows 98 machines running behind a one-line Linux firewall with no problems because the users are smart enough to never open strange email attachments, never follow dubious links and never ever use IE to browse the Web. That's pretty well all it takes. That 16% is not going to be all Mac users. probably not even half once Linux; BSD; sensible old Windows users; and modern, firewall-included, Firefox-using Windows users are subtracted out. Comment: From: Me Jun 05, 05 - 06:21 am \"Even taking them at face value and assuming that 16% of users are not suffering from virus and malware attacks, what makes them think that equates to Mac usage?\" Idiot. The article says: 'In addition, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) estimates that 16 percent of computer users are on Macs.' And: 'Macintosh enthusiasts have enjoyed - literally - zero viruses' This is NOT equivilant to \"16% of computer users do not suffer viruses and all of them are Mac users\" Read the damn thing before posting. Comment: From: Pandora Jun 05, 05 - 06:34 am \"16-percent of computer users are unaffected by viruses, malware because they use Apple Macs\" Maybe you should try reading at least the headline before telling people to read the article. Iagree, though, that the article conflates several different sources and then throws in the above title for no justifiable reason. On the other hand, 16% Mac usage is simply not believable. My experience is that Mac and Linux are about tied so that would make Windows' market share just under 70%, and that's just not right. Regardless of Linux, web log stats consistantly show Mac useage in the low single figures. Are Mac users in some way averse to using the Web? Idon't think so. As Isaid, this \"research\" is worthless. Comment: From: Raymond Jun 05, 05 - 06:47 am Don't forget the huge number of Macs around that never show up on any internet usage statistics becuase they are not connected to the net. Ithink of production systems in newspapers, video-editing, music-editing/creating. Systems that are on separate networks, physically disconnected from the Internet. This is areas where macs always have been popular. Comment: From: simdude Jun 05, 05 - 07:06 am Idon't think you'll see Apple hype this very much because this is the type of thing that could backfire. As Mac gain a larger market share, they become a more desirable target and virus will eventually be written. Ithink OS Xdoes a much better job than other OS's in closing security holes (along with other BSD systems), but these are the types of stories I'm sure Apple loves to see others promote while they sit back quietly and smile. Comment: From: Jun 05, 05 - 07:12 am I'm a little confused here.  This 16% figure seems to be based on sales of software, right?  If this is the case (and it seems to be) then isn't this about as spurious as countering 'computer sales' to estimate the percentage of users. And where does this leave me.  I'm a Linux user.  In the past five years I've used Linux on desktops and servers, I've never violated the usage rights on software and (here's the kicker) I've never paid for software.  Nadda, not a cent. So how many Linux users are there out there that are completely ignored by counting software sales?  Given there wasn't a single mention of computer users that use open source software, it's hard to take these statistics that seriosly? It looks more like some statician's attempt at trying to mount an argument that more manufacturers should focus on Mac users that any credible assessment of who uses what. Comment: From: Smitry Jun 05, 05 - 08:35 am While Mac OS X 10.3.9 IS stable and can run months without reboots, the Apple's Tiger, the new boy in town, keeps crashing all the time and, apparently, is the most unstable and full of bugs version of Mac OS Xever :( Comment: From: ThePromenader Jun 05, 05 - 08:41 am \"a big fsck you to Microsoft\" ...make that a big \"fsck -f\" : ) Comment: From: Ditto Jun 05, 05 - 08:47 am Since upgrading to tiger on 4 different machines, so many apps crash regularly.. suprisingly the apps that crash the most are apple apps (mail, safari) and the dashboard frequently takes 15-20% cpu bogging down the system. Comment: From: Mac Admin Jun 05, 05 - 09:03 am Ihave Mac OS X 10.4.1 Tiger running on an installation of over 800 Macs comprising over 8 different Mac models.  It is rock solid for me.  Sounds like a few users above have corrupted prefs and/or are trying to run apps that's aren't updated for Tiger.  Unless you know what the hell you're talking about, you should not be blaming Tiger. Comment: From: Volte Jun 05, 05 - 09:27 am *Sigh* You guys don't understand how much this sucks for 100% lifetime mac users. The more people coming over to this side, the more it sucks. Ifeel like Idon't want to share the good stuff. If we get anywhere near 50% of the market, we will no longer have the \"virus free\" thing. THe only reason we are virus free is be cause viruses come from nerds, nerds are lazy, and the payoff for writing a virus for the mac is not worth the effort. Such sad sad times... Comment: From: mylar Jun 05, 05 - 11:04 am Macs are tightly designed for security. Popularity is not the reason for viruses on Windows. Comment: From: Mac Vati Jun 05, 05 - 12:05 pm Iwas suprised at the percentage of Macs versus WinTel.  I'll bet one big reason for it is how many of us get our Macs setup the way we like and run them.  And run them.  And run them--for MANY YEARS without the need to rush out and buy the newest version of Windows or Office.  My main machine is a blue and white G3 on which Irun 10.2.8.  It works, it works great, so Iam happy.  Istayed with 9.2 for years, and still occassionally use it when Ineed to run my copy of Illustrator.  Know anyone who still boots to Windows 3.1 to do some work?  Ithink not.  Macs just work, and the people who own them own them for years.  Just look at the used computer market--there are many used Macs for sale that go for real money--because they are worth something.  Ihave seen businesses throwing away their 1.8 Ghz WinTels becuase they weren't fast enough anymore. Comment: From: JJ Jun 05, 05 - 12:17 pm If 16% of all computers are macs, and mac users buy 30% more software - how come only 18% of software is sold for macs? Doesn't add up, does it? Comment: From: hackhardware Jun 05, 05 - 12:24 pm Why WOULD someone target a mac? Most of them have no use to hackers either way. Adware's prolly smart enough to stay away too. Plus most people who have a mac back it up, so no one would ever think about exploiting it. So if no one that has a mac exploits it, there will never BE any way to get into one. Comment: From: www.cancun.net Jun 05, 05 - 01:20 pm We recently changed mostly all our office computers to Mac, however Istill dubt the install base really is 16%, at least not on a worldwide scale. Iam located in Mexico, and it is really hard to find macs anywhere. Iwould assume that to be the case in most other latin countries as well as huge markets such as China, India, and so on. If the numbers are for US alone they are also probably too high - mostly all the privately owned macs we in our company have bought was obtained on trips to the US as that is about 40% cheaper compared to buy the same machines here. That said, Ilove the Macs, and look forward to see more Macs here in Mexico as well! Comment: From: mike Jun 05, 05 - 03:00 pm You guys forget what these percentage numbers are referring to. The 10-15% number deals with people actually using macs. the lower 2-4% numbers you see have to do with the market share of units sold each year. So, you people are talking past each other w/o any real knowledge of what is being discussed. Simple math: Last time Ilooked there were 25-30 million mac users and there are 240 - 300 million PC users. so that equeates to ~10% of all users use macs. Remember mac users do NOT upgrade there systems as often as PC users do. The average upgrade cycle for PC users is every 2-3 years. For mac users it is every 4-5 years. Comment: From: Hacyon Jun 05, 05 - 04:28 pm The logic here doesn't really follow.  Iuse Linux, Idon't use a Mac, and Idon't use Windows, but Istill don't have any viruses. Comment: From: solprovider Jun 05, 05 - 04:44 pm For the mathematically challenged: Mac users buy 30% more = 16 * 1.3 = 20.8 Other users buy 0% more = 84 20.8 / (20.8 + 84) = 19.8% of software sold 19.8% = \"over 18%\" (from the article) -- The big news is that Mac sales are growing.  Mac sales have been steady for years. Macs tend to be used for a very long time (>5 years).  Apple's sales growth is from people switching, either for better integration with iPods, or to escape from Windows viruses.  Apple is also capturing the nerd market because OSX allows computer-literate types to run their favorite (Unix/Linux/BSD) software. The WinTel market is sustained by people buying new computers because their current computer is \"broken\", usually meaning it has enough viruses/malware to slow below usability.  Many do not realize they could just clean out the malware or reinstall, do not have the ability to do either, and know the computer will just be reinfected, so they buy a new one hoping this one may be protected slightly better.  Without these sales-from-ignorance, the only Windows sales would be for hardware failures.  With the quantity and severity of the viruses and auto-installing malware over the last few years, many people are upgrading for the third time since 2001 (when Microsoft granted every virus writer's dreams by releasing WindowsXP.)  These are the people who are ready to try a Mac. Note: Many computers running Linux are counted in Windows sales because it is still almost impossible to buy an Intel (or AMD) computer without Windows. Comment: From: Jun 05, 05 - 06:46 pm Do Macs really last all that long?  My Quadra 840, on which Iam writing this, is only eleven-and-a-half years old (1993 December). I DID re-install my System 7.6.1 about two years ago.  Even then, it is something originally 'customized' years ago--Ijust make a copy so a 're-install' consists of making a copy... Inow, because of \"Where is the software??\" problems, keep most apps in the {apple} menu.  So Iplan to make an entirely new 7.6.1 set.  Isuspect that Iwill never make another significant change.  (The coming version will be my third.) In the time Ihave been using the 840 (since about 1998, early), the Wintel people Ihave known have gone through a number of computers, replacement parts, OS scrubbings, OS failures, crappy apps, and--of course--tons of upgrades! As an engineer, and as a user for that matter, Ilike products which do their jobs properly and which do those jobs for a long time. Yes, Ihave TWO G4s.  But the DSL system has trashed the Enet interface in each of them.  My dial-up is slow(er), but it keeps going, going, going... Ihave high-fidelity audio equipment almost as old as I (Let's put it this way:  My beard is almost all gray.)  It works very well, and, yes, Iuse it often. Iwill have to replace the DSL MODEM, but it is not Macintosh/PowerMac equipment.  It is just yet another piece of modern bad design. If there IS something better than Macintosh, Isure would like to use it!!! Comment: From: Jun 05, 05 - 07:39 pm Mac Vati, you asked \"Know anyone who still boots to Windows 3.1 to do some work?  Ithink not.\" Actually, there are quite a few businesses (probably, but  this is just a guess, in line with the number of people using older versions of Mac) that still use Windows 3.1 as their primary desktop for all there staff. These businesses choose to remain on Win 3.1 because it is meeting their needs.  They are much like the Mac users still stuck at 7.2.1 and the likes.  It works, so why change. Comment: From: Ling GL Jun 05, 05 - 09:24 pm Over the years, Apple workers tell me that Iam the type of user that they hate. The reason for it: Ikeep using the same Mac year after year. Iread this article and made this response on a Mac 7500 (about 10 years old). Iam one of those who depress the market share stats. Ihave bought and upgraded software to keep the computer current. Ifinally got a Macmini for special projects that this computer couldn’t handle. So even when Apple workers complained that Ididn’t buy Apple, they recognized that Iam just one more software purchaser, which encourages software developers to write good software for the Mac, and software is as important to the long range survival of the Mac as hardware. Many old Macs are still in use, one reason is that Macs traditionally have been built more upgradable than were Wintel boxes. My Mac 7500 is a case in point, started with OS 7.5.2, now runs OS X 10.2.8. Came with 32 Meg of RAM, now has 416. Added 100T ethernet, USB and a better graphics card. Replaced two CRTs, it now sports a LCD, replaced the hard drive and the CPU is now a G3.  Not counting the CRTs, Ispent about $600 for the upgrades (about the same as it cost for a Macmini with one Gig of RAM) averaging about $60/year. With my example being multiplied many times over, it is no surprise to see an installed base far larger than sales figures would expect. How many Wintel boxes could be upgraded so cheaply to give acceptable performance a decade after purchase? Comment: From: intmktg Jun 06, 05 - 09:56 pm Has anyone managed to find any numbers regarding the following quote: \"In addition, the Software Publishers Association (SPA) estimates that 16 percent of computer users are on Macs.\" Ihave looked all over the SPA website and couldn't find anything relevant. If anyone has a link explaining how the SPA obtained this figure of \"16 percent\", Iwould be very grateful. Comment: From: JJ Jun 07, 05 - 01:55 pm Some simplified mathematics for the intellectually challenged: If there were 100 programs sold in the world, mac users would buy 18 of them. Let's assume pc users would buy only 80 of the remaining 82 programs sold. If there were 100 computers in the world, 16 of them would be macs. Let's assume that all of the remaining 84 computers are pc's. The average mac user buys 18/16 programs. The average pc user buys only 80/84 programs. (Yes, you may change the estimates if you wish.) Now, how much more is that? Divide the former with the latter, multiply it with 100 (uuh.. the wacky \"precents\") and minus 100 from that to get the delta. - What does your G5 say? My Dell says it's 18% more. And that's way less than 30%. Stupid. Comment: From: Confused Jun 10, 05 - 07:10 pm Assuming that the 16% number is true, then why do Macs make up only 3% of the computers browsing the Internet? http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp I'm sure there are many Macs that are not connected to the Internet, but that can also be said for non-Mac machines too. Comment: From: Fred Mertz Jun 15, 05 - 07:06 pm Confused, It depends on which site's stats you decide to use.  I'll bet 75% or greater of MacDailyNews' visitors are on Macs. Boing Boing is probably a much better example than yours - a more representative sample of Web surfers because their content appeals to a wider audience than W3Schools (as W3Schools explains themselves on the page to which you've linked).  Boing Boing's current stats show that 17.1 % of its visitors are Mac users.  This corroborates MDN's report above rather well. http://boingboing.net/stats/ Still confused? Comment: From: Jun 15, 05 - 07:23 pm FYI: MacDailyNews visitors' platforms: May 2005: Mac: 83.82% Windows: 15.41% Linux: 0.65% June 1-14, 2005 (some recent Slashdottings skewed visits towards Windows and Linux): Mac: 76.43% Windows: 21.41% Linux: 1.96% On average in 2005, MacDailyNews is about 80-85% Mac and about 15-20% \"other\" platforms. Comment: From: zupchuck Jun 15, 05 - 07:40 pm Iwas feeling deja vu about this and then noted the dates on the postings.  Why the re-dating of the headline? Comment: From: Jun 15, 05 - 08:15 pm Sorry to say it, but these are bogus organizations, and the numbers are identical to some bogus press releases that came out years ago. Don't believe everything you read, even if it sounds wonderful. Comment: From: perfusionista Jun 16, 05 - 11:28 am \"Some simplified mathematics for the intellectually challenged:\" What your exercise tells us is that the 84% of PC users are only buying 72% of the software, not your assumption of 80%. These three numbers (30%, 16%, 18%) come from three different sources, so of course they're not going to neatly match up in an equation. But they all point to a concept: Mac usage is far greater than the 2% annual CPU sales generally quoted. That's an intellectual challenge some seem to be unable to meet. Spelling is also an intellectual challenge for Dell, it would appear...

Don't worry though, maybe someday mac sales will hit 25 or 30% and some virus making computer hacker will give some attention.  Apple just needs to keep marketing their company with hip and trendy commmercials so simple minded people will continue to purchase products that match their new ipods! Comment: From: janiewc Jun 01, 06 - 03:42 pm Let me get this straight...Hot Molly wants to use a Mac Book to run Windows all day? Ipersonally hope she buys a Dell. That way she can feel smug in her complete Windows emersion experience. Next she'll whine that she misses the pop ups and spyware. Comment: From: Richard Smith Oct 18, 06 - 03:56 pm Don't quite understand where you pull the 16% figure from, almost two out of every ten computer users owns a mac?.  Apples turnover would be far far higher than it is now, most recent growth can be placed on the ipod and some spillover with people then going onto buying the mac for a desktop computer.  IDT's own studies from 2001, 2003 and 2005 show a consistent market share of around 3-4% the 2005 results showed that Linux had surpassed the mac as far as desktop users by approx 0.2%, this growth is inline with the other years results showing a steady growth."}]}

Work-up: order\niron, ferritin, transferrin, and if possible a red cell distribution width\n(RDW). 2. Iron deficiency: On physical exam, look for koilonychia, atrophic tongue. \nIron deficiency usually does not cause a microcytic anemia until the hematocrit\ndrops below 30%.  Ferritin is useful for diagnosing iron deficiency. The\nlikelihood ratios are as follows: for a ferritin <15 the LR=50 in favor of\niron deficiency anemia; for a ferritin <25 the LR=10, specificity of 98%;\nfor a ferritin >100 the LR=0.1. Since ferritin is an acute phase reactant,\nsome say it should not be used in the setting of inflammation; others say that\nin chronic inflammation a ferritin < 50 is highly suggestive of iron\ndeficiency.  Iron is low and transferrin or TIBC (total iron binding\ncapacity) is high, which makes the transferrin saturation (iron divided by\ntransferrin) low: a saturation <10% has a specificity of 88%. The RDW\n(reflecting anisocytosis) is high. Once youve made the diagnosis, rule out GI\nbleeding: around 60% of patients will have GI lesions. Order stool guiaics, a\ncolonoscopy, and possibly an EGD.  With treatment, the hematocrit should\nbe normal in 2 months; continue iron treatment 4-6 months to replete stores.\nCommon side effect of oral iron is constipation.  IV iron available if\npatient refractory to PO, but has increased risk of anaphylaxis. Each PRBC\ntransfused contains 200 mg elemental iron. 3. Sideroblastic anemia: hereditary cases are usually microcytic while acquired\nsideroblastic anemia may be normocytic. Acquired causes include lead, INH,\nEtOH, B 6 deficiency. Basophilic stippling and dimorphic RBC\nmorphology is seen on peripheral blood smear. 4. Thalassemia: The Mentzer index may be helpful: (MCV/RBC count) < 13 favors thalassemia\nover iron deficiency.  This test has a high sensitivity but low\nspecificity.  Basically in iron deficiency, the marrow cant produce RBCs\nand theyre small so the RBC count will be low along with the MCV.  In\nthalassemia, RBC production is preserved, though the cells are small and\nfragile.  So the RBC count is normal with a low MCV.  This concept\nmay be more helpful than remembering the Mentzer index.  The RDW in\nthalassemia, unlike iron deficiency, is normal and may be a more accurate\ndiscriminant function in differentiating between the two.  Make the\ndiagnosis of beta-thalassemia with hemoglobin electrophoresis.\nAlpha-thalassemia will not show up on electrophoresis: it is diagnosed by\nmolecular diagnostic techniques. Order an A-thal on the lab slip. Think of Alpha\nthalassemia in Asians.  Beta thal in Meditteraneans.  \nDifferential diagnosis for target cells on smear: beta thalassemia, hemoglobin\nCdisease, liver disease, beta-lipoproteinemia.  In general you should not\nsee targets in sickle cell unless they are sickle-thalassemia or sickle-C. 5. Anemia of chronic disease: Chronic inflammatory diseases, that is, such as cancer and\ncollagen-vascular diseases. Transferrin is decreased, saturation increased,\niron low, ferritin normally increased (non specific for chronic disease). The\nMCV rarely falls below 78, though the patient can become microcytic because\nthey are functionally deficient of iron. Guyatt\nGH, Oxman AD, Ali M, Willan A, McIlroy W, Patterson C.

Piwnica-Worms will analyze the molecular factors that regulate a cell's decision to divide into two daughter cells. When regulation goes astray, cells divide unrestrainedly into tumors. In some ways, a cell resembles a new-fangled car that won't move until the driver is buckled in. Acell divides only if molecular sensors detect that its genetic material, DNA, is ready. Having undamaged DNA is crucial prior to division because DNA provides the molecular blueprint daughter cells need to survive. Piwnica-Worms will clarify how the two major DNA sensors help cells make the division decision. These sensors, which are similar in yeast cells and human cells, check for damage to DNA and check whether the DNA has been faithfully duplicated. Piwnica-Worms will study how two factors regulate a component of the DNA damage sensor, a protein called cell division cycle molecule 25C (Cdc25C). When DNA is in good shape, Cdc25C activates another protein that switches on cell division. Her laboratory previously helped identify proteins called Chk1 and Cds1 in human and yeast cells that prevent Cdc25C from activating the switch if a cell's DNA is damaged or not faithfully replicated. Piwnica-Worms will study how Chk1 and Cds1 interact with Cdc25C. The molecular switch, Cdc2, also is regulated by other proteins. Piwnica-Worms will determine whether a regulator called Wee1 in human and yeast cells keeps the switch from working when division is inappropriate. The Wee1 protein is found in the nucleus, where sensors are thought to evaluate DNA's readiness for cell division. But a regulator found outside the nucleus in cells of humans and other many-celled organisms might inhibit Cdc2 activity early on. Piwnica-Worms hopes to discover which regulator plays this role and whether the regulators act on other proteins. She also will study mutated forms of the second regulator to determine how it interacts with targets. This work could reveal a way to keep Cdc2 outside the nucleus, preventing it from triggering cell division. \"If you could keep Cdc2 out of the nucleus,\" Piwnica-Worms says, \"cells such as cancer cells would never divide.\" The research also might suggest other ways to kill cancer cells. For example, it might suggest ways to disable the DNA damage sensor to make cancer cells divide when they can’t survive. Piwnica-Worms notes that a drug that acts in this way is currently in early clinical trials. In other work, she also will study interactions between the sensor components that evaluate DNA duplication and those that detect DNA damage. Piwnica-Worms already helped identify an inhibitor of Cdc25C that is important at both checkpoints. ###"}]}

We went through so much change last year, so many good and wonderful things happened but somehow only the negative stuff made it into the blog - so much so that Ifelt it became a bit toxic and Ihad to walk away. The shower has always been my thinking spot and in last night's shower Ithink Ihit on the reason why the blog got so ick. We moved last year into the most wonderful neighborhood you can possibly imagine. Imean, it's the one that they make real estate commercials about. It's not my ideal house, I've always dreamed of the classic colonial but when we found this one there was so much else that was right - that Iquietly but willingly kissed my dreams of brick and columns and banistered staircases goodbye. Ifelt a vibe from this house from the beginning despite the fact that our realtor was sure I'd hate it. And there was a lot to hate - the whole dame interior was PINK. This blog is the exact shade of pink that my entire house was. But Igot a vibe. This house knew me, and Iknew it. Igot a vibe. What we didn't know is that we were getting the perfect street as well. And so many new and wonderful friends. And roots. We'd moved so many times that we'd stopped thinking about roots. We'd lived in this same town for 3 years now and maybe we knew 5 more people than when we first got her. We didn't bother putting down roots because we expected to move again. But we stayed in town and started putting down roots. And what Irealize now that it's gentle work creating roots. You do it with great care. And on some level Ithink Iwas afraid to blog about the connections and friendships Iwas making. They were new and fragile and beautiful and they had to be protected. It was such new territory for me making real, actual people you see everyday type friends. Ididn't want to mess it up. Iwas being protective of them. They are not computer geeks, they do not blog, the have not presented themselves to the internet for inspection. The ladies are also stay at home moms. And that scared me. My experiences with stay at home moms hadn't been that positive in the past. In general they didn't seem to want to let the working mom's be a part of their club. So Iwas a little shy on that front as well but really wanting everything to work out. Blogging about it didn't seem like the best way to bridge the gap. Then there was the fact that Iwas learning be the mother of more than one child and learning how to manage and juggle and make sure that both children felt their mother was meeting their needs. Blogging about Pbut not S, or Sbut not P, made me feel guilty. What if they wasn't something Iwanted to say about both of them on any given day? So with all this goodness and fun happening all around only the bad stuff was making it into the blog. Iwas ranting, and venting, and pissing, and moaning. And Ihated it. Now that Ifeel like I've got a handle on what went wrong Ithink Ican steer myself towards things that 1) excite me enough to write about 2) still fit in the comfort zone of what Ifeel Ican write about. I've ordered this book to help me with ideas as well. And Ifeel like I'm on track, Ihave a plan, I'm moving forward.... So, do you want to know what Ihad for lunch today?

Neither major party has a program for significant constitutional and\npolitical change. e/ The notion that\na government can be enterprising - and enabling - itself is the antithesis of\nthe view that only private enterprise can deliver economic recovery, jobs and\nfuture prosperity for Australia.

Underfoot, bunchgrass and sage. Overhead,\nendless stars. Slim Davis and Iwander in the twilight toward his back-forty,\nin  the direction of the western hills. From Daviss ranch, a few\nmiles west of Red Deer,  the bulk of the Rockies rises 100 miles away,\nlooking like the shoulders of some ancient sleeping behemoth. Up through\nthe shadows sails an apparition. Adark equine shape, pony-size. She seems\nsmall by any standard . cont'd Slim\nDavis 1908-2002 :\" They\ngot a right to live, that's all.\" Rare\nphoto of wild ponies near Red Deer, Alta.They're small and scruffy. Quiet,\nquiet. The mare steps through the dark. She whinnies her pleasure at Daviss\nfamiliar scent,  flinching  for a few seconds, unsure of my presence.\nDavis reaches out a reassuring hand, running it lightly up her side, over\nher mottled gray spots, up the quivering neck. Combing his fingers through\nthe tangled shag on her neck, he whispers to me, in the darkness, These\nhere are witches tails, these tangles. Theyre from when the witches ride\nem at night. Only the real wild ones have em. Thats how you tell. Daviss wild mare is\nlikely the only true mustang (Mustang - from the Spanish, monstrenco -\nroving, rough, wild) in captivity. True to her spirit, she escapes regularly,\nbut she always comes back to him. The wild instinct is in her. Inever\ndid break her, he laughs. The species the mare represents is typically\nsmall in stature, with a stocky build, large head and flowing mane and\ntail almost reaching the ground. Her kind are  plain rugged, hardly\nthe Hollywood movie version of the Western horse. Their rough-cast stoutness\nis the very quality that has allowed them  to survive the fierce strenuousness\nof the Old West and the less picturesque cruelties of modern times. Certain wildlife officials\nand sport hunters have claimed the wild horses of Western Canada are merely\nferal -  just  runaway packing horses from old logging and mining\ncamps. But Daviss lean, scruffy\nponies of the foothills are indeed the true item. His mustangs are the\ntough, rough mares and stallions of legendary Indian days, not at all like\nthe bovine scrags  commonly called mustangs by some. Unfortunately, Albertas\npopulation of feral  runaway horses hogs the public attention \nthat ought to go to the real mustangs. Most notably, the runaways roaming\nthe fenced-in grasslands of CFB Suffield,  northwest of Calgary, have\nbeen made famous by highly publicized protests over a 1988  roundup.\nProtestors mistakenly called the heavy Suffield horses mustangs. In fact, \nthe feral horses of Suffield, with their mixed Shire,  Suffolk and\nClydesdale bloodline, are no more mustangs  than Old Bessie. Their\nclaim on Western heritage is dubious. If anyone knows the\nmustangs, Davis does. He has been their advocate for decades,  having\nbeen instrumental in persuading the Alberta government in 1974 to stop\nissuing seasonal licences to hunt them. Still, he says, Its something\nterrible what theyve done to them horses. Theres not too many left. Theyve\nbeen hunted and chased, and killed. Theyre scattered and gone. Nobody\nseems to care about the mustangs, says Davis, including even the Humane\nSociety, who, he says, should do something about the condition in which\nhorses often arrive at auction houses. Theyre too often delivered to auction\nbleeding, crippled, and blinded by  their frantic struggling against\nthe leg snares hunters use to trap them, says Davis. Davis, born in 1908 to a horsemans\nfamily, grew up  alongside the Blood, Blackfoot, Cree and Stoney Indians\nof  Alberta, peoples whose traditional history and culture began and\nended  with the tough little mustangs of the wild. In 1920,  Slim first\nencountered the wild ponies. In those days wild horses numbered in the\ntens of thousands in the Alberta foothills.  This ol Indian said \nthe little horses had been there as long as the Indians could remember,\nand probably long before, he said. The Indians told him no one\nwas certain where the  horses had come from, historically speaking,\nbut they knew that the horses figured big in ancient legends. The American West had once\nbeen a virtual wild horse dominion. As late as the turn of the 19th century,\nenormous herds of mustangs, possibly numbering in the millions,  roamed\nthe prairies alongside the immense herds of buffalo. Indian Days were Mustang\nDays. The situation a century\nlater is startling. Only a few hundred  mustangs have survived the\ntwentieth century, roving the  foothills of Alberta and B.C. Today Western Canadas\nwild  horses are hunted, scalped, and\nskinned like muskrats. Nature and history\nhave colluded to make the remaining few mustangs the most aloof of creatures. \nTheir continued survival  depends on their need to remain free. They\nliterally cant survive in captivity, as they will themselves to die\nin  conditions of confinement or duress. * Snares\nused by hunters would sometimes break the mustang's legs"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Modern archaeology looks to fossil remains\nfrom sediments in Wyoming suggesting that Equus Caballus, the horse, was\nnative to North America 60 million years ago. The  horse alternately\nappears and disappears from the fossil record at about one million year\nintervals. All trace of  the horse is lost by about 25,000 years ago.\nThe species was unknown to the American continent when  Columbus sailed\nfrom Spain on his voyage of discovery. But  historians say that\nColumbus , and even the subsequent Spanish explorers, Coronado and DeSoto, \ncouldnt themselves have reintroduced the  lost species to North America.\nThey argue that, although the earliest Spanish explorers did indeed bring\nhorses with them to the New World, they brought only limited  numbers\nof the animals, and very few of those were mares.  Coronado, for example, \nwrote in his diary that he had brought five  hundred and fifty-eight\nhorses, two of them mares. Two mares could hardly have stocked the whole \ncontinent,  say historians. More likely sources for the\nNorth American population of ponies, say historians, were stock-raising\nranches established by the Spanish in the Santa Fe area between the 1550s\nand the 1700s. The ranches furnished ideal conditions for the spread of\nhorses to the rest of the continent : friendly contact with the Indians\nthrough trade, an ample supply of horses, and plenty of opportunities for\nthe Indians to study possible uses for the new creature. Logically, the movement of\nhorses into the North Americas would have followed established  inter-\ntribal trade routes. From Spanish records we know that, beginning around\n1600, southwest tribes such as the Utes, Comanches, Apaches and Kiowas\nbegan raiding the Spanish ranches and stealing large numbers of horses.\nFrom those  tribes, the horses slowly spread across the continent.\nLa Verendrye reported that tribes living northeast of the  Black Hills\nin Montana had no horses when he visited them in 1738. Yet just 16 years\nlater in 1754 Anthony Henday, the Hudsons Bay Company explorer, met Assiniboines\nin the same area who had horses, though they used them only for packing,\nnot for riding. By 1766 Henday reported numerous Assiniboines now skillfully\nriding the horses. Several Indian tribes have\noral traditions chronicling their first acquisition of horses : Tetons\nsay they got theirs from the Arikaras; Shoshonis from Comanches, and Nez\nPerces from Shoshonis. In\n1827 an American trader, Robert Meldrum, reported that old Crow people\ntold him their generation was the  first generation of Crows to see\nhorses. So it was that the hardy Spanish\nponies gradually populated the North American continent, as possessions\nof the native peoples. Wild herds of escapees were\nreported by the late 1800s, though they were mostly ignored by the Indians,\nas  domestic ponies were plentiful and easier to handle. Eventually horse- stealing\nbecame the foremost means to  acquire more horses, and full blown\nhorse culture was in full swing among the Indian tribes by the end of\nthe century. The Indian pony - small, squat  and  tough - \nbecame the mainstay of Indian life, indispensable in transport, warfare,\nleisure, hunting, religion and trade.     So it was\npractically inevitable that Indians began to measure wealth by the number\nof horses a man owned. The number of horses owned by individual Indians\ngrew dramatically. Ute father\nand son  riding their ponies ca.1870. Notice the mustang's \"fox\nears\" and heavier forequarters,  typical mustang\nconformation . Among the Piegan people the horse-to-people\nratio grew from about 1-1 in 1860 to 3.5-1 by 1895. But a wealthy individual\nmight easily have as many as 500 horses in his personal herd. In the Indian\neconomy, if a man had a lot of horses, he had prestige, and could thus\nattract more wives, have more children, produce more meat and produce more\ntrade goods. Aman with a substantial herd was affluent. The summer of 1886 was\na hot one on the prairies, just 22 years before Slim Daviss birth in Carmangay,\nAlberta.  That year saw the last major horse-raiding party of the\nOld West. Canadian Piegans rode down out of the Calgary area to the Pryor\nCreek area of northern Montana. They made off with 60 horses stolen from\nthe Crows camped there. To this day a mysterious herd of wild horses is\nknown to exist in the Pryor Mountain area. Some Crows say these horses\nmust be descendants of  the surviving stock of the Custer battle at\nBighorn, which took place just a few miles away. * Wild Horses spotted in the Chilcotin\nDistrict of British Columbia, where legal slaughters took place in the\n1980s. Maddeningly, it is the argument\nover the bloodline of the wild horses that is used today by sport hunters\nand commercial hunters to rationalize their slaughter.What are you protecting\nanyway? asked Gerry Kemp, senior wildlife management biologist with the\nAlberta lands and forests  department in 1974. So-called wild horses\nare only the  descendants of work animals from farms, or lumbering\nor  mining operations that have been turned into the wild and \nsurvived. The best thing\nthat could be done with wild  horses would be to shoot em all said\nKemp. Mustangs have, accordingly,\nbeen shot for target practice, bated with poison for predators, slaughtered\nfor dog food, chased and tormented - subjected to every kind of maltreatment\nknow to man. Objections have been raised  on the grounds of cruelty,\nbut professional wild horse hunters shrug their critics off. Round em\nup, and shoot a tranquilizer into them, and those horses dont give a damn\nwhether they end up as dog food or rodeo buckers, one big game hunter\nremarked to a Calgary reporter. In the 1950s, the slaughter\nreached high gear when hunters discovered that the horses could be panicked\nby dive-bombing airplanes. Terrified horses were buzzed from above, and\nraced  cross-country until, at the point of exhaustion, they could\nbe driven into corals. Frantic, the horses were  loaded into waiting\ntrucks for transport to auction or slaughterhouses. Many would arrive at\nthe slaughterhouse  already dead, trampled to death in transit. It\nwas not an  uncommon sight to see the trucks dripping blood on the \nhighways. Some of the trampled\nhorses had simply dropped dead of fright. Mustangs have this peculiar will to die - so  sensitive and vulnerable\nare they to pursuit and capture.  Explorer David Thompson documented\nthis  amazing vulnerability of mustangs as early as 1809. He wrote\nin his diary  while crossing the West that wild horses froze as if \nparalyzed when his men merely shouted a halloa and dashed at them. He\nwas only the first of many horse  runners to report the phenomenon.\nModern hunters still  observe that stallions, in particular, commonly\nseem  unable to survive the ordeal of being captured and will \nto die within hours or days of being deprived of their  freedom. Whole\nbands have collapsed in paroxysms of fear  when subjected to the experience\nof being rounded up and corralled. Chief  forester in 1959\n, W.R. Hanson said, They [protesters] talk about inhumane  methods,\nor protest emotionally to the government against  the extinction\nof one of the features of the old wild  west...[but] there is nothing\ncruel about the airplane  roundup. The only part you might have doubt\nabout is the  loading of the frightened animals onto trucks. \nNevertheless,  the dive-bombing bloodbaths were brought to an end\nin 1959. Forest conservation officials felt pressured  by  public\ncries for more compassionate treatment of  the mustangs, and, magnanimously,\ndecreed that roundup by cattle horse, not by dive-bombers,  was the\nonly humane way to go. The\nnumbers of  mustangs has been in dispute for more than a century. \nA 1895 police census showed 42,257 wild horses on the range in Southern\nAlberta. In 1958 a roundup expert said huge tracts of Alberta land carried\nvast wild horse herds. The whole place is a wild horse kingdom, said\nChester Utter in a report in The Albertan newspaper in August, 1958. Utter\nboasted that he alone had rounded up more than 40,000 horses. One year\nlater, in 1959, the Calgary Herald carried a front-page story saying the\nhorses were facing extinction. The next year, 1960, the Alberta Cattlemens\nAssociation said there were some 3,000 still roaming at will. By 1977,\nThe Herald thought that about 1,000 head of wild horses roamed the foothills.\nIn 1991 Alberta Fish and Wildlife counted 300 mustangs roaming free in\nKananaskis Country. In 1974, Calgary Socred MLA\nArt Dixon agreed with  the mid-70s figure of about 1,000, but argued\nthat if  the annual hunt continued the horses would soon be wiped \nout. Spurred on by Slim Davis and the thousands of names he had collected\non a petition, Dixon successfully lobbied the Alberta legislature to \nstop the regular issuing of hunting permits for wild horses. With this regulatory move\nin 1974, horses roaming on  Crown lands in Alberta could no longer\nbe legally hunted. But horses straying onto private lands were, and still\nare,  treated  as fair game for hunters, in season year- round. Aprivate members bill passed\nby the Klein government in 1993 making the capture of horses on public\nland more  than just a minor regulatory infraction  merely re-jigs\nthe 1974 regulation. Mustangs that make the horrible mistake of straying\nonto private property are still legal prey for hunters in Alberta. In B.C., in 1988 the Vancouver Sun\nreported three herds of  mustangs ranging the Chilcotin district .\nThe largest of the herds, the Red Brush herd, numbered 150. Two smaller\nherds, the Bidwell\nand Haines Creek herds, were legally massacred in 1988, reducing their\ncombined  numbers from well over 100 to 35. Regional wildlife \nofficials authorized the 1988 roundup, claiming the horses  were reducing\nvaluable grazing land during a severe  drought. Wild horse lovers passionately\nchallenge hunters claims that most mustangs are  just feral rejects,\nnot living descendants of heritage stock. American\nwild horse advocate Hope Ryden attacked the  feral argument in the\n1970s.  Ryden, who worked as   features producer for ABC\nNews from 1966 to 1968, argued  persuasively in her book Americas\nLast Wild Horses  that the very fact that these horses have prevailed\nfor so  long against so many odds - hunters, bitter weather, rough \nterrain, extensive grazing competition and high infant  mortality \n- suggests that they must come from  exceptionally hardy stock, namely,\nthe Spanish stock of  the original Indian ponies. Rejects from domestic\nherds, she argues, would never have survived over the years under \nsuch conditions. It was the animal that\nwas originally  the most Western that survived the harsh test of\nthe  wild. The big, slow gentle farm horses and the high - strung,\ngrain-fed horses were not creatures that could  easily adapt to bleak\nhabitats and rugged winters, wrote Ryden. Ryden further warranted the\npurity of the mustang pedigree based on the fact that there has been no\ngenetic  break in the continuity of the wild horse bloodline from\nthe last century to this century. Since  the West was opened, she\npointed out, though the total  number of wild horses has dwindled\ndrastically the wild  horse population did not at any time vanish.\nTherefore, she said, the mustang bloodline  extends perfectly from\nthe 16th century to present day. From Columbus to Slim Daviss mare - one\nunbroken genetic heritage."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "* In one corner, romantics and \nheritage advocates;  in the other,  ranchers seeking to protect\ngrazing  lands and hunters serving the horsemeat markets.  In\nthe middle, a sparse population of excruciatingly\nshy broomtails roving the hills of Alberta and B.C. Are there only 300?\nOne thousand? Thirty-five? Really, Slim Davis sums it\nall up : Ispent a lot of time in the mountains in the last 50 years\nor so. The wildlife is nearly gone. Its four years since  Iseen\na mountain goat. There are some mountain sheep  left, but with all\nthe trophy sheep huntin now, theyll  be gone soon, too. Now its\nthe horses.

Still,\nhe felt the slaughter was a necessary thing. Nevertheless, he admitted,\nSometimes they look you in the eye and you wonder if you should pull the\ntrigger. But its over in a second."}]}

Toback's an odd bird:  a spoiled rich kid who insinuated himself into the black counterculture back in the late 1960's while gambling himself into serious debt *and* running up a tab of sexual conquests that would make Wilt Chamberlin break out his calculator.  He also allegedly took the biggest hit of LSD in recorded history (the annals of drug history being so scrupulously reliable).  In other words, the motherfucker lived his ass off, and, for over twenty years, these lurid exploits were often the fuel for great screenplays (e.g. THE GAMBLER, FINGERS and BUGSY) that captured life dangling over the precipice.  Iadore FINGERS; it's im pure male id spurted out at 24fps about a schizophrenic concert pianist/thug (Harvey Keitel) who bears a bruising resemblance to the filmmaker himself.  It's got a Cassavetes-esque wildness about it, though it's absent the indie pioneer's humanism.  There isn't a kind bone in FINGERS' body; it's a masterpiece of misanthropy that enrages as much as it dazzles.  If you've never seen it, do so.  (Working up a head of steam writing about it, I'm wishing Ihad a copy at the ready myself.) Even when Toback is overbearing, which is always, he gets such nakedly honest performances out of his lead actors that the films, ostensibly personal statements for the writer/director, become dual confessionals.  Most people either love or hate TWO GIRLS AND A GUY; despite Natasha Gregson Wagner's most useless performance in a career littered with them, Ithink it's a phenomenal high wire act by Robert Downey, Jr., who rescues Toback's worst writing impulses with one of the great virtuoso film performances of the last twenty years.  Watching him as he flits about his Manhattan loft bellowing the first movement of Vivaldi's GLORIA or banging out a flamboyant rendition of \"You Don't Know Me' at the piano while ineptly playing traffic cop in the two-car pileup that is his love life is to see a limitlessly talented actor redline it for ninety minutes.  It's the performance people had been waiting to see Downey, Jr. give for years, and selfishly hoping he'd get around to before killing himself.  (Thankfully, he's still with us, though it's been since WONDER BOYS that he brought his \"A\" game.) If Toback's ear was getting a bit tinny with that film, he went stone cold tone deaf with BLACK AND WHITE, which felt like Toback trying to reassert his hipster cred within the African-American community by casting every hip-hop or sports star available.  Most of the Wu-Tang Clan shows up, as does Mike Tyson, but Toback the filmmaker does not, and the film collapses into a heap of disconnected scenes that are only occasionally amusing (e.g. Robert Downey, Jr. risking his life in the name of improv by propositioning Tyson).  It's the kind of disaster that would've made for a great behind-the-scenes documentary.  Unfortunately, one has not emerged. Toback followed BLACK AND WHITE up with HARVARD MAN, which was so slipshod in its execution Ididn't think him capable of a more dubious achievement.  And that brings us back to WHEN WILL I BE LOVED.  Once again, Toback trots out his famous friends -- Damon Dash, Mike Tyson and Lori Singer -- to show us that he's -- yes, Lori Singer -- still a man about town.  Meanwhile, he's investigating the balance of power in male/female relationships, and how it's predicated by material wealth.  Or something.  To tell you the truth, Ilost interest early on when Frederick Weller got into an exposition-crammed screaming match with some bimbo on Times Square.  Though there was always an element of the undisciplined about Toback, he was never this clumsy in setting up his narrative. But Ikept it on mostly for the prurient pleasure of watching Neve Campbell in the buff, not to see her get shtupped by Dominic Chianese (the only kind of fucking Iwant to see Uncle Junior doing is the figurative sort).  As for Toback, you may still be living the wild life at sixty, but your dispatches from the edge have gone from exhilarating to pathetic.  It's an act that's no longer becoming.  Time to keep it to yourself, man. 08:25 PM | Permalink | Comments (0)"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jim Garrison Once Did Fifty Minutes on THE TONIGHT SHOW"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "And James Wolcott is correct:  in today's contentious, soundbite climate, this would be unthinkable.  Read his link to Rigorous Institution , as well.

And this is a favor how? Well, if you're as unabashed a fan of Harlin's idiotic, logic-flouting sequel as Iam, you can read the homage as Richet signaling his crass, audience pleasing intent.  In fact, you'd really better read it as such; otherwise, you're in for a long, tedious journey through an exhaustive compendium of 1980's action film cliches that might be serving some greater thematic purpose if you make the mistake of looking too closely .  Granted, the gritty seriousness of the opening prologue, in which Roenick inadvertently sacrifices his undercover colleagues during a drug buy gone bad, and its Detroit setting get things off to a rollicking, NARC-ish start, but the minute the grinding mechanics of the plot kick in, and we realize that the information imparted in that prologue could've been handled with one simple perception shift in the police station set-up, we know immediately that we're watching trash.  The question is whether it's moronic or self-aware trash. This is where someone might be tempted to take me to task for suggesting that Renny Harlin has a self-aware bone in his burly Finnish body, to which Isay \"Samuel L. Jackson in DEEP BLUE SEA.\"   Obviously, there's something subversive going on in the guy's shamelessly lousy pictures, and that \"something\" is what Richet has deigned to ape to modestly diverting returns.  Call it the ROAD HOUSE principle:  if the filmmaker doesn't insult our intelligence by putting on airs, we'll gladly roll in the muck with him. And, aside from that unnecessary prologue, that's mostly what Richet does, obviating the narrative inefficiency of James DeMonaco's bloated script by amping up the violence and getting decent performances out of his very good ensemble (save for an annoying-from-his-first-overly-mannered-twitch John Leguizamo).  Which is not to say that this go-for-broke sensibility results in any memorable set pieces; again, like Harlin, Richet may be able to pull of a single, well-composed shot (e.g. Gabriel Byrne's confrontation with Maria Bello), but his action choreography is pretty lackluster.  Still, despite the disposability of the major sequences, they get the job done in decent workmanlike fashion. Icertainly understand Harry's enthusiasm for the film, and concede that he might be on to something with viewing ASSAULT as a hardcore throwback to 80's genre garbage (though Isee a lot more Glickenhaus than Pyun on display here).  But this film is competent in a way those films so hilariously were not.  Richet's work is strictly Harlin-ville -- not a bad place to hang out so long as you're familiar with and accepting of the terrain. 01:14 PM | Permalink | Comments (6)"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Camille Orders Cos Neutered"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These allegations are suspect, to be sure, but the famously domineering wife of the great comic can't be taking any chances at this late stage in the game.  The result may be a less aggressive, stay-at-home Cos, but the woman has a fortune to protect.  Actually, this would not be the first time such drastic measures were taken in the world of comedy; fifteen years ago, Charlie Callas revealed in his autobiography FLOP SWEAT that he mutilated his own genitals after developing a delirium inducing crush on the blonde lead dancer in Sting's \"We'll Be Together\" video.  The impact on Callas's act would prove disastrous when he inelegantly wedged the gruesome experience into his old nightclub routine to the utter horror of an unsuspecting audience at The Flamingo in Vegas.

Iwas gonna mention something earlier about how they'll probably make use of the traffic cameras posted at intersections out here in L.A.  Seriously.  But Iwas also expecting a buttload of references to Joe Pesci in THE PUBLIC EYE, so I'm not exactly batting .300 on the night. 11:30 -- Cole Hauser sadistically laying into Tom Sizemore makes this the second Mel Gibson film of last year to get off on the ceaseless beating of a Christ figure. 11:31 -- Dennis Farina and Cole Hauser regard each other.  Hot. 11:33 -- All those \"Cole Hauser's a poor man's Matthew McConaughey\" remarks I've been keeping to myself have just taken on a uncomfortably coincidental tincture. 11:34 -- Cameo of the film:  Tim Thomerson. 11:35 -- At last, Hauser can laugh with his paparazzi tormentors.  He just needed to blow off some steam by committing a few homicides.  How very Christian of you, Mel.  And just in case your obsessed ass is reading this, know that I've installed extra locks, four security cameras, and hired the dude who played Minoso Torres in DIGGSTOWN as my bodyguard.  You want my spleen, motherfucker, you better pack a lunch and a dinner, 'cause you'll be pulling a double shift.

Do a search on Amazon.com and you will find over 590 books with \"Millionaire\" in the title. Take a look at some of the most popular television shows over the past few years: Survivor (competing for $1 million), Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Joe Millionaire. The question is, how hard is it to become a millionaire through saving and investing?"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What It Takes To Become a Millionaire It may not be as hard as you think. For example, a 30-year old making $50,000 a year (plus 3% raises each year), saving 10% of their income with a 10% return each year could expect to hit millionaire status at age 59. If they work until the traditional retirement age of 65, they will have over two million dollars saved up. 10% may sound like an aggressive amount of saving, but it could be a combination of employee contributions to a 401k plus company match. What Role Does Income Play? Surprisingly, income is not as big a factor as you might think.  Using the same assumptions as above but making $100k a year, the person would become a millionaire at age 53 instead of 59. How could that be? The main factor here is what Einstein called the \"8th wonder of the world\": the power of compounding interest . Playing Catch-up? Can't Save That Much? If you are unable to save that much a year, or you are getting a late start, there is still hope. If you started at age 30, but could only save 5%, you would still become a millionaire by retirement at age 65. If you are playing catch-up and started investing at age 40, you would need to save about 11% a year to become a millionaire by age 65, but at age 50 you would have to save a nearly impossible 30% a year and your time frame would be so short that market volatility would play a bigger role in determining if you could retire or not. Is One Million Dollars Really That Much These days? Not really. Once you take inflation into account, being a millionaire today isn't as impressive as it used to be. For example, if someone was a millionaire in 1980, they would have to have about $1.9 million dollars in 2003 to match the wealth they had in 1980. Is One Million Dollars Enough to Retire On? It is. If you had one million dollars today and put the money in something safe that earns around 6% a year, you could afford to take out $60,000 a year for the next 49 years. If you wanted to be a bit more aggressive with your withdrawals and live up your retirement years, you could take out $100,000 a year for 14 years. For simplicity, these examples don't includes taxes which would decrease your lasting power, though things like social security and higher returns would increase your lasting power. Do You Have What it Takes to Become a Millionaire? As you have learned the most important factor to becoming a millionaire is to save early and rely on compounding interest. You can easily have control over how much you save, but you can't do much about performance - performance isn't reliable. You could try to make 15% a year, but may end up losing 10% a year doing so. It is better to rely on a properly diversified mutual fund portfolio earning around 10-13% a year, then to gamble and never retire.

In their letters they complained about the poor inundation, and Menemnakht  replied describing the inadequate rations he received and the difficult  work he\nhad to do. Workers were generally drafted during the time of inundation, when work in the fields was impossible.

Upon recommendation\n        of the Committee on Undergraduate Studies, and by\n        unanimous voice vote, approved the initiation of the\n        Interdisciplinary Program in Archaeology and authorized\n        the Executive Committee of the Interdisciplinary Program\n        in Archaeology to nominate candidates for the B. A.\n        degree for a period of five years, from September 1, 2001\n        through August 31, 2006. 2. Accepted the\n        1999/2000 Annual Report of the Committee on Academic\n        Computing and Information Systems, as presented by past\n        committee chair Professor Brad Osgood. SUSAN W.\n        SCHOFIELD Academic\n        Secretary to the University MINUTES,\n        JAN. 25 Call to Order Senate Chair Brad Osgood\n        called the meeting to order at 3:24 p.m. in Room 180 of\n        the Law School. There were 31 voting members, 8 ex-officio members, and a large number of guests in\n        attendance. Osgood welcomed new School of Education Dean\n        Deborah Stipek to her first Senate meeting, and she was\n        greeted with a round of applause. Approval of Minutes The minutes of the\n        January 11, 2000 meeting of Senate XXXIII (SenD#5159)\n        were approved as submitted. The Chair advised that the\n        Memorial Resolution on the agenda was being rescheduled\n        to the next meeting. Report from the Senate\n        Steering Committee Osgood thanked those at\n        SLAC for the very successful Senate meeting and tour on\n        January 11th. He joked that if the next Senate\n        \"field trip\" couldn't be to Hawaii, he might\n        try to arrange for the Athletic Director to take everyone\n        to the Final Four. Osgood informed Senate members that\n        their Fall Quarter discussion on advising had led to the\n        recent activation of the C-US Subcommittee on Residential\n        Education and Advising (S-REA). It had been charged among\n        other things to \"develop strategies for faculty\n        mentoring of freshmen and sophomores\" and to\n        \"plan a program to increase the quality of mentoring\n        at the upper levels.\" The subcommittee, chaired by\n        Professor Elizabeth Bernhardt, includes faculty members\n        Brad Gregory (History), Lynn Hildemann (Civil and\n        Environmental Engineering), Doug Osheroff (Physics),\n        Senior Lecturer Julie Kennedy (Earth Systems), three\n        students, and three ex-officio staff members.\n        Osgood indicated that Director of Undergraduate Advising\n        Lori White welcomed the assistance of the subcommittee as\n        well as input from any and all faculty members. The Chair also reported\n        that the Executive Committee of the Planning and Policy\n        Board, consisting of himself and former Senate Chairs\n        Zoback and Efron, had considered suggestions for\n        potential PPB topics, but had decided not to convene PPB\n        starting in the Fall. He said that they anticipated the\n        possibility of PPB being appointed later in the year in\n        connection with the results of the Provost's University\n        Needs Assessment process, and that they welcomed other\n        faculty suggestions. Osgood previewed upcoming Senate\n        agenda items, and reminded everyone of the annual meeting\n        of the Academic Council on March 8th. Vice Provost\n        Bravman asked what purpose was served by the \"always\n        empty Action Calendar\" on the agenda. The Academic\n        Secretary explained that degrees are conferred quarterly\n        under the Action Calendar, as well as occasional other\n        items, which are to be voted on as presented, without\n        amendment. Report from the\n        Committee on Committees CoC Chair Lipsick\n        advised that they had responded to the Provost's request\n        for faculty members to serve on a small, ad hoc committee\n        to review the maternity provisions of the tenure policy.\n        CoC had also begun its regular work of identifying\n        potential members for Fall 2001 vacancies on various\n        committees, he said, and urged faculty members to say yes\n        if asked to serve. Reports from the\n        President and the Provost The Provost was absent.\n        President Hennessy reported with relief that he had\n        filled three major administrative positions. He said that\n        \"Acting\" had been removed from General Counsel\n        Debra Zumwalt's title, following the recommendation of a\n        blue ribbon panel that examined the position. LaDoris\n        Cordell would be assuming the post of Vice Provost and\n        Special Counsel to the President for Campus Relations,\n        Hennessy said, returning to Stanford after 19 years as a\n        Santa Clara County judge. And he announced that Randy\n        Livingston would arrive in mid-March as Chief Financial\n        Officer and Vice President for Business Affairs. President Hennessy also\n        spoke briefly about the California utilities crisis,\n        explaining that Stanford has a Cogeneration plant, owned\n        and operated by a third party, that provides power to its\n        academic facilities and that sells back excess power into\n        the PG&Egrid. \"In addition to avoiding rolling\n        blackouts, we are part of the solution rather than part\n        of the problem,\" he said. The university urges all\n        members of the community to evaluate their usage of\n        electricity and to try to conserve it, making as much\n        power as possible \"available to our neighbors and\n        the rest of the state.\" Hennessy indicated that\n        Stanford's energy usage had gone up steadily for several\n        years, and that dramatic increases in natural gas and\n        electricity prices would probably result in a $5 million\n        hit to the university budget. He encouraged anyone with\n        ideas about ways to conserve energy to contact Chris\n        Christofferson, Associate Vice Provost for Facilities\n        (725-0296). Dean Orr (School of Earth Sciences) and\n        Professor Noll (Economics) joked that Stanford could\n        close down every Friday and get rich by selling\n        electricity at \"extortionist prices.\" Hennessy\n        said that unfortunately the university had a long-term\n        agreement that did not include Stanford sharing in any\n        profits. Professor Rehm (Drama)\n        advised the Senate of the formation of an informal\n        committee of Senators including himself, Debra Satz,\n        David Abernethy, Rob Polhemus, Yvonne Yarbro-Bejarano,\n        David Palumbo-Liu, Bernie Roth and ASSU President Seth\n        Newton, who wished to meet with the President and the\n        Provost about the Nike contracts with Stanford. He\n        mentioned labor problems at Nike factories, student\n        protests at several universities, a citizen lawsuit\n        supported by California Attorney General Lockyer, and\n        several recent books and articles about college\n        athletics. \"All of this puts some pressure on\n        Stanford to justify its continuing to contract with\n        Nike,\" he said. He also made \"a modest\n        proposal\" that if Stanford needs money so badly that\n        it has to sell advertising on student athlete uniforms,\n        maybe it ought to approach Nike and Adidas and Reebok and\n        \"cut a similar deal\" for clothing that all the\n        faculty would wear, like the students. Hennessy reminded\n        everyone that the university does not fund any varsity\n        sports, and that Athletics is stretched to cover its\n        budget commitments since advertising was removed from\n        venues such as Maples Pavilion. He said that he is\n        concerned that corporate sponsorship confuses the notion\n        of amateur sports at the college level, but also\n        recognizes that it is a reality to be contended with. He\n        noted that Nike had kept Stanford apprised of labor\n        issues, and he suggested that engaging with them about\n        such issues might cause them to pay more attention to\n        them. Hennessy asked Rehm and the group to meet with\n        Athletics Director Ted Leland to inform themselves about\n        athletic sponsorship agreements and relevant issues,\n        adding that \"we will be happy to meet with any\n        faculty who are concerned.\" Hennessy noted that he\n        had read the books Rehm mentioned, and recommended the\n        book by William Bowen and James Schulman, The Game of\n        Life: College Sports and Educational Values New Interdisciplinary\n        Program in Archaeology (SenD#5149) Chair Osgood commented\n        that the new interdisciplinary program recommended by the\n        Committee on Undergraduate Studies draws on existing\n        faculty strengths in Classics, Anthropology, and Geology,\n        and reflects considerable student interest. He welcomed\n        C-US Chair Hester Gelber to present the recommendation,\n        along with guests including H&S Associate Dean\n        Russell Berman and Professors Ian Morris (Classics), Ian\n        Hodder (Cultural and Social Anthropology), Gail Mahood\n        (Geological and Environmental Sciences), and John Rick\n        (Anthropological Sciences), all members of the program's\n        executive committee. Gelber advised that C-US\n        had received a recommendation to initiate the program\n        from the Humanities and Sciences Curriculum Committee and\n        deans. After discussing the degree of support available\n        from the relevant departments, the curriculum, provisions\n        for advising, and the general quality of the program,\n        they found it to be impressive and well thought through,\n        she said. Berman added that H & Sfirmly supports the\n        proposal, which emanates from the Archaeology Center,\n        funded in 1998/99 by seed money from the President's\n        Fund. He advised that H & Swas prepared to provide\n        base budget support as it came to better understand the\n        size of student interest. Professor Palumbo-Liu\n        (Comparative Literature) offered several comments,\n        including a suggestion that the foreign language\n        requirement should be set at \"B\" rather than\n        \"Bminus.\" He also asked about financial\n        arrangements for required fieldwork, encouraged more of\n        an emphasis on Asia and the Pacific Rim, and suggested\n        that the important course on ethics expand its focus to\n        include \"the effects of conquest and\n        imperialism.\" Co-Directors Morris and Hodder noted\n        that fieldwork is a central part of archaeology. It was\n        being arranged either on the Stanford campus with very\n        low cost to students, or at overseas sites, funded in\n        different ways, but generally not burdening students\n        financially, except perhaps in lost opportunities for\n        summer wages. They agreed that they would very much like\n        to become involved in Asia, \"if only we can come up\n        with a couple more faculty billets.\" Hodder\n        indicated that broad attention to various ethical\n        dimensions of archaeology in the modern world would be\n        explored in his course. Professor Shoven (Economics) said\n        that he believed the Senate should not be in the business\n        of deciding specific grade requirements for courses\n        within a program. Professor Noll\n        (Economics) commented that he strongly supported the new\n        program, but was disappointed with two aspects of the\n        proposal. First, he expressed the view that core courses\n        should be offered every year, not every other year, given\n        the propensity of Stanford students to have diverse\n        interests and commitments off campus that could lead to\n        scheduling problems in the major. Second, he said it\n        appeared to him that students would be able to fulfill\n        the major without actually acquiring interdisciplinary\n        breadth. He suggested that breadth should be required in\n        both the analytic methods and the skills courses. \"Iwould think that this program might want to produce a new\n        kind of geologist, or a new kind of classicist, or a new\n        kind of anthropologist, who was actually very skilled in\n        those other fields,\" Noll observed. Mahood said she\n        expects students to be attracted to the program at least\n        in part because of dimensions beyond anthropology, such\n        as earth sciences. She said that the program committee\n        would be thinking about further constraints in the major\n        as student interests become more clear. Hodder assured\n        Noll that the notion of breadth was firmly imbedded in\n        the faculty's vision for the program, even if it did not\n        come through in the description. Gelber noted that C-US\n        had explored similar concerns, and was satisfied that the\n        student advising process would strongly guide students to\n        make appropriate choices within the major. The following motion,\n        moved and seconded by the Committee on Undergraduate\n        Studies, was approved by voice vote without dissent: The Senate approves\n        the initiation of the Interdisciplinary Program in\n        Archaeology and authorizes the Executive Committee of the\n        Interdisciplinary Program in Archaeology to nominate\n        candidates for the B. A. degree for five years effective\n        September 1, 2001 through August 31, 2006. 1999/2000 Annual Report\n        from the Committee on Academic Computing and Information\n        Systems (SenD#5123) Senate Chair Brad\n        Osgood, having served as the 1999/2000 chair of C-ACIS,\n        handed the gavel to the Academic Secretary and stepped\n        forward to present the committee's report. Osgood\n        identified and thanked committee members and staff, and\n        indicated that C-ACIS over the years \"cycles\n        through\" discussion of basic computing issues such\n        as infrastructure, the network and its support,\n        administrative computing, general computing support, and\n        network security. He explained that for C-ACIS and the\n        other six Academic Council committees, important things\n        often happen not as formal committee actions, but rather\n        as a result of the senior administrative officers who\n        serve ex-officio being responsive to faculty\n        viewpoints and going away and \"getting things\n        done.\" Osgood summarized the main themes of the\n        prior year, emphasizing departmental computing support\n        and \"computing as a public good.\" He provided\n        some striking statistics concerning the extent of\n        computing equipment requiring some level of support at\n        Stanford: roughly 60,000 desktop machines (60% PC, 30%\n        Mac, 10% Unix); 516 subnets with 50,000 nodes; and more\n        than 100% growth in web pages and 1,000% growth in disk\n        space between 1994 and 1998. The committee had considered\n        two alternative models for \"computing as a public\n        good,\" he said -- the library model (centrally\n        funded, shared resources) versus the utilities model\n        (charges for services based on usage). Osgood noted that\n        this was a large topic, complicated by the significant\n        variations among departments, and that discussions were\n        ongoing in C-ACIS this year. Professor Paul Segall,\n        C-ACIS Chair for 2000/2001, advised that the committee\n        was dividing its agenda by quarter, focusing on teaching,\n        then research, then additional issues. He mentioned that\n        as part of the Provost's needs assessment process, a\n        subcommittee was looking at long-term infrastructure\n        needs for academic computing, and hoped that as many\n        faculty members as possible would respond to a survey to\n        be distributed in February. Segall said that in addition\n        to the ten-year horizon of the needs assessment process,\n        C-ACIS hoped to prioritize some more immediate needs, and\n        welcomed faculty input. Professor Papanicolaou\n        (Mathematics) expressed concern about increases in\n        licensing costs for the MatLab software that were\n        affecting a large number of faculty members in sciences\n        and engineering. He urged C-ACIS to take a leadership\n        role in solving the problem. Segall mentioned that an\n        ITSS staff member, Pat Box, was in charge of software\n        licensing and was attempting to negotiate with the\n        company. Professor Noll (Economics) said he sees C-ACIS\n        as having a very small net and chasing after a big\n        elephant, and he questioned whether they could ever be\n        particularly effective. Osgood stressed the role of\n        C-ACIS in oversight and as a faculty sounding board, and\n        others mentioned specific policies and actions in the\n        past few years that had resulted from the committee's\n        work. Professor Tatum (Civil and Environmental\n        Engineering) expressed the view of several faculty\n        members that information infrastructure has become\n        \"as important as clean air and clean water\" and\n        urged C-ACIS to advocate for current investments to\n        ensure long-term infrastructure adequacy. It was agreed,\n        at the suggestion of Professor Roth (Mechanical\n        Engineering), that the annual report should be corrected\n        to spell out all acronyms. The Academic Secretary\n        accepted the 1999/2000 Annual Report of the Committee on\n        Academic Computing and Information Systems on behalf of\n        the Senate, and thanked the committee for its work. Report on Staff\n        Retention and Recruitment (SenD#5158) Chair Osgood introduced\n        John Cammidge, Executive Director of Human Resources, to\n        report on staff retention and recruitment issues, a topic\n        of real interest to many faculty members. Cammidge, at\n        Stanford for eight months, advised that he wanted to\n        present and explain a good deal of data, provided to\n        Senate members in advance, and to invite all members of\n        the faculty to take an increased involvement in the\n        well-being of staff. Summarizing data\n        concerning staff turnover at Stanford, Cammidge advised\n        that Stanford's \"separation rate\" (primarily\n        voluntary departures, but also including layoff,\n        dismissal, retirement and death) is now 25.5% per year,\n        up from 10.6% in 1996. The Stanford rate mirrors that in\n        Silicon Valley, he said, but the national average is only\n        12-14%. Concerning total compensation competitiveness,\n        according to Cammidge, Stanford benefits are very\n        competitive, base compensation is generally competitive\n        at the middle of the Bay Area marketplace, and incentive\n        compensation is less competitive. He advised that the\n        highest separation rates are occurring in the academic\n        areas, and said that a consultant had quantified the cost\n        of turnover at up to $68 million annually. The causes of\n        Stanford turnover, he said, include the Silicon Valley\n        labor market, income pressures (cost of living, housing,\n        better paid opportunities), lack of career progression,\n        and issues with supervision and recognition. Continuing to summarize\n        key information, Cammidge pointed out that even though\n        the number of staff vacancies had doubled since 1996,\n        Stanford had continued to operate with a decentralized\n        recruitment process. He also noted that existing\n        supportive programs are not always used, for example\n        incentive pay, flexible scheduling, access to recreation,\n        quality of work life, and transportation opportunities.\n        Support is not consistent across the university for\n        performance management and career development, he said.\n        He also emphasized that Stanford turnover is influenced\n        by bureaucratic, inefficient work processes, poorly\n        designed or boring jobs, and job complexity without\n        adequate training. The bottom line, according to Cammidge\n        -- \"Our Silicon Valley environment is a challenge.\n        Nevertheless, we can do more to retain and recruit the\n        staff employees who support Stanford's teaching and\n        research activities.\" Cammidge presented pie\n        charts showing a total of 13,600 Stanford employees,\n        including hourly and temporary workers (but excluding the\n        Hospitals). Of that number, 6,200 are in ongoing staff\n        positions (excluding SLAC, for which he did not have data\n        but for which he said the recruitment and retention\n        problems were very similar). He showed separation rates\n        for Stanford's 15 schools and administrative units,\n        speculating that the highest separation rates were in the\n        academic areas \"not because of the faculty,\"\n        but because the percentage of lower level, primarily\n        administrative staff positions is higher there. Cammidge\n        said that Stanford's internal movement rate of only 7%\n        should be much higher -- people advancing and building\n        careers at the university -- and that everyone would of\n        course like to have significantly fewer than 25% leaving\n        Stanford. Data also show that the lower the salary, the\n        higher the turnover, he noted, reflecting cost of living\n        pressures. Cammidge expressed concern that employees with\n        three to five years of university service have the\n        highest separation rates (34%) and attributed this in\n        part to pay compression. Stanford may pay too many people\n        close to the average without differentiating enough, he\n        suggested. Discussing staff base\n        salary competitiveness within the Bay Area job market,\n        Cammidge said that Stanford's overall position was 1.1%\n        above market, and showed a slide with seven job families\n        above market, one by almost 10%, and three job families\n        below market. The specific job categories were not\n        labeled due to confidentiality issues concerning the\n        sources, Cammidge said. In response to questions from\n        Education Dean Stipek and Professor Satz (Philosophy), he\n        indicated that higher separation rates were not\n        necessarily correlated with below market salary rates,\n        and reiterated his concern that relatively uniform salary\n        administration was causing Stanford to lose its best\n        people. Cammidge presented data on the number of open\n        positions -- 638 in August 2000, almost double the number\n        four years earlier -- and indicated that \"there are\n        more job vacancies, it is taking longer to fill them,\n        there are fewer candidates, and in some cases it is\n        difficult to find qualified candidates.\" He also\n        showed a slide listing the factors cited by about 350\n        people in a Fall 1999 survey asking why they joined\n        Stanford, stayed at Stanford, and left Stanford. Moving beyond the data\n        to ask \"What lies ahead?\" Cammidge described a\n        strategic vision of Stanford as an \"employer of\n        choice\" for staff. \"Anything that touches on\n        the staff employee relationship ought to be of concern to\n        Human Resources,\" he stated. Assuming that all of\n        the basic personnel functions must be well executed, he\n        identified areas in which Stanford might strive to\n        differentiate itself externally -- quality of the work\n        environment, learning opportunities, housing assistance\n        opportunities, and work/life cycle programs -- as well as\n        areas of internal differentiation -- career\n        opportunities/talent management/meaningful work,\n        competitive total compensation, management and\n        supervisory leadership (including faculty), and the\n        Stanford community/diversity. Looking ahead 12 to 18\n        months, Cammidge expressed optimism about institutional\n        sponsorship to support a series of prioritized projects\n        involving Human Resources and user representatives as\n        well as improved HR systems and support, all geared\n        toward \"getting the right staff, treating them well,\n        and keeping them.\" He mentioned several items from a\n        list of priority projects with sponsorship, including a\n        review of staff housing needs and possible solutions\n        (looking at the Stanford West apartments, and perhaps a\n        403(b) loan product); a new employee referral program\n        patterned after very successful Silicon Valley programs;\n        and an ongoing study of childcare affordability\n        scholarships. Cammidge discussed\n        several additional items from a list of potential\n        priority projects. He asked for faculty feedback about\n        the feasibility of increasing meaningful work by\n        reviewing work processes, job design, delegated\n        authorities, and organizational structures within schools\n        and departments. He also suggested that the\n        decentralization of the employment function in the early\n        1990s should be revisited, in order to develop a Stanford\n        \"employment brand\" and to provide central\n        recruitment support for hard to fill jobs. Finally, he\n        asked whether the faculty wanted to be involved in the\n        solutions. For example, he wondered if the Faculty Staff\n        Benefits Committee should be broadened to include all\n        human resources issues. \"The basic message for me is\n        really an invitation to you to become a 'stakeholder' in\n        the well-being of Stanford's 6,500 staff members,\"\n        Cammidge concluded. Professor Zoback\n        (Geophysics) suggested that reconsideration of the recent\n        reduction in the child tuition grant benefit, which he\n        thought had saved the university one or two million\n        dollars per year, might make a significant dent in the\n        25% rate and the $68 million cost of turnover. Cammidge\n        agreed that education and training benefits in general\n        should be evaluated, including that item as well as the\n        new and underutilized program to reimburse staff members\n        themselves for college tuition. Any such programs that\n        can be designed to benefit employees directly, before\n        taxes, are very valuable, he said. Professor Noll\n        (Economics) commented that he did not believe that\n        changes in Stanford salaries and benefits over the past\n        ten years were anywhere near as important as two other\n        major changes: increased administrative accountability\n        (due to the indirect cost controversy) and\n        computerization. \"There is infinitely greater\n        accountability for everything you do, which means there's\n        a lot more work to do. And, secondly, computerization has\n        been used as a mechanism to decentralize the cost of\n        undertaking that activity from the central administration\n        to the academic and research units. The proportion of the\n        work that's done locally has been increased with no\n        change in classification level and no change in the\n        number of staff. As a result, the amount of time has gone\n        way up that department administrative staff spend proving\n        they're not criminals or satisfying some distant person\n        that they never can talk to because they only have voice\n        mail. And if you just talk to these people, they'll tell\n        you that's why they don't like their jobs.\" The\n        faculty in departments also feels these things, e.g.,\n        trying to get reimbursed for travel or to spend their\n        grant money, Noll said, but they have no real way to\n        judge how much of the increasing complexity is absolutely\n        required, or how much might have been overreacting to\n        external circumstances. H & S Dean Beasley said that\n        he agreed to some extent but also felt that the faculty\n        could play a significant role in reexamining the\n        administrative structures in their own departments and\n        schools. Professor Wooley (Electrical Engineering) agreed\n        with Noll that staff had a particularly miserable job\n        arranging for travel and reimbursement. President\n        Hennessy cautioned that the faculty often do not read the\n        rules and the difficult task of telling them \"You\n        can't do this,\" falls to the staff. Professor Tatum (Civil\n        and Environmental Engineering) commented that rules\n        concerning equity with existing employees were one of the\n        most difficult challenges in hiring new people.\n        Responding to Wooley, Cammidge indicated that the data\n        presented to Senate was public and could be shared with\n        department staff. He said that he would be delighted to\n        come to departments to discuss the issues, and Senate\n        Chair Osgood encouraged him to do so. Osgood thanked\n        Cammidge for a thoughtful presentation. Obtaining a motion and a\n        second, Osgood declared the Senate meeting adjourned at\n        5:13 p.m. Respectfully\n        submitted, Susan W.\n        Schofield Academic\n        Secretary to the University"}]}

Iran's intentions The sophistication of the Iranian threat is shown in the limited steps it proposes to take. This would involve the conversion of crushed uranium ore (yellowcake), which it already has, into uranium hexafluoride, a gas that then has to be spun in centrifuges to separate the parts needed for nuclear power. It could argue that conversion is a \"pre-enrichment\" process. That argument has already been dismissed by the European Union Three (EU3) who say that under an agreement last November, Iran agreed to suspend all enrichment \"activities\" while holding talks about agreeing \"objective guarantees\" that its future nuclear power programme would be peaceful. Why now? Quite why the threat has resurfaced at this moment is not clear. Nor is it clear why the threat was not carried out immediately. It could be that Iran thinks that its talks with the three European countries are getting nowhere and that this is a way of trying to get some progress.

Russia is itself involved in completing a nuclear power station in Iran and China buys a great deal of oil from Iran. The risk is that Iran is simply acting tactically and that strategically it still intends to master the technology of the full enrichment cycle. If that is the case, it will have to declare its hand at some stage and face the consequences. Ultimately these could go beyond UN sanctions and could involve a threat by Israel to attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Trust issue Iran argues that under the NPT, a country wanting to develop nuclear power - and that is all it wants to do, it claims - is allowed to enrich its own fuel. This is true, but Iran's problem is that the IAEA has established that it hid an enrichment programme for nearly 20 years. The US and the EU3 now argue that it cannot be trusted and must therefore not be allowed to enrich. In their view the only effective \"objective guarantee\" would be to have no enrichment at all. They reject the increased inspections that Iran is offering as inadequate. This is because the same technology used to enrich uranium to a level needed for nuclear power can also be used to enrich to a level needed for a nuclear bomb. If Iran were allowed to develop an enrichment cycle, it would be able to use the technology to make a nuclear bomb in due course, at a time of its own choosing."}]}

But the proposed license could hamper cross-pollination between Solaris and Linux and, as one commentator has it, add to a list of licenses that create \"lots of little lumps of software that can't be combined.\" Sun, however, calls its license \"less burdensome\" and seems ready to sacrifice any benefits of Linux intermingling. More stories on open-source Solaris On Wednesday evening, CNET News.com has learned, Sun submitted a description of its Common Development and Distribution License , or CDDL, to the Open Source Initiative . The nonprofit group reviews licenses and bestows official open-source status on those that meet the Open Source Definition requirements. The CDDL lets programmers see, change and distribute source code for any programming project it governs. Unlike some open-source licenses, it requires that modifications be shared as open-source software. Sun hopes its open-source move will attract developers to Solaris and reinvigorate the operating system. Solaris waned in popularity with the Internet bubble burst and with the rise of Linux, which works better on widely used servers based on x86 processors such as Intel's Xeon. But if Sun chooses to release Solaris under the CDDL--and it hasn't committed to doing so--the choice likely will prevent direct cross-pollination between the Unix variant and its prime competitor, Linux. That sharing is one of the prime advantages of the open-source philosophy; making Solaris open-source raised the possibility that it could benefit from Linux features such as widespread hardware support, and Linux could gain from Solaris features such as multiprocessor abilities. Sun's CDDL description addressed the difficulties of intermingling software covered by the CDDL with software covered by the General Public License , or GPL--the license that governs Linux. \"The CDDL is not expected to be compatible with the GPL, since it contains requirements that are not in the GPL,\" Claire Giordano of Sun's CDDL team said in its submission. \"Thus, it is likely that files released under the CDDL will not be able to be combined with files released under the GPL to create a larger program.\" Open Source Initiative President Eric Raymond declined to comment yet on whether the license meets those criteria. But if the Open Source Initiative approves the license, the CDDL will join a list that already includes dozens of licenses.

In a unanimous decision issued Monday, the nine justices said companies that build businesses with the active intent of encouraging copyright infringement should be held liable for their customers' illegal actions. \"We hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright, as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement, is liable for the resulting acts of infringement,\" Justice David Souter wrote in the majority opinion."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yes No View results The decision comes as a surprisingly strong victory for copyright companies and stands to reshape an Internet landscape in which file swapping has become commonplace. The ruling will give the recording industry and Hollywood immediate ammunition to file lawsuits against other file-trading companies. It could also be a boon for legal music services such as Apple Computer's iTunes, which could see their strongest competitor--freely downloadable songs--driven further underground. It won't immediately shut down access to the trading networks, however. The court's ruling sends the case back to the lower courts, which will review the evidence against Grokster and co-defendant StreamCast in the light of Monday's decision. Record labels and movie studios immediately hailed the decision as an unambiguous victory. \"The most important message from today's historic decision is that progress and innovation do not have to come at the expense of recording artists, songwriters and the people who make their living in the entertainment industry,\" Warner Music Group CEO Edgar Bronfman said in a statement. \"This important decision will allow artists and the creative community to prosper side by side with the technology industry.\" The peer-to-peer companies involved warned that the high court had opened the floodgates to litigation against a wide variety of technology companies, but said that they would continue to distribute their software and that they expected to be cleared of any wrongdoing. \"We are confident that it will be proven that Morpheus does not promote or encourage copyright infringement,\" said StreamCast Chief Executive Officer Michael Weiss. \"We're staying in this for the fight. We're going to continue to innovate and come out with new products.\" Cloud over Silicon Valley? The justices were reviewing a pair of lower-court decisions in which both courts said that file-swapping companies such as Grokster were not liable for the copyright infringement of people using their software. The nation's top court heard oral arguments on the case in late March. With the potential to rewrite the Supreme Court's 1984 Sony Betamax ruling that made VCRs--and by extension any technology with \"substantial noninfringing use\"--legal to sell, the decision has been closely watched across Silicon Valley. Technology companies have feared that a new copyright-focused standard aimed at controlling peer-to-peer networks might result in a rise in lawsuits aimed at blocking new products. The Betamax ruling had protected generations of products, ranging from CD burners to Apple's iPod to personal computers. In its majority ruling Monday, the court did not make any detailed changes or clarifications to that 1984 decision. However, Souter did write that the Betamax decision had not been meant as a shield for companies that actively induced or encouraged their customers to infringe copyrights. The peer-to-peer companies appeared to fall into that category, he wrote. \"There is no evidence that either company (Grokster or StreamCast) made an effort to filter copyrighted material from users' downloads or otherwise impede the sharing of copyrighted files,\" Souter wrote. \"Each company showed itself to be aiming to satisfy a known source of demand for copyright infringement, the market comprising former Napster users.\" Essentially that means the Betamax ruling's protections still will apply in most cases, lawyers said. However, the ruling does dispel the most expansive interpretation of that decision, under which any product with any legal use, no matter how minimal, was viewed as necessarily legal, said Thelen Reid & Priest attorney Michael Elkin. \"Idon't think the Sony Betamax decision ever gave a get-out-of-jail-free pass to anyone,\" Elkin said. Critics of the ruling said that the court provided no clear standard or test to define inducement, aside from noting several instances in which the peer-to-peer companies appeared to cross the line. Some in the technology world said the result could lead to more litigation against young companies with new technologies."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\"This is a very dangerous decision for technology and innovation,\" said Ed Black, chief executive officer of the Computer and Communications Industry Association. \"If you think of the Sony decision as a shield or an umbrella, we're afraid some holes have been punctured in that umbrella.\" Added Michael Petricone, vice president of technology policy for the Consumer Electronics Association: \"It is a real concern for the entire industry. We are faced with competitors in China and India who do not face the same litigation burden that companies will with this decision.\" Not everyone in Silicon Valley took a bleak view of the ruling, however. An Intel spokeswoman said the company was still studying the ruling, but noted that the court seemed to have upheld the most important aspects of the Betamax decision. Changed landscape for digital content? The decision isn't likely to eliminate file swapping. Many of the most popular services are decentralized enough that they can exist even if a parent company disappears. Many peer-to-peer services also are based outside the United States or have been created by overseas programmers. U.S. courts have shown their willingness to reach overseas companies in some cases, however. Already, a Los Angeles court has ruled that Kazaa parent Sharman Networks, based in Australia, maintains enough business connections in the United States to be sued in American courts . If the decision--and subsequent lower court actions--pushes file-swapping services further underground, it can only help companies such as Apple that are selling music and movies online, music service executives said. \"Ithink the Supreme Court did the right thing, in a lucid way,\" said Rob Glaser, CEO of RealNetworks. \"Ithink it will make a difference in the long slog to convert the industry over to legitimacy, by not allowing businesses to do this kind of nudge-nudge wink-wink marketing.\" Apple, Napster and other digital music services also hailed the ruling as a vindication of their business models. The decision could also be a boost for companies such as Shawn Fanning's Snocap or Audible Magic, which offer technology for filtering copyrighted files out of peer-to-peer swaps, or turning those swaps into transactions. Today that available filtering technology focuses only on music files, but tools are being developed to identify and block movie downloads . \"To the P2P operators, the LimeWires and the eDonkeys: We want to work with you,\" said Mitch Bainwol, chief executive officer of the Recording Industry Association of America. \"This is time to come forward and start filtering. We can build a better digital age together.\" Although the decision technically leaves the file-swapping companies' fate to the lower court, it could hold the seeds of a quick decision in favor of Hollywood and the record labels. Souter's ruling noted that the original trial judge granted summary judgment to Grokster, but said the lower court should instead immediately reconsider the copyright companies' request for summary judgment. Souter was supported unanimously in his decision by all nine justices, a rare level of agreement on controversial cases. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote one concurring decision that was joined by Justices Anthony Kennedy and William Rehnquist. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote a second concurrence, joined by Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O'Connor.

However, if an \n\ninsufficient number of workers have left by mid-2004, redundancies \n\ncould be implemented. Once the restructuring is complete, the firm \n\nshould have about 950 employees in Dublin, or about 25 fewer than \n\nit had in January 2002, when it promised to hire another 200 Irish \n\nworkers.

He said that small firms don't trust the \n\ntelecoms firms that are offering ADSL and added that the government\n\nhad done little to stimulate demand for the service. At the same \n\nevent, Communications Minister Dermot Ahern predicted the end of \n\nroaming charges in the island of Ireland early next year, branding \n\nsuch costs as a \"rip off.\" Ahern also said he would raise the \n\nissue with his Northern counterpart, Minister Ian Pearson.

FULL STORY FLEXTRONICS TO SHUT TULLAMORE PLANT Contract electronics maker Flextronics is shutting its Tullamore \n\nplant, with the loss of 80 jobs. The job cuts were blamed on the \n\nloss of contracts, as well as the relative high cost of \n\nmanufacturing in Ireland compared to lower-cost economies in Asia \n\nand elsewhere. The announcement came on the same day that storage \n\nsystem maker Adaptec announced the closure of its Dublin plant, \n\nciting similar reasons (see below). Last month, network equipment\n\nmaker 3Com announced the closure of its Blanchardstown plant, \n\nwith the loss of over 600 jobs, in favour of overseas \n\nmanufacturing. At its peak in Tullamore, Flextronics employed over \n\n400 people, but last year around 320 permanent jobs and 50 \n\ntemporary jobs were cut at the plant. Since 2001, Flextronics has \n\nalso slashed hundreds of jobs in Limerick and Cork.

The company said that\n\nabout 40 jobs at its facility in the Clonshaugh Industrial Estate \n\nin Dublin would go before the end of the year. Any remaining \n\nDublin-based staff working at the former Eurologic site will be \n\nmade redundant by March 2004, when the Dublin manufacturing \n\noperation will be shut down. In total, 75 jobs will be lost in Ireland \n\nas a result of the moves. It is understood that former Eurologic \n\nworkers in the company's overseas locations, most notably the US, \n\nwill be unaffected. Aspokesperson for Adaptec said the firm is \n\nmoving Eurologic's network storage operations from Dublin \n\nto Singapore.

What Can We Learn from NAFTA? by Julie Stanton, Ph.D. At the December 1994 Summit of the Americas, Chile was officially invited by the three NAFTA member countries to negotiate entry into the agreement. For many, this invitation has been seen as the first step in creating a western hemispheric free trade zone, a goal considered by observers to be crucial in maintaining U.S. competitiveness in world markets. However, the acceptance of Chile into negotiations has been met with considerable debate. The first aspect of this debate concerns the results of NAFTA as is, with three member countries. According to Congressional testimony (U.S. GPO, 1995), the debate among U.S. representatives is fierce. Proponents point to high levels of new trade between the two countries, increases in employment in the U.S., and the important role of NAFTA in cushioning what would have otherwise been disastrous effects of the Mexican peso devaluation. They therefore encourage the extension of NAFTA to other countries in the hemisphere, particularly Chile. Opponents decry results in particular sectors, and see the U.S. as having lost considerably in employment and trade. Thus they conclude that NAFTA, with Mexico, has been a failed experiment at free trade between countries of vastly different resources and economic levels and thus should not be compounded further with a new entry such as Chile. Indeed, there are a number of problem areas in horticultural trade between the NAFTA partners. Packaging standards that undermine bulk shipments; the imposition of plant inspection fees; minimum prices on fresh fruit; complicated storage protocols; a problematic transportation network; \"voluntary\" trade restraints; retaliatory use of phytosanitary restrictions; and questions of application of existing U.S. law all arose as general areas of dispute after NAFTA implementation. It is likely that similar issues will arise if Chile is formally included in a free trade agreement. Further, for commodities that had already been important to bilateral trade between the U.S. and Mexico, competition accelerated sharply despite longer phase-in periods for tariff liberalization. Tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers, squash and a number of other commodities have been the subject of heated disputes, including formal petitions in some cases, primarily because of decreasing U.S. market shares for domestic producers. Although declining market shares is not an unexpected result of free trade, the sentiment is that shares declined too rapidly for producers to gradually shift to other crops. While this demands that attention be paid to the scheduling of tariff liberalization in any free trade agreement with Chile, one must not forget the likely role of the peso devaluation in accelerating the decline of U.S. market shares. Of course, the question as to whether NAFTA's results implies lessons for the impending negotiations with Chile must consider two additional factors: first, there are many who consider NAFTA a success in creating jobs and exports for the U.S. and attribute many of the negative patterns to the peso devaluation, and second, only a few years have passed since NAFTA's implementation and many of the lasting benefits to the U.S. will be apparent only in the long-run. For those reasons, it will be difficult to adjust the negotiating strategy for Chile using lessons other than those concerning procedural issues and the length of liberalization periods for sensitive crops. Another aspect of the debate concerns the suitability of Chile as a partner. Indeed, many have agreed that Chile might have made a better candidate for NAFTA than Mexico, due to a longer, more stable history of democratization and privatization. Mexico's actions to remove substantial government presence in the markets has been only recent, while Chile has fostered the growth of private markets, including financial markets which are considered relatively strong. Chile is also already an important market for the U.S. 1994 trade resulted in $2.3 billion of Chilean exports to the U.S., while the U.S. contributed 23% of total Chilean imports. While Chile's population is only about one-sixth that of Mexico, U.S. exports to Chile in 1994 were actually more than all exports to India, a country of nearly 1 billion people. Also, average tariff rates show that the relative advantage to the U.S. is greater with free trade with Chile than it was with Mexico. Chilean tariffs average 11% on U.S. exports, and the U.S. only 1% on Chilean exports. Prior to NAFTA, the ratio was 10 to 4 for Mexican tariffs to U.S. Indeed, for particular fruits and vegetables, Chile has been quite a significant trade partner to the U.S. In recent years, Chile has supplied about two-thirds of all U.S. imports of avocados (Plunkett, 1997), and is the third-largest supplier of fresh asparagus (Calvin and Cook, 1997). The U.S. also imports about three-quarters of all strawberries that Chile exports (McNeil, 1993). The question for policymakers is whether these characteristics of Chile and its existing trade patterns with the U.S. would result in a different outcome under free trade than has NAFTA with Mexico. Clearly the crop mix of most trade importance is somewhat different.  Besides the avocados, asparagus and strawberries mentioned above, Chile is a significant producer of fresh table grapes and wine, products that are well-ensconced in Californian agriculture and therefore likely to draw long tariff liberalization periods. Interestingly, the case of wine illustrates a possible complication arising from inclusion of Chile in a free trade agreement that already includes Mexico. Chilean wines have been accorded preferential tariff treatment by Mexico, at rates below the tariff applied to U.S. wine exports. Even though NAFTA eliminates Mexican tariffs on U.S. wines completely over 10 years, those placed on Chilean wines are already lower and expected to be phased out sooner (Hayes, 1996). While the U.S. considers the impact of free bilateral trade with Chile, it should also recognize that Chile's entry into a revised NAFTA would not be bilateral, but instead imply reduced tariffs among all partners. That is, while the U.S. may have established better trading conditions with Mexico under NAFTA, the entry of Chile may in fact result in sufficient additional competition for the Mexican market as to reverse or diminish those gains. Further, it will be interesting to see whether the higher transportation costs that Chilean exports face in reaching the North American market play a significant role in becoming a stronger competitor for the U.S. market. These costs must be compared to the generally higher labor costs incurred by U.S. growers to determine relative competitiveness. Afinal aspect of the debate concerns hemispheric trade more generally. Proponents of Chile's entry into NAFTA argue that without this step, the U.S. will be left behind in the global trend toward free trade. Already, Chile's neighbors have joined in a customs union, and Chile is discussing its potential with them and with the European Union. Some point to the rapidly growing Latin American market as being much more important to the U.S. than is trade even with traditional partners in the European Union. Opponents point to the differences in economics among hemispheric countries as being unsuitable for full integration with the U.S. Lower labor costs, more lax environmental standards, and less advanced trading technology are often mentioned as factors complicating trade between countries of different developmental levels.

Market Watch......U.S. Onion Market by Pieter van Ispelen Export key to market under pressure Production of summer storage onions for the fresh market has been  increasing strongly in the 1990s.   Excluding the summer California crop (which goes mainly to the dehydrated market), production in 1996 was about 33 million cwt. compared to less than 26 million cwt. in 1989. The increase in production has been mainly contributed to increases: 1) in domestic consumption as southwestern-type foods become more popular; 2) better storage techniques which enables the summer storage onion producing states to ship far into the following calendar year; and 3) a favorable export market Exports reached an all time high in 1994, which caused the prices of the storage crop (harvested in and recorded back to 1993) to sky rocket.  The consequence was that in following years acreage was increased to make U.S. growers able to take advantage of the strong export market.  However, as the 1994 high in exports was mostly due to high demand from Japan (when the onion crop failed) the market since that time has seen more moderate foreign demand.  Therefore, the trend over the last few years has been that prices have been under pressure as the domestic market has had to absorb product that couldn't be shipped elsewhere.  The U.S. annual export volume comprises about 11% of total annual U.S. onion production. This volume can significantly influence domestic prices when export demand shows. Looking at this issue a little bit closer, projections of 1997 numbers can give a better insight in this effect.  Domestic per capita consumption is expected to flatten out at 17.5 pounds, while annual onion production is projected to reach 5,110 million pounds (USDA), a 3% overall decrease from last year.  However, this decrease is mainly due to declines in spring and summer non-storage onion production.  In particular, Texas has had problems this year with bad weather circumstances.  The summer storage production is expected to be around 3,550 million pounds, 7% higher than last year and 2%  more than in 1995.  Most of this increase is due to higher acreage in Washington and Western Oregon.  Geographically, these states are in the best position to profit from the export market which mainly targets the Pacific Rim countries.  These numbers show that Washington shippers have high hopes and plant onions anticipating good export demand.  Alight export demand year would force Washington shippers to look to the domestic market to take a larger percentage of their product. Assuming export levels will stay close to last year's level (580 million pounds annually) prices for summer storage onions are likely to stay under last year's level of $9.8 per cwt. as production increases while demand stays level.  The annual average U.S. grower price would end up around $9.85, at the same level as in 1994 and 1995 and thanks to high prices in the spring - 3% higher than last year's average annual price. While they are hoping for good export demand, some shippers are openly pessimistic about the long term prices this season.  Quantification of the exact effect of export demand on average grower prices could be of great interest to onion growers in planning their crops.  Preliminary analysis shows that, for each million pounds that export demand will differ from the expected 560 million pounds annually the average annual U.S. grower price either will go up (favorable export demand) or will go down (slacking export demand) by 15 cents per cwt. Caution should be taken with these numbers, as preliminary analysis is done on annual data while more thorough analysis will need to be done on a monthly and seasonal basis.

Legis lative Update... by Albert Kagan, Ph.D."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Fruit and vegetable growers watch with caution as \"fast track\" authorization is debated. As of this writing the Senate has passed the authorization and sent the legislation to the House. Many representatives of the produce industry feel that any expansion of trade legislation may not be in their best interest at this time. Much of the industry concern regarding fast track stems from a feeling that NAFTA has not benefited various sectors of the produce sector. Also there is a perception that many commitments made by the administration regarding NAFTA passage have not come to fruition. Fast track supporters argue that all commitments were honored, however the timing may be disputed. Underlying the fast track debate is the administration's objective to solidify trade agreements with Chile and other Latin American nations. The argument that hemispheric trade agreements are beneficial to all countries is in dispute. There is the continuing fear that markets will be lost to U Sindustries and a displacement of American workers will occur. It appears that trade negotiations with Chile will continue throughout the fall as the president prepares for an upcoming visit to Latin America. Chile has recently negotiated bilateral trade arraignments with NAFTA members  Canada and Mexico as well as joining MERCOSUR as an associate member. From a fruit and vegetable perspective trade related claims effecting fresh tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, avocados, and most recently apples leaves industry members watching the debate with keen interest."}]}

Everyday these corporations shirk more of the public interest, slash more of their news budgets, and fail to deliver information vital to the health of our communities and our democracy. The movement to challenge these giant corporations is much more than a media reform movement, it is a grassroots media production movement: a movement of  independent journalists, radio producers, filmmakers, and online community builders, a movement of storytellers constantly seeking better ways to make and distribute the stories the big corporations can’t or won’t produce for our communities. This is a movement for everyone that likes a good story, that wants to tell one or hear one, whether they’re a veteran media-maker or someone whose only just thought of picking up a camera or imagined seeing their story in print. This is a movement that believes the more we democratize the media by growing the pool of storytellers and distributing their stories, the better off our communities, and our democracy will be. On Saturday May 21st you’re invited to the Bellingham Grassroots and Independent Media Conference running 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Garden St. Family Center (1231 N. Garden) in Bellingham, WA. The conference website is www.whatcompjc.org/media conf.. This conference is a new project of  the Whatcom Peace & Justice Center. The conference is being held to celebrate the growing local and regional culture of media production, to build awareness of innovative community radio, video, and web-based media projects, and to mobilize support for grassroots powered media reform. We also seek to understand how the independent media movement can more effectively challenge the assumptions perpetuated in the mass media that justify war and social injustice. Keynote speaker Patrick Reinsborough, of the smartMeme project, will kick off the conference at 9 a.m. speaking on: “Winning the Battle of the Story: Creating a Culture of Change.” Patrick is dynamic a grassroots organizer, campaigner, and media strategist who spent four year as the organizing director of the Rainforest Action Network where he mobilized thousands of people to confront corporations who destroy the environment and violate human rights. The smartMeme project is a collective of organizers, trainers and media activists, who help grassroots groups magnify their impact by linking traditional movement building skills with cutting edge media campaigning. Keynote Speaker Bert Sacks will speak on “Sanctions, War, Occupation, and other Failures of the Media.” Bert Sacks has traveled to Iraq nine times since 1996 with Voices in the Wilderness and Washington Physicians for Social Responsibility, and has extensive experience lobbying the media for greater and more accurate coverage of the situation in Iraq and the Middle East. The conference will feature numerous workshops, skills trainings, and panel discussions by local media makers and media activists from throughout the region. These include a workshop by John Sinno of Arab Film Distribution on the demonizing and stereotyping of Arabs in the media and popular culture, panel discussions on the indymedia movement, community radio, documentary film & video, public access TV, online community media projects, reports from the National Conference on Media Reform, and more.

What the bills do: Restaurant owners are pursuing legislation in Olympia that would cut tipped employees minimum wage from $7.35 per hour to a base wage of $3.68 per hour. Instead of “protecting” or “enhancing” workers wages and benefits this legislation would basically cut all tipped employees minimum wages to $3.68 instead of the current state minimum wage of $7.35. Restaurant Employers would be required to make up the difference only if tips did not. So if a server was receiving the minimum wage whatever a server made between $7.35 and $11.03 every hour would go into the employers pocket. That’s is basically a wage cut of $3.68 per hour, nearly $30 in an 8 hr. day, and nearly $150 a week. That’s taking a living wage job and turning it into a poverty level job. Plus, how long would an employee who didn't make an average of $3.70 an hour in tips last before their boss fired them? Another thing about this legislation is that it only applies to new hires.

This headline no doubt produced a state of confusion in many who read it. In what sense does President Bush want to ‘save social security’? Perhaps only in the sense of that officer in Vietnam who said: “We had to destroy the village in order save it.” So why is the major media working so hard for Mr. Bush? It’s a good question, and maybe the question. Democrats have been doing a good job of holding their elected officials accountable, but it’s time to start working on the press. The battle to save social security has in many ways already been won in Washington, D.C. but if we do nothing it may be lost in newsrooms around the country. Here’s another key question: When the President tells a lie is it the duty of the press to repeat the lie verbatim? Or is it the duty of the press to call the President out for lying? When we fail to answer this question correctly we go to war on false pretenses, gut key social programs, and bankrupt the nation. In 1946 George Orwell published his famous essay “Politics and the English Language” in which he wrote: “Aman may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure, and then fail all the more completely because he drinks. It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language. It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.” The times being what they are we cannot afford foolish thoughts or a slovenly media which fails to hold the powerful accountable to the truth. Diverting money from the social security trust fund into private accounts will not save and strengthen social security, it will only weaken and defund it. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research nearly 2/3rds of elderly households get more than half their income from social security and nearly half of the elderly would fall below the poverty line without it. Additionally, more than 6 million workers receive disability benefits through the Social Security trust fund, as do 1.6 million children. These people have been effectively disappeared from the national debate. As Senator Patty Murray states: “While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on senior citizens, our priority in this discussion should be ensuring that we're doing right by those who rely on Social Security – from current workers to retirees, the disabled and widows.” To help save Social Security please visit www.thereisnocrisis.com"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "// posted by Nate Johnson @ 2:34 PM 0 comments"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Thursday, February 03, 2005"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Senator Murray Vows to Fight to Preserve Social Security"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Senator Murray Vows to Fight to Preserve Social Security For Immediate Release: Thursday, February 3, 2005 http://murray.senate.gov/news.cfm?id=231476 From the desk Senator Patty Murray:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Afew short years after the 1932 stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression, one of our nation's greatest leaders – Franklin Delano Roosevelt – set out to create a program to provide peace of mind and a sense of security to America's retirees. During his crusade to create the program, FDR said, \"There is no tragedy in growing old, but there is tragedy in growing old without means of support.\" The program he created is to this day the single greatest social insurance program in our nation's history. Social Security, as it would be called, has been a resounding success by keeping millions of people out of poverty. Just months before the new program was enacted, FDR laid out his vision of how this most important program should be implemented. He said: \"We can never insure one-hundred percent of the population against one-hundred percent of the hazards and vicissitudes of life. But we have tried to frame a law which will give some measure of protection to the average citizen and to his family against the loss of a job and against poverty-ridden old age. This law, too, represents a cornerstone in a structure which is being built, but is by no means complete.... It is...a law that will take care of human needs and at the same time provide for the United States an economic structure of vastly greater soundness.\" Those were the words of FDR in August, 1935 But today, this cornerstone, this basic American value, is now under attack. President Bush is currently traveling the country saying Social Security is in crisis and that it needs to be radically restructured. But Irise today to reaffirm the values and spirit FDR laid out 70 years ago. Social Security has pulled seniors from poverty and put millions of retiring minds at ease. America's insurance program is a guaranteed benefit that all Americans can count on. It's a promise that if you work hard, you'll have some security when you retire or if you become disabled. It's a promise that seniors won't have to live in poverty. And it's a promise that if your spouse passes on, you will continue to have the support and security you need. And of course the program is about more than security -- it's about community. In America, we believe that it's important to take care of the generation that came before. It's important to guarantee them a quality of life. And it's important that we guarantee benefits after a lifetime of hard work. But I'm very concerned that President Bush's \"restructuring\" will imperil the security of all Americans – from young workers retiring in decades to seniors retiring today. The problem with his plan is that: * It's the end of guaranteed benefits. * It does nothing to fix the long-term issues the system faces. * It adds trillions of dollars to our national debt. * It's dangerous. We cannot, and will not, let President Bush tear apart Social Security. While some are trying to enrich Wall Street or push an ideology or force market experiments on senior citizens, our priority in this discussion should be ensuring that we're doing right by those who rely on Social Security – from current workers to retirees, the disabled and widows. Current and future retirees need someone to stand up for them, and if Isee something that's going to hurt our workers, our families, and our seniors, I'm going to fight it with everything I've got. Any discussion about Social Security must meet certain criteria if it means to be productive. You could call it a test – and any proposal we discuss must pass this test if it wants to move from this body. We must: * Preserve Social Security's guaranteed benefit * Preserve Social Security's protections for workers when they are disabled * Protect against benefit reductions for women, minorities and all others * Protect our budget from ever growing deficits Anything short of this would be an unnecessary, dangerous gamble unworthy of this important insurance program. While we’re just beginning this discussion, my female colleagues and Ihave worked for years to ensure some basic principles are followed as we move forward. The promise of Social Security is especially important to women because women face unique challenges in retirement. We know that women make less money than men, women leave the workforce to raise families, women live longer, and women are more likely to suffer from a chronic health condition. Even with those special challenges, Social Security keeps millions of older women out of poverty. Its benefit formulas are tilted to give a greater rate of return for lower wage workers like women and minorities. If the President privatizes Social Security, he would destroy the guaranteed benefit that low-wage earners need in their retirement years. We also know that Social Security isn't just a retirement program. As I've said, it protects disabled workers and their families. If Social Security is privatized, what happens to a worker who is disabled and can't contribute to her account? Today, under Social Security, that worker is protected. But there's no guarantee under the Bush plan. President Bush could undo the progressive structure that older women depend on. This is one reform that would have disastrous results, and Iknow we will not stand for it. Under this Administration, many things we take for granted from overtime pay to community police to safe drinking water have been threatened. Now President Bush wants to dismantle Social Security. Iam here today to say that some things are just too important to American families. Providing real security to all Americans is a basic value worth protecting. We will make sure that President Bush doesn't gamble that security and break the promise Social Security keeps for millions of women and their families."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "// posted by Nate Johnson @ 2:34 PM 1 comments"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Senator Murray takes the plunge"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "U.S. SEN.

This sort of mumbojumbo might have some logic from a Republican up for reelection next year who's trying to be as cautious as possible. But why would any Democrat -- like the recently-reelected senator from the Northwest whose office the reader contacted -- be saying something so foolish? The White House has its own reasons for pretending they haven't decided on a specific plan yet. But why do the president's opponents have to pretend that that's really true? Everybody in the country who's paying any attention to this debate knows the essence of the president's plan -- he wants to replace a portion of Social Security with private investment accounts. How he fudges the numbers on the cost side or deals with benefit cuts remains a bit muddled. But the fundamental point is as clear as day. So why should any senator or representative be waiting one minute to make their position clear, unless he or she is seriously entertaining the idea of voting for the president's plan? How many details of an upper-income-earner tax hike do most Republicans need to see before they're willing to say they oppose it? Yeah, that's my sense too. To be cagey like this is not only a disservice, even a dishonesty , to constituents, it's also the height of foolishness for any lawmaker who really cares about preserving Social Security and not letting the president end the program."}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "-- Josh Marshall Here's the e-mail Isent him:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Hi, Thanks for your great coverage of Social Security, to me (someone who cares alot about what's been going on in Iraq) this is a way, way bigger deal.

Introduction"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "GaN is a strongly bonded compound well suited for applications such as high\npower, high temperature electronics. The bonding energy of GaN is 8.9 eV/atom\nwhereas for GaAs it is only 6.5 eV/atom [1] . Consequently, the free energy G(T)\nof the crystal is very low in relation to the reference state of free Nand Ga\natoms.\n\tOn the other hand, the N 2 molecule is also strongly bonded\n(4.9eV/atom). Therefore, the free energy of the constituent Ga and\nN 2 becomes quite close and surpasses that of GaN as the temperature\nis raised. Figure 1 shows the free energy of GaN (1 mole) versus its\nconstituents (Ga + 1/2N 2 ) as a function of temperature. The G(T) of the constituents decreases faster than that of the GaN crystal and\nat higher temperatures GaN become thermodynamically unstable.\n\tThe crossing of G(T) curves determines the equilibrium temperature where GaN\ncoexists with its constituents at a given N 2 pressure.\n\tThe application of pressure allows  us to increase the free energy of the\nconstituents much more than that of the crystal shifting the equilibrium point\nto higher temperature and extending the stability range of GaN.\n\tThe equilibrium p N2 - Tconditions for GaN determined\nexperimentally by Karpinski et al. [2] [3] are shown in Figure 2 . Most of crystallization processes discussed in this paper have been\ncarried-out in large volume gas pressure reactors at an N 2 overpressure of up to 15 kbar, which corresponds to a GaN stability limit at\n1850K.\n\tThe maximum temperature of 1850 Kis quite far from the melting temperature of\nGaN. According to the theoretical estimation of Van Vechten [4] the melting\npoint of GaN is ~3000K. The N 2 equilibrium pressure at the melting\npoint is therefore much higher than we can obtain in our experimental system.\n\tThe extension of the GaN stability range to 1850 Kallows the growth of GaN\ncrystals from a liquid Ga solution. In Figure 3 we show the Nsolubility data\nresulting from the annealing of Ga at the three phase equilibrium conditions of Figure 2 . Since the Nconcentrations are not high, the growth experiments have to be long\nto obtain high quality bulk GaN crystals with dimensions appropriate for\nmeasurements and applications. Therefore, stability over a long time (>100h)\nis an additional requirement for the growth system.\n\tThe solid line in Figure 3 is the liquidus line for Ga-GaN system calculated\nusing an ideal solution approximation and Van Vechten's melting\ntemperature of 2790K.

Moreover, crystallization from a dilute\nsolution requires lengthy processes of ~100 hours.

Crystallization without intentional seeding"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Gallium, when heated under high N 2 pressure, does not wet the\ncrucible walls (usually graphite or BN). Rather, it is covered with a thin GaN\nlayer consisting of GaN single crystals. This is the first step of GaN\ncrystallization at high N 2 pressure. The size of the crystals\ncovering the Ga depends on the sequence and rates of compression and heating of\nthe system. Atypical structure of the surface layer is shown in Figure 5 . The formation of the surface layer inhibits further synthesis of the nitride\nwhich allows longtime crystallization processes and the growth of relatively\nlarge GaN crystals. Since the solution is in a temperature gradient, the GaN\nlayer at the hot end of the crucible dissolves in gallium and is transported,\nby convection and diffusion, to the cooler zone of the crucible where the\nsolution become supersaturated and crystallization of GaN takes place. The\ncrystals of the surface layer are the natural source of growth centers for\nfurther crystallization. Some of them start to grow faster hindering the growth\nof the neighboring ones. This selection leads to the formation of relatively\nlarge, well shaped GaN crystals on the internal surface of the surface layer. The GaN crystals grown by this method are wurzite, mainly in the form of\nhexagonal platelets or hexagonal needles, depending on the growth conditions. Ageneral tendency is that high supersaturation favors growth in the c-direction\nwhich produces the needle-like crystals. Supersaturation of the growth solution\nis determined mainly by the growth temperature, supercooling, mass transport\nmechanisms in Ga, and also the local surroundings for a particular crystal. Crystals in the form of hexagonal platelets grow slowly, with a rate <0.1\nmm/h into the {10 0} directions (perpendicular to the c-axis). They are\nusually single crystals having perfect morphology suggesting stable layer-by\nlayer growth. They are transparent, colorless, with flat faces. In some cases,\nthree dimensional, hexagonal growth which occurs during the post-growth system\ncooling is observed on the crystal surfaces. Some GaN platelets grown without\nintentional seeding are shown in Figure 6 . For crystallization of large GaN crystals by this method, it is crucial to\ncontrol the supersaturation to avoid acceleration of the growth near the edges\nand corners of the growing crystal. This can occur if some of them reach\ndimensions significantly larger than the others. Then the edge nucleation on\nthe hexagonal faces of the GaN platelets is often observed. This is the first\nstep to unstable growth on these faces. The result of such a growth is shown in Figure 7a . In extreme cases of very high supersaturation or when the\nsupersaturation is abruptly increased (i.e. by increasing the temperature\ngradient), the growth into c-direction, nucleated at the edges of the platelet,\nbecome very fast and leads to the formation of well developed {10 0}\nfaces. This results in a hollow needle-like crystal such as is shown in Figure\n7b. Therefore, for growing of large GaN platelets of stable morphology, the\nsupersaturation must be decreased during the crystallization process inorder to\nprevent the runaway phenomena just described. Therefore for the stable growth of large GaN crystals it is necessary to have\nsufficiently low and uniform supersaturation across the growing crystal faces.\nOne of the most important factors influencing the uniformity of N-concentration\nin the growth zone is the volume of the solution in relation to the size of the\ngrowing crystal. In Figure 8 we show a crystal grown in a crucible with an\ninternal diameter of 17 mm (as opposed to 14 mm previously). The increase in\nthe crucible volume resulted in a significant increase of the size of crystals\nwhich could be grown with stable morphology. We summarize the general tendencies of GaN crystal growth without an\nintentional seeding following from the experimental results:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "The growth of GaN crystals from a diluted solution in liquid gallium is\nstrongly anisotropic. At lower supersaturations, the fastest growth directions are the [1 0 0 ] ones, perpendicular to the c-axis of the crystal. The growth rate\nin the [ 0 0 0 1 ] directions, parallel to the c-axis is then extremely slow.\nThis results in thin hexagonal platelets. With increasing supersaturation, the rate of the growth parallel to the\nc-axis abruptly increases, resulting in needle like crystals with well\ndeveloped {10 0} faces. We have estimated the supersaturation at which high quality GaN platelet grow\nat a rate of 0.1 mm/h. in the [1 0 0] direction (see Figure 9 ). For\nthe estimation, we assumed two dimensional layer-by-layer growth on the\n{10 0} face of the platelet with a thickness of 0.1 mm and length of\nthe leading edge of 1 mm. We also assumed that the creation of a 2-Dcritical\nnucleus on the crystal face results in the growth of a new layer. That is, the\nlateral growth rate is fast enough to complete the plane before appearance of\nthe next nucleus of the critical size. Aheat of GaN dissolution in liquid Ga\nof 0.49eV/bond (see Introduction) was used as a measure of bond energy in the\ncrystal in relation to the liquid phase."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "For a crystal growing at 1800K, we have obtained a supersaturation of the order\nof 50%. For the growth of GaN on a seed crystal with well developed\n{10 0} faces, the supersaturation necessary for stable two dimensional\ngrowth can be significantly lower due to large surface area of the fast growing\nplanes. The details of this estimation will be published elsewhere [5] ."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "2.3.

In Figure 10 , we show\nthe seed crystal which was introduced into the cooler zone of the vertical\ncrucible. It had well developed {10 0} prismatic faces and also\n{10 1} pyramidal ones. Ahexagonal surface did not appear due to the\nfast growth of the needle in c-direction."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Prior to the growth, it was necessary to heat the system up to\n1200 o Cat low N 2 pressure to achieve wetting of the seed\nwith liquid Ga. If the sysyem were be heated at high pressure, the\npolycrystalline surface layer would cover the Ga surface adjacent to the seed,\nand eliminate its usefulness for further crystallization. The growth on the seed was performed under conditions where high quality\nplatelets were obtained in previously described processes without intentional\nseeding. The resulting crystal, after 50 hours of growth, is shown in Figure\n11 . The fast growth directions were the [1 0 0], as\nexpected, and also the [1 0 1] one perpendicular to\nthe pyramidal face. Since the growth rate in the c-direction was very small, a\nhexagonal face developed in the resulting crystal. As we know from previous considerations, at low supersaturations, the growth\nrate in c-direction is almost zero whereas at higher supersaturations we fall\ninto the \"difficult\" region of the abrupt increase of the nucleation rate.\nTherefore, the growth on the hexagonal face is difficult to control and\nprobably is very sensitive to fluctuations of temperature, convectional flows\nand uniformity of the nitrogen concentration field in the crystal surrounding.\nThis can easily lead to three dimensional nucleation or to edge instabilities\nof the growth."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "3. Physical Properties of GaN crystals"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The quality of the GaN crystals was estimated by X-ray rocking\ncurves [6] . The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the X-ray\nrocking curves ((0004) CuK reflection) depends on the size of the crystal. The\nvalue is 20-30 arcsec for 1mm crystals and 30-40 arcsec for 1-3 mm ones. For\nlarger platelets the rocking curves split into a few 30-40 arcsec peaks showing\nthe presence of low angle (1-3 arcmin) boundaries separating grains of 0.5-2 mm\nin size. Misorientation between grains increases monotonically from end to end\nof the crystal [7] . This indicates a \"bending\" of the crystal during growth,\nfollowed by strain relaxation leading to the formation of the low angle\nboundaries. Indeed, the lattice constantsmeasured for the two basal planes of\nthe crystals differ by 0.001 » , suggesting different growth mechanisms and\ndefect structures for the two polar directions of the GaN platelet. It was\nshown by Liliental-Weber et al. [8] by TEM examination and confirmed by AFM\nstudies [9] , that one of the polar surfaces of the GaN crystals (especially for\nthe smaller ones) is often atomically flat (2-3 monolayer steps present) and\nthe crystal below is practically free of extended defects. However a high\nconcentration of point defects, mainly N-vacancies and Ga-antisites, were\ndeduced from Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction patterns [8] . On the opposite\nside, regular pyramids of 100 - 200 » in size terminate the surface [8] [9] .\nBelow are many extended defects such as stacking faults, dislocation loops and\nGa micro-precipitates. Such pecularities result from the different growth modes\nof the two polar directions of the crystal in the Ga-rich conditions of the\nprocess. For larger (>3 mm) GaN plateletes, the presence of three dimensional\nhexagonal features on the surfaces is typical. This results from the system\ncooling after the growth in the temperature gradient. The GaN crystals are highly conductive, showing metallic behavior in the whole\ntemperature range of 4.2-300K. Free electron concentration of 10 19 -\n10 20 cm -3 with mobilities of 30-90 cm 2 /Vs [10] are present regardless of temperature. No clear dependence of the electrical\nproperties on the growth conditions has been observed. Both ab initio calculations of electronic structure of GaN native defects [11] [12] and\nexperiments [13] confirm that the source of free electrons in this GaN is\nN-vacancies. The optical absorption spectra of pressure-grown GaN crystals and epitaxial\nGaN layers with a free electron concentration of 6x10 17 cm -3 have been measured by Teisseyre et al. [14] . Ashift to high\nenergy of the optical absorption edge for the bulk sample is observed and\nassigned to the Burstein-Moss effect [14] . Due to this shift, the bulk GaN\nsubstrate crystals are transparent to near edge luminescence of GaN. The dominant luminescence features of GaN bulk crystals are near band edge\nemission at ~3.5 eV and a broad yellow luminescence band centered around 2.3\neV."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "4. GaN homoepitaxy"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The first results of homoepitaxial growth of GaN MOCVD layers have been\nrecently reported [15] . Pressure grown GaN crystals were used as substrates.\nThe layers were grown in a horizontal atmospheric pressure Epigress system\nadapted to the growth of nitrides. TMG and NH 3 were used as sources\nof Ga and N, and H 2 was the carrier gas. The substrates did not\nrequire any mechanical or chemical surface treatment before the growth. Also\nthe deposition of a low temperature buffer layer was omitted. The growth\ntemperature was 900 - 1050°C. P-doping was realized using the\nMCp 2 Mg metalorganic and subsequent annealing of the layer at\n700°Cin the presence of N 2 gas. Si was introduced to\nachieve n-doping of the layers. Atomic Force Microscopy studies performed on homoepitaxially grown GaN layers\nindicate the presence of monatomic steps on the layer surfaces, often in the\nform of large diameter (100 m) spirals indicating two dimensional growth on\nscrew dislocations. The X-ray diffraction peaks from the homoepitaxial layer and from GaN\nsubstrate from [7] are shown in Figure 12 . The lattice constant parallel to the\ninterface is the same for both the substrate and homolayer, whereas the c\nconstant of the epilayer is smaller by about 0.02%. The increase of the c\nlattice constant of the bulk GaN crystals is related to the presence of the\nsame point defects responsible for the high concentration of free electrons. The high quality of the homoepitaxial layers is confirmed by the\nphotoluminescence measurements [15] . The spectrum is dominated by two strong\nand narrow lines XD (3.4719 eV) and XA (3.4666 eV) related to the excitons\nbound to neutral impurity centers [15] . The FWHM of these lines is about1.8 meV\nand 1.0 meV respectively. The higher energy XD line shows a double peak\nstructure which fitted with Lorenzian curves can be described by energies:\nE 1 = 3.4711 eV, E 2 = 3.4720 eV. The photoluminescence and\nreflectivity of GaN homoepitaxial layers are analyzed in detail in [15] . Also\nthe lifetime of the bound excitons has been measured [16] to be 650 and 700 ps\nfor excitons bound to the neutral donor and acceptor, respectively. This is\nmuch higher than the corresponding values for GaN/sapphire (70 and 140 ps,\nrespectively). The PL spectra for p-type Mg doped GaN homoepitaxial layers have been reported [17] . In addition to the XD and XA exciton lines (XA line much stronger than\nfor undoped layers), a series of very narrow lines attributed to donor-acceptor\npair related transitions have been observed between 3.4 - 3.5 eV. The FWHM of\nthese lines were < 0.5 meV. The PL lines observed for MOCVD grown\nhomoepitaxial layers are the narrowest so far reported for GaN. Recently very high quality homoepitaxial layer have been obtained by MBE [18] .\nThe nearedge photoluminescence spectrum of this layer is dominated by XD and XA\npeaks and 3 lines corresponding to free excitons. The PL lines for this layer\nare even sharper than for best MOCVD samples. The halfwidth of the XA line is\nsmaller than 0.5 meV"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "5.

For the non-lawyers, if you want to read on, the whole point of the following is that no government department is an entity capable of suing or being sued.  If you want to sue a Queensland government department, then you sue \"The State of Queensland\" or you sue the chief executive of that department - usually, it's the first. Lushlife referred me to the Dr Death inquiry transcripts which included this amusing little exchange on Day 1 between Tony Morris (the Commissioner - there's a photo of him down the bottom of the page here ) and David Boddice (for \"Queensland Health\" - you'll why I've put that in inverted commas if you read on), both of whom are Senior Counsel, though Tony at #34 is more highly ranked than David at #72.  I've highlighted in bold the parts that particularly amused me: COMMISSIONER: Thank you, Mr Boddice, for those very helpful submissions. Ipersonally have no difficulty with the proposition which you advance as to why Queensland Health has an interest in this matter or the criteria which should be taken into account in granting or refusing leave. My difficulty at the moment is in understanding precisely who or what it is that you will be representing. Itake it from what you have said so far that you are not proposing to represent all of the staff of Queensland Health? MR BODDICE: Yes, except to the extent of it causes a conflict or they seek separate representation. COMMISSIONER: Then how do we know which of the staff you are representing and which you are not? MR BODDICE: Because, as Iunderstand the system that applies, staff who seek representation make application to the Attorney's Department, a division of it, and a decision is made as to whether to grant indemnity or not. If they are granted indemnity, Irepresent those people. If it is of concern to the Commission Ican indicate at each time whether Irepresented that person or not. COMMISSIONER: Ithink the difficulty arises at an earlier stage, though, whether - counsel, consisting of investigative staff, going out and interviewing people, how do we know in advance whether it is a client of yours or not? For example, our first witness today is going to be Ms Hoffman. At the stage when we were interviewing Ms Hoffman, how were we to know whether you were going to be appearing for her or not? Iassume you are not, by the way? MR BODDICE: Not that Iam aware, no. Idon't understand she has sought leave - Idon't understand she has sought representation. COMMISSIONER: You will see the difficulty, don't you? Who do your instructions come from? Is it the Director-General? MR BODDICE: They come from the Director-General, and Isuppose ultimately----- COMMISSIONER: Or the Minister? MR BODDICE: And the Minister as well. COMMISSIONER: Well, isn't there a potential conflict there? Isn't it a situation where ultimately this inquiry will have to determine if there are problems within the department, whether it is a situation where the Minister was informed of the problem and did nothing about them, or whether it is a situation where the department withheld relevant information from the Minister? MR BODDICE: No, because in my submission Iam there representing the department, and as has been stated in public and Istate publicly now, Queensland Health intends to cooperate fully, and all documents that have been asked forhave been provided and will be continued to be provided. COMMISSIONER: We will come back to that in a moment. Do you have instructions to represent the Minister? MR BODDICE: Iexpect that Iwill do. COMMISSIONER: Ican't give leave on the basis of your expectation. Will you get those instructions and inform the inquiry whether you are representing the Minister? Do you represent the Director-General. MR BODDICE: At the moment Iseek leave to represent Queensland Health. COMMISSIONER: Iam not going to give leave on that basis. Do you have instructions to represent the Director-General? MR BODDICE: Iexpect when the Director-General is called to give evidence, Iwill have instructions to represent him while he is giving evidence. COMMISSIONER: Only while he is giving evidence, not in cross-examining other witnesses? MR BODDICE: Iexpect, as is consistent with my instructions, Iam here to represent Queensland Health, which is the entity. COMMISSIONER: It is not an entity, that's the problem. Queensland Health is a branch of the Government of Queensland. To say you are representing Queensland Health is like saying you are representing the Stones Corner Branch of the Commonwealth Bank. It is not a separate and distinct entity, it is part of the Crown right of the State of Queensland. MR BODDICE: Iunderstand that, but it is the organisation responsible for the running of the hospitals and it is that organisation Iam seeking leave to represent. COMMISSIONER: And that's where Ihave difficulty in understanding where you draw the line. If you speak about it as an organisation, that presumably means all of its staff, and you will be protecting the interests of all of its staff. If it is something less than that, Iwould like to know what it is, whether it is only the Director-General, whether it is the Director-General and its deputies. You refer to the Fitzgerald Inquiry. My recollection was Mr Callanan was given leave to appear for the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners of the Queensland Police Service, or natural persons, rather than the Police Service as an entity. That may be mistaken. MR BODDICE: That's not correct, with respect. In fact, they were separately represented by other counsel, as were, of course, the union----- COMMISSIONER: Yes. MR BODDICE: -----separately represented by other counsel. COMMISSIONER: In this case we have got - as Iunderstand, the Queensland Nurses' Union will be seeking leave to appear. They obviously will represent a great number of people who are members of the staff of the department that you are purporting to speak for, the AMA Queensland will be seeking leave to appear. They obviously represent quite a number of the people that you are purporting to speak for. Ijust can't see practically how you can say, \"Iappear for the department\", without identifying in what sense you appear for the department. MR BODDICE: That must be the difficulty that confronted the Fitzgerald Inquiry. COMMISSIONER: Well, perhaps the decision was wrong or perhaps the circumstances were so different that it didn't matter, but in this case, given the structure of Queensland Health, the zones and regions, and so on, before giving leave Iwould like to know quite specifically whose interests you are representing. If it were, for example, the council or the committee operating Bundaberg Hospital, they might have quite different views about the matters arising here from the Director-General or other staff in Charlotte Street. MR BODDICE: Yes. COMMISSIONER: Again, Ican't see how you can possibly get around the conflict of interest that arises from representing on the one hand the interests of the bureaucrats in Charlotte Street, and on the other hand representing the interests of people who are operating the hospital on the ground in Bundaberg. MR BODDICE: That, with respect, assumes there is a conflict in those interests. COMMISSIONER: Ithought you just agreed that there was. Those parties would have quite different views as to the likely outcome of the appropriate recommendations and findings of this inquiry. MR BODDICE: Idon't think that necessarily follows at all, with respect. COMMISSIONER: Well, do you have instructions? Have you spoken to the people from Bundaberg? Do you know what they are hoping to get out of this inquiry? MR BODDICE: Ihave instructions to act for Queensland Health. COMMISSIONER: Who gave you those instructions? MR BODDICE: Pardon? COMMISSIONER: Who gave you those instructions? MR BODDICE: Those instructions came, Iam instructed, through the Crown Solicitor. COMMISSIONER: Yes, and who gave the Crown Solicitor his instructions? MR BODDICE: Iexpect it would have been the Director-General. COMMISSIONER: Well, Iam inclined at the moment to give you leave to represent the Director-General, if you wish to have such leave. MR BODDICE: Well, they aren't my instructions at the moment. COMMISSIONER: Iwill adjourn your application until you have got instructions identifying quite specifically who it is that's going to be represented here. Not just some nebulous, amorphous body that's referred to as Queensland Health, but some quite specific description of who it is who is going to be actually represented, who is going to be the source of your instructions, and whose viewpoint is going to be expressed to this inquiry through you and your learned juniors speaking on behalf of those who give you those instructions. MR BODDICE: Iwill get those instructions. COMMISSIONER: Thank you, Mr Boddice. Also for the lawyers, this calculator which shows you just how much time you have to put into the office to meet your billable hours requirement in private practice.  Note:  Idon't think that any lawyer can get away without at least 1 hour private time, 1 hour professional time and 1 hour administration time.

George W. Bush and his advisers' stated aim is to ensure that America and American interests dominate the entire world for the foreseeable future. And what's more they make no bones of the fact that they intend to achieve this without diplomacy - that's old hat. What PNAC intend to do is enforce the Pax Americana through military might. Does Tony Blair know that? Has Tony Blair read the PNAC Report called \"Rebuilding Americas Defenses 2000\"? It refers to the new technologies of warfare and goes  on: \"Potential rivals such as China are anxious to exploit these transformational technologies broadly, while adversaries like Iran, Iraq and North Korea are rushing to develop ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons as a deterrent to American intervention in regions they seek to dominate.\" So when George Bush and his colleagues talk about Saddam Hussein posing a \"threat\" to America - they don't mean he's going to drop bombs on Washington (how on earth could he without committing national suicide?) - what they mean is that he poses a threat to American military dominance in the Middle East. Does Tony Blair know that's what they mean? In fact, does Tony Blair know that President Bush's advisers regard Saddam Hussein as merely an excuse for military action in the area? The PNAC Report of 2000 states: \"the United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein.\" So Iraq is merely \"the immediate justification\" and Saddam's regime is not so important as establishing American military might in the Gulf. Does Tony Blair know that? If he has read PNAC's Report he knows that he is simply aiding US right-wing militarism and extremist Republican plans for world domination. Surely in such a cause he would not be prepared to expose the British people to the nightmare of permanent terrorist threats and attacks. Surely for such a cause he would not be prepared to set fire to the Middle East, to destabilize the entire world for the foreseeable future and - most important perhaps - to risk his own political neck by pursuing an evil and almost universally despised policy. On the other hand, if Tony Blair, has not read \"Rebuilding Americas Defenses 2000\" or gone to the PNAC website to learn exactly what motivates Rumsfeld, Cheney, Perle and Wolfowitz, and so on then why the hell hasn't he?

Subsequent to reporting my findings, Iwas ordered to MSFC to present a preliminary report prior to formal FRR meetings. Iparticipated in the formal FRR's for flight 51E which was scheduled for an April launch. The presentations were given at MSFC in February at three successively higher level review boards with exclusions and refinements in content made at each board level. Ispoke about my belief that the low ambient temperature prior to launch was responsible for such a large witness of hot gas (approximately 5500 °F [3040 °C]) blow-by but NASA Program Management insisted on that position being softened for higher and final review board presentations. The ambient temperature was 18 to 22 °F (-8 to -6 °C) several days prior to launch and in the 60 - 65 °F (16 to 18 °C) range at launch time and resulted in a seal temperature of 53 °F ( 12 °C) -which was calculated after the damage was found.

The preliminary resiliency testing, which was requested by Arnie Thompson, was performed in March and showed that a low temperature of 50 °F (10 °C) was a problem, as the seal material could not follow the rate of gap opening and lost contact with its mating surface. The significance of this data was that the seal erosion and blow-by problem was known to occur within 0.60 seconds during the motor ignition transient. The data was discussed with MTI Engineering Management, but was thought to be too sensitive by them to release to anyone.

The secondary seal in the same joint was eroded to a depth of 0.032 inches (0.81 mm) but sealed as expected. It was postulated from the evidence that the primary seal had not sealed during the full two minutes of booster flight. My former concerns about seal erosion and blow-by now escalated because if the same scenario should occur in a field joint, the secondary seal could also be compromised because it was a bore seal instead of the very safe face seal in the nozzle joint. This heightened concern was especially true for a low temperature launch because of the preliminary test results on seal resiliency at 50 °F (10 °C). An FRR was held at MSFC on July 1, 1985 for flight 51F which was scheduled for launch on July 29, 1985, with an additional presentation given on July 2nd which covered the overall problem status with all the booster seals. The preliminary test results on O-ring resiliency that were obtained in March and kept secret were presented to NASA for the first time at this meeting. The preliminary test configuration placed an O-ring seal into a flight size groove in a flat plate and compressed the seal 0.040 inches (1.02 mm) with another flat plate. After temperature conditioning of the assembly, the plates were separated 0.030 inches (0.76 mm) at a 2.0 inch (5.08 cm) per minute rate to simulate a flight rate of approximately 3.2 inches (8.13 cm) per minute (slightly unconservative). The test results showed no loss of seal contact at 100 °F (38 °C); loss of seal contact for 2.4 seconds at 75 °F (24 °C) and loss of seal contact for in excess of 10 minutes at 50 °F (10 °C). The testing also showed that a larger diameter seal (0.295 in - 7.49 mm) lost contact for 2 to 3 seconds at 50 °F (10 °C). This showed that the larger diameter seal performed at 50 °F (10 °C) similar to the operational flight seal (0.280 in - 7.11 mm) at 75 °F (24 °C), which was why the larger seal was being considered for a short-term fix. Everyone on the program, working with the joint seal problems, was now aware of the influence of low temperature on the field joint seals. Again, my concern about the joints increased due to the lack of attention being given to this problem by MTI. My notebook entry on August 15,1985 reads as follows: \"An attempt to form the team (Iwas referring to the SIRM Seal Erosion Task Team) was made on 19 July 1985. This attempt virtually failed and resulted in my writing memo 2870:FY86:073. This memo finally got some response and a team was formed officially. The first meeting was held on August 15, 1985 at 2:30 p.m.\" The memo Ireferred to is the one Iwrote to the Vice President of Engineering at MTI on July 31, 1985. The memo was stamped COMPANY PRIVATE by my boss and had a very limited distribution until Iread it to the Presidential Commission on February 25, 1986. The memo reads as follows: \"Subject: SRM O-Ring Erosion/Potential Failure Criticality. This letter is written to insure that management is fully aware of the seriousness of the current O-ring erosion problem in the SRM joints from an engineering standpoint. The mistakenly accepted position on the joint problem was to fly without fear of failure and to run a series of design evaluations which would ultimately lead to a solution or at least a significant reduction of the erosion problem. This position is now drastically changed as a result of the SRM 16A nozzle joint erosion which eroded a secondary O-ring with the primary O-ring never sealing.\" \"If the same scenario should occur in a field joint (and it could), then it is a jump ball as to the success or failure of the joint because the secondary O-ring cannot respond to the clevis opening rate and may not be capable of pressurization. The result would be a catastrophe of the highest order--loss of human life.\" \"An unofficial team (a memo defining the team and its purpose was never published) with leader was formed on 19 July 1985 and was tasked with solving the problem for both the short and long term. This unofficial team is essentially nonexistent at this time. In my opinion, the team must be officially given the responsibility and the authority to execute the work that needs to be done on a noninterference basis (full-time assignment until completed).\" \"It is my honest and very real fear that if we do not take immediate action to dedicate a team to solve the problem, with the field joint having the number one priority, then we stand in jeopardy of losing a flight along with all the launch pad facilities.\" The memo was signed by R. M. Boisjoly and concurred to by J. R. Kopp, Manager, Applied Mechanics, who was my boss. During the July-August time period, NASA headquarters in Washington, D. C. asked MTI to prepare and present a summary of problems with all the booster seals on August 19, 1985. This was done and that is why Ifind it so incredible that top NASA management denies knowing anything about the problems with the joint seals, when questioned by the Presidential Commission. MTI was then asked by NASA MSFC in September to send a representative to the SAE Conference in October to discuss the joint seal designs and solicit help from the technical experts in attendance. However, Iwas given strict instructions, which come from MSFC, not to express the critical urgency of fixing the joints but to only emphasize the joint improvement aspect during my presentation. Iprepared and presented seven Viewgraphs to approximately 130 technical experts at the conference. Ithen asked for help in the form of design improvement suggestions and stated that we were not asking for free advice but were willing to contract for work, but no one said a word. So Bob Ebeling and Ispent the remainder of the convention time meeting with seal vendors whom we had previously contacted for help. In retrospect, I'm not surprised that no one responded to my pleas for help when Ishowed them the parameters of the joints. What they saw and heard were joint gap configurations (both static and dynamic) that were approximately an order of magnitude worse than anything they had previously encountered. Idon't blame them for avoiding any comments and suggestions when asked. The seal erosion task team was frustrated right from the start due to lack of management support to provide manpower and material resources necessary for us to accomplish the task of fixing the joints. Accordingly, Iwrote a series of very damning activity reports in which Ileft no room for error about my feelings due to the lack of management support. The last such report written was on October 4, 1985 and reads as follows: \"SRM Seal Problem Task Team Status.  The team generally has been experiencing trouble from the business-as-usual attitude from supporting organizations. Part of this is due to lack of understanding of how important this task team activity is and the rest is due to pure operating procedure inertia which prevents timely results to a specific request. The team met with Joe Kilminster on October 3, 1985 to discuss this problem. He wanted specific examples which he was given and he simply concluded that it was every team member's responsibility to flog problems that occurred to organizational supervision and work to remove the road block by getting the required support to solve the problem. The problem was further explained to require almost full-time nursing of each task to insure it is taken to completion by a support group. Joe simply agreed and said we should then nurse every task we have. He plain doesn't understand that there are not enough people to do that kind of nursing of each task, but he doesn't seem to mind directing that the task nevertheless gets done. For example, the team just found out that when we submit a request to purchase an item, that it goes through approximately six to eight people before a purchase order is written and the item actually ordered. The vendors we are working with on seals and spacer rings have responded to our requests in a timely manner, yet, we (MTI) cannot get a purchase order to them in a timely manner. Our lab has been waiting for a function generator since September 15, 1985. The paperwork authorizing the purchase was finished by Engineering on September 24, 1985 and placed into the system. We have yet to receive the requested item. This type of example is typical and results in lost resources that had been planned to do test work for us in a timely manner. Ifor one resent working at full capacity all week long and then being required to support activity on the weekend that could have been accomplished during the week. Imight add that even NASA perceives that the team is being blocked in its engineering efforts to accomplish its task. NASA is sending an engineering representative to stay with us starting October 14th. We feel that this is the direct result of their feelings that we (MTI) are not responding quickly enough on the seal problem.  Ishould add that several of the team members requested that we be given a specific manufacturing engineer, quality engineer, safety engineer and four to six technicians to allow us to do our tests on a noninterference basis with the rest of the system. This request was deemed not necessary when Joe decided that the nursing of the task approach was directed. Finally, the basic problem boils down to the fact that all MTI problems have #1 priority and that upper management apparently feels that the SRM program is ours for sure and the customer be damned.\" The Activity Report was signed by Roger M. Boisjoly on October 4, 1985 and given to my boss's secretary. Unfortunately, Inever received any comments back and Inever knew if the contents of my activity reports were incorporated into the reports up through the management organization to the top."}]}

Acouple of boatmen advanced at once to meet him. Granet greeted them cheerily. \"Yes, Iwant a boat,\" he admitted. \"I'd like to do a bit of sailing. Afriend of mine was here and had a chap named Rowsell--Job Rowsell. Either of you answer to that name, by chance?\" The elder of the two shook his head. \"My name's Matthew Nichols,\" he announced, \"and this is my brother-in-law, Joe Lethbridge. We've both of us got stout sailing craft and all the recommendations a man need have. As for Job Rowsell, well, he ain't here--not just at this moment, so to speak.\" Granet considered the matter briefly. \"Well,\" he decided, \"it seems to me Imust talk to this chap Rowsell before Ido anything. I'm under a sort of promise.\" The two boatmen looked at one another. The one who had addressed him first turned a little away. \"Just as you like, sir,\" he announced. \"No doubt Rowsell will be up this way towards afternoon.\" \"Afternoon? But Iwant to go out at once,\" Granet protested. Matthew Nichols removed his pipe from his mouth and spat upon the ground thoughtfully. \"Idoubt whether you'll get Job Rowsell to shift before mid-day. I'm none so sure he'll go out at all with this nor-wester blowing.\" \"What's the matter with him?\" Granet asked. \"Is he lazy?\" The man who as yet had scarcely spoken, swung round on his heel. \"He's no lazy, sir,\" he said. \"That's not the right word. But he's come into money some way or other, Job Rowsell has. There's none of us knows how, and it ain't our business, but he spends most of his time in the public-house and he seems to have taken a fancy for night sailing alone, which to my mind, and there are others of us as say the same, ain't none too healthy an occupation.  And that's all there is to be said of Job Rowsell, as Iknows of.\" \"It's a good deal, too,\" Granet remarked thoughtfully. \"Where does he live?\" \"Fourth house on the left in yonder street,\" Matthew Nichols replied, pointing with his pipe. \"Maybe he'll come if you send for him, maybe he won't.\" \"Imust try to keep my word to my friend,\" Granet decided. \"If Idon't find him, I'll come back and look for you fellows again.\" He turned back to the little writing-room, scribbled a note and sent it down by the boots. In about half an hour he was called once more out into the garden. Ahuge, loose-jointed man was standing there, unshaven, untidily dressed, and with the look in his eyes of a man who has been drinking heavily. \"Are you Job Rowsell?\" Granet inquired. \"That's my name,\" the man admitted. \"Is there anything wrong with it?\" \"Not that Iknow of,\" Granet replied. \"Iwant you to take me out sailing. Is your boat ready?\" The man glanced up at the sky. \"Idon't know as Iwant to go,\" he grumbled. \"There's dirty weather about.\" \"Ithink you'd better,\" Granet urged. \"I'm not a bad payer and Ican help with the boat. Let's go and look at her any way.\" They walked together down to the harbour. Granet said very little, his companion nothing at all. They stood on the jetty and gazed across to where the sailing boats were anchored. \"That's the Saucy Jane,\" Job Rowsell indicated, stretching out a forefinger. Granet scrambled down into a small dinghy which was tied to the side of the stone wall. \"We'd better be getting on board,\" he suggested. Rowsell stared at him for a moment but acquiesced. They pulled across and boarded the Saucy Jane. Aboy whom they found on the deck took the boat back.  Rowsell set his sails slowly but with precision. The moment he stepped on board he seemed to become an altered man. \"Where might you be wanting to go?\" he asked. \"You'll need them oilskins, sure.\" \"Iwant to run out to the Bishop Lighthouse,\" Granet announced. Rowsell shook his head. It's no sort of a day to face the Atlantic, sir,\" he declared. \"We'll try a spin round St. Mary and White Island, if you like.\" Granet fastened his oilskins and stooped for a moment to alter one of the sails. \"Look here,\" he said, taking his seat at the tiller, \"this is my show, Job Rowsell. There's a five pound note for you at the end of the day, if you go where Itell you and nowhere else.\" The man eyed him sullenly. Afew minutes later they were rushing out of the harbour. \"It's a poor job, sailing a pleasure boat,\" he muttered. \"Not many of us as wouldn't sell his soul for five pounds.\" They reached St. Agnes before they came round on the first tack. Then, with the spray beating in their faces, they swung around and made for the opening between the two islands. For a time the business of sailing kept them both occupied. In two hours' time they were standing out towards Bishop Lighthouse. Job Rowsell took a long breath and filled a pipe with tobacco.  He was looking more himself now. \"I'll bring her round the point there,\" he said, \"and we'll come up the Channel and home by Bryher.\" \"You'll do nothing of the sort,\" Granet ordered. \"Keep her head out for the open sea till Itell you to swing round.\" Rowsell looked at his passenger with troubled face. \"Are you another of 'em?\" he asked abruptly. \"Don't you mind who Iam,\" Granet answered. \"I'm on a job I'm going to see through. If a fiver isn't enough for you, make it a tenner, but keep her going where Iput her.\" Rowsell obeyed but his face grew darker. He leaned towards his passenger. \"What's your game?\" he demanded hoarsely. \"There's some of them on the island'd have me by the throat if they only knew the things Icould tell 'em.  What's your game here, eh? Are you on the cross?\" \"Iam not,\" Granet replied, \"or Ishouldn't have needed to bring you to sea.  Iknow all about you, Job Rowsell. You're doing very well and you may do a bit better by and by. Now sit tight and keep a still tongue in your head.\" They were in a queer part of the broken, rocky island group. There was a great indenture in the rocks up which the sea came hissing; to the left, round the corner, the lighthouse. Granet drew what looked to be a large pocket-handkerchief from the inner pocket of his coat, pulled down their pennant with nimble fingers, tied on another and hauled it up. Job Rowsell stared at him. \"What's that?\" \"It's the German flag, you fool,\" Granet answered. \"I'll have none of that on my boat,\" the man declared surlily. \"An odd fiver for a kindness--\" \"Shut up!\" Granet snapped, drawing his revolver from his pocket. \"You run the boat and mind your own business, Rowsell. I'm not out here to be fooled with. . . .My God!\" Almost at their side the periscope of a submarine had suddenly appeared.  Slowly it rose to the surface. An officer in German naval uniform struggled up and called out. Granet spoke to him rapidly in German. Job Rowsell started at them both, then he drew a flask from his pocket and took a long pull. The submarine grew nearer and Granet tossed a small roll of paper across the chasm of waters. All that passed between the two men was to Job Rowsell unintelligible. The last few words, however, the German repeated in English. \"The Princess Hilda from Southampton, tomorrow at midnight,\" he repeated thoughtfully. \"Well, it's a big business.\" \"It's worth it,\" Granet assured him. \"They may call it a hospital ship but it isn't. Iam convinced that the one man who is more dangerous to us than any other Englishman, will be on board.\" \"It shall then be done,\" the other promised. \"So!\" He looked upward to the flag and saluted Granet. Agreat sea bore them a little apart. Granet pulled down the German flag, tied up a stone inside it and threw it into the next wave. \"You can take me back now,\" he told the boatman. They were four hours making the harbour. Three times they failed to get round the last point, met at each time by clouds of hissing spray. When at last they sailed in, there was a little crowd to watch them. Nichols and Lethbridge stood on one side with gloomy faces. \"It's a queer day for pleasure sailing,\" Nicholas remarked to Job Rowsell, as he came up the wet steps of the pier. \"It's all Iwant of it for a bit, any way,\" Rowsell muttered, pushing his way along the quay. \"If there's any of you for a drink, I'm your man. What-ho, Nichols?--Lethbridge?\" Lethbridge muttered something and turned away. Nichols, too, declined. \"Iam not sure, Job Rowsell,\" the latter declared, \"that Ilike your money nor the way you earn it.\" Job Rowsell stopped for a minute. There was an ugly look in his sullen face. \"If you weren't my own bother-in-law, Matthew Nichols,\" he said, \"I'd shove those words down your throat.\" \"And if you weren't my sister's husband,\" Nichols retorted, turning away, \"I'd take a little trip over to Penzance and say a few words at the Police Station there.\" Granet laughed good-humouredly. \"You fellows don't need to get bad-tempered with one another,\" he observed.  \"Look here, Ishall have three days here. I'll take one of you each day--make a fair thing of it, eh? You to-morrow, Nichols, and you the next day Lethbridge. I'm not particular about the weather, as Job Rowsell can tell you, and I've sailed a boat since Iwas a boy. I'm no land-lubber, am I, Rowsell?\" \"No, you can sail the boat all right,\" Rowsell admitted, looking back over his shoulder. \"You'd sail it into Hell itself, if one'd let you. Come on, you boys, if there's any one of you as fancies to drink. I'm wet to the skin.\" Nichols' boat was duly prepared at nine o'clock on the following morning.  Lethbridge shouted to him from the rails. \"Gentleman's changed his mind, Ireckon. He went off on the eight o'clock boat for Penzance.\" Nichols commenced stolidly to furl his sails again. \"It's my thinking Lethbridge,\" he said, as he clambered into the dinghy, \"that there's things going on in this island which you and me don't understand. I'm for a few plain words with Job Rowsell, though he's my own sister's husband.\" \"Plain words is more than you'll get from Job,\" Lethbridge replied gloomily.  \"He slept last night on the floor at the 'Blue Crown,' and he's there this morning, clamouring for brandy and pawing the air. He's got the blue devils, that's what he's got.\" \"There's money,\" Nichols declared solemnly, \"some money, that is, that does no one any good.\""}]}

Has this upward trend also upgraded their ability to mount military expeditions beyond their national borders?  Do the Chinese really want to fight the US? Like many aspects of Chinese policy the answers have more than one side.  Yes, the Chinese could hurt us very badly in the short term.  They have 500 ballistic missiles and build 75 more each year.  Also, they have the best and latest that the Russian defense industry can build.  This has been advantageous to Russia because it helps them maintain these industries even when the Russian Government can't necessarily buy an economic order quantity of their wares. The \"no\" side of the question relates to logisitical sustainability.  The Chinese do not produce high quality metals themselves.  They cannot build the types of rolled steel alloys necessary to armor tanks against KE missiles.  They also depend heavily on imports to sustain what industries they have.  China would have to win a major quickly.  Otherwise, the Chinese might use themselves up early, like a poorly conditioned boxer, then, as Japan did in World War II, get nailed with the haymakers towards the end. It seems increasingly likely that the more nationalistic elements of China's government and society would like to take the US down a notch or two.  Like many other countries, they see the US presence abroad as a sign of our domination and their inability to prevent that domination.  They resent our support for Taiwan and would like more than anything to reclaim the island in a way that utterly humiliates the United States. This perhaps provides the normative underpinning to their new \"Assassin's Mace\" weaponry program.  Based on a doctrine called \"The Inferior Defeats The Superior\"  when roughly translated from Chinese, this doctrine calls for the Chinese military to develop a series of weapon systems that enable it to nuetralize the C4I advantages of a superior, more modern, military force so that the battle can occur on a lower technology battlefield. While the Chinese may want to take over Taiwan, there still remain obstacles to this course of action not limited to the proximity of The US Navy.  The Chinese may have upwards of 111 million people who have undergone military training at some time in their lives, but that doesn't mean they have enough airlift and sealift capability to make it to Taiwan. Also, the Taiwanese own many more modern fighter aircraft and have far more experience in training their pilots how to fly them.  Thus, even if they destroy the US Navy's C4I grid over Asia and fire enough cruise missiles and SRBMs to keep our surface fleet at bay, they may be losing the third dimension of the battlefield and thus not have what every attacking force absolutely needs; freedom of manuever. China also suffers from some societal pressures that would possibly preempt prolonged military aggression on the part of it's government.  By limiting the number of children families could legally create, the Chinese have given themsleves what Thomas P. M. Barnett describes as the \"1-2-4 Problem.\"  Here one Chinese young adult supports a mom, a dad and four hungry grand parents.  It's an inverted monetary pyramid that makes the US Social Security system look almost sane and logical. If too many of the \"1's\" get killed in a major war, China has a social problem that their fledgling modern economy may not be able to solve.  However, this rests upon the benign assumption that the Chinese leaders care more about the welfare of their own people than they do about gaining international power and influence.  Sometimes that's a safe assumption.... The bottom line remians that China will always remain a dangerous potential adversary.  They will always want us out of Taiwan and will always want to pay back Japan for the Rape of Nanking and other heinous attrocities committed in The Second World War.  Both of these goals are thwarted on a daily basis because the US has a lot of fire power stationed where the Chinese wish we would not meddle.  This puts us in an inexorable competition with The Chinese that could easily turn just as bloody as it once did on The Korean Peninsula.  Thus, if we were smart, we'd remain very afraid of The Assassin's Mace.

Isee people talking about the Rat Pope's homophobia, misogyny (did his doctoral thesis on St. Augustine!), intolerance, rigid hard-line attitudes, his almost blatant electioneering from the Vatican for Bush, his condemnation of other faiths and on and on and on and on. Well, now it is time to turn attention to the Biblical admonitions against unclean menstruating women and a return to animal sacrifice. The saddest part is that they only took 2 days to pick this guy. That means it was pretty unanimous. Ican't wait to see what dark ages this takes us to. Hail to the new Nazi Pope! Back to the Dark Ages! Hile Pope Ratzinger .....no wonder so many people have left the catholic church....now they can try to strenthen their flock via 3rd world countries.... Well, that explainds the red, black and white robes......what a f***** up world....a Nazi Pope... What can one expect from a filthy Nazi? the catholic church has always trived on violence - any belief that it is a peaceful church is delusional. This from a Nazi bastard wearing a dress - and no doubt with a past in child-molesting. Can we say projecting our sexual guilt on others, perhaps? WHY WHY WHY anyone would belong to this Church is beyond me. Especially if you are gay OR a woman. It's almost like the gay Log Cabin Repubs. But worse. The only way the Catholic Church will change is for people to wake up and see they are fools for following it or continuing to call themselves Catholic. Surely of the 60 million americans who do - only a handful actually follow it all to a Tanyway. WAKE up SHEEPLE! Iguess he doesn't get called Holy Father - he'd prefer Mein Fuhrer. Now that we have Pope Adolf 1, that should be more clear to everyone. Here's a standout, even amongst this crowd- note the KKK spelling of Catholic, and advocating \"nuking\" the Vatican: Maybe they're trying to incite the Religious War that every right winger has been waiting for for so long. The arrogance and insensitivity involved with putting a freak like this in charge of the kathlick church is sure to piss off a lot of people (Jews, WWII vets of all religions and nationalities). Perhaps someone will finally nuke vatican city after this brilliant move by 115 senile, out-of-touch old men (in dresses). So why this screed of unadulterated hate speech from the 'compassionate, caring liberals'?  They didn't get to intimidate The Vatican into selecting a Pope they approved of, so now they are going to throw their temper tantrum.

The term originated in the days before Constantine decreed Rome a Christian Empire.  The Pagans lived far a field from Rome and grew its food supply in orchards and grain fields.  They were often looked down upon as stupid and ill-informed. The noun had a negative connotation to it; like calling somebody a peckerwood today. Fast-forwarding to modern America gives us a totally different view.  The modern zeitgeist concerning religion has been informed by the writings on Engels and Marx who describe religion as \"the opiate of the masses.\" While most well-educated people would admit that Marxism had severe shortcomings, this view of religion has taken hold with force amongst the self-selecting intellectual elite in modern America.  This view of religion held by Marx, Nietzsche and many other Post-Enlightenment philosophers has made agnosticism, if not outright Christophobia, an unstated requirement to be admitted into this circle of intellectual brilliance.  In essence, these people have come to feel they prove a certain toughness and superiority by casting religion aside and proving they don't need to walk with a crutch. This puts them outside the intellectual and social realm of the rest of America.  They respond to this the same way the supercilious elite of The Roman Republic responded to being surrounded by a bunch of back-woods illiterates who worshipped the tree-spirits.  Rather than stopping to question the dissonance they experience from people who don't share their views on subjects such as abortion, euthanasia, or the basic decency of Pope John Paul II, they scoff at such things the way Sulla and his good old boy network would have laughed at the practitioners of Nature Worship in Pre-Imperial Gaul. Or, they go strongly to the ad hominum and attempt to intimidate any who oppose their views into silence.  Recently, The Drudge Retort, ran a story about John Paul II receiving nutrition through a tube in his nose during the last days of his coalescence.  The comments were truly illuminating.  Here's a sampling of what our enlightened elite had to say about the then mortally ill pontiff. 1) Time to let the old fart go.... All he can do is barely wave. He can not even give a sermon.... PULL THE TUBE!!! 2) No. Keeping him alive cripples the power of the Catholic church. Leave it. 3) Kinda like Ah gets new-trition from the rolled up hunerd dollar bills stuck up mah nose! SSnniiiiifff!! Ahhh! (signed GWBUSH) Now these are the very deep thoughts of a group of people who consider themselves far superior to the rest of the human race.  Aself-selecting elite that finds itself increasingly disconnected from the rest of the country around them.  Perhaps a few of these geniuses would wake up one morning and wonder how terrifically brilliant they really were if 7 out of 10 people lived a totally different life than they did and were basically glad of it. But they don't. When they don't blame it on others, a la John Edwards' \"Two Americas Speech\", they consider it an affirmation of their own superiority. While I'm not sure Jack Kelly accurately predicts a 4th Great Awakening over the Terri Schiavo incident, there is a genuine philosophical need to define what constitutes a human being, and how that life should be valued.  Engaging that debate without a biased understanding of Christian Theology regarding that subject could very well be like showing up to a gun fight with only a knife.  Religion will inform the politics of tomorrow no matter what the elitists believe. This may not presage the dreaded Rovian Theocracy that many on the left currently rail against.  Jimmy Carter won the presidency with the strong support of religious voters and Bill Clinton didn't give those votes away without a fight.  However, this is because both Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton knew that they had to at least follow the example of Henry of Navarre and accept that maybe Paris was after all worth the mass.

This was a fairly boring and uneventful two months except for one peculiarity. These two guys Iknew but wasn't really buddy-buddy with in High School, I'll call them Huey and Louie, kept trying to get me interested in this phenominal opportunity. This phenominal opportunity was something called \"interactive marketing.\" This was the current euphemism for AMWAY. These guys had been duped into joining a pyramid scheme and now were looking for a way off the bottom. All of a sudden they noticed \"Good Old Steve\" was back in town and they both hoped to latch on to the sucker who would take them off the hook. Needless to say, Ihad no real desire to sell scented soaps and Fruit Of The Loom underwear to 20 of my closest friends. It took me about two weeks to get rid of Huey and Louie and as far as Iknow, they still have that lifetime supply of mens underwear stashed in their parents' garage somewhere. However, it wouldn't surprise me if a lot of younger Americans felt the same desperation with the US Government's very own federally funded pyramid scheme. Namely, Social Security. Arecent report by the Social Security Trustees, does nothing to asuage the sense that the generation of workers now aged 25 to 35, are the newest suckers with the garages full of scented soap and unmentionables. The excellent blog Cold Hearted Truth tells us that according to the Trustees, \"benefits are scheduled, not garunteed.\" Run that one by your attorney for a smarm check. An FAQ at the Social Secuity website ( www.ssa.gov ) gives us a more comprehensive, and even less reassuring, explanation of how SS will not work. The gory details follow below. Q. I'm 35 years old. If nothing is done to improve Social Security, what can Iexpect to receive in retirement benefits from the program? A. Unless changes are made, at age 73 your scheduled benefits could be reduced by 27 percent and could continue to be reduced every year thereafter from presently scheduled levels. See the 2004 Trustees Report Q. I'm 25 years old. If nothing is done to change Social Security, what can Iexpect to receive in retirement benefits from the program? A. Unless changes are made, when you reach age 63 in 2042, benefits for all retirees could be cut by 27 percent and could continue to be reduced every year thereafter. If you lived to be 100 years old in 2079 (which will be more common by then), your scheduled benefits could be reduced by 33 percent from today's scheduled levels. See the 2004 Trustees Report Q. Should Icount on Social Security for all my retirement income? A. No. Social Security was never meant to be the sole source of income in retirement. It is often said that a comfortable retirement is based on a \"three-legged stool\" of Social Security, pensions and savings. American workers should be saving for their retirement on a personal basis and through employer-sponsored or other retirement plans. Thus, we have a pension system that promised more than it can deliver and based itself on a pyramid scheme. Thus, the older people who already contributed their whole working lives want to make sure they get what they feel they were promised. For the younger people, these benefits weren't promised, they were scheduled. Like a minor league baseball game, these benefits can seemingly get unscheduled in a hurry the next time an older member of Congress feels like raiding the Social Security Trust Fund and leaving a risible IOU in the account instead. Therefore, the taxes we younger members of the workforce pay for Social Security go into a lock-box. The benfits we are supposed to get back out are only \"scheduled.\" America's so-called safety net has left it's younger generation at the base of a SCAMWAY pyramid.

To whit, he has strongly reccommended we reassure both Iran and Syria that our intentions in Iraq will not cause either of them any harm. Except this would not be honest. Any action we take effects these countries. They have fundamentally organized themselves around opposing us and condemning our society and way of life. So if we are in Iraq, and we organize it to resemble the United States in any way, shape or fashion, we drop the gauntlet in front of the leadership in both of these nations. They can pick it up, or they can suffer the penalties that accrue to cowards. While niether country can put armed formations against our Iraq force openly, they are currently using Fabian tactics in hopes that our population will demand our leadership to remove our forces from Iraq. This very well may work against the US. It has in the past. However, reassuring two countries wo are selling weapons and providing logistical support to a guerrilla force bent on our destruction will not make these countries abate. It will enhance their belief in the effort they are engaged in. The rewards of cravenness then arrive in our inbox. Thus, when Barracks Emperor Wastely Clark demands that the House of Representatives hold hearings about what we will do if Syria collapses, we should mail The General Emeritus a bottle of champagne and a party favor.

Sanctity - Why Should I Get To Live?"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "It didn't used to require a PhD in Philosophy to tell whether Peter Singer was a nutcase or a genius. The Associated Press reported Singer's comments: \"Ido think that it is sometimes appropriate to kill a human infant,\" he said, adding that he does not believe a newborn has a right to life until it reaches some minimum level of consciousness.\" \"For me, the relevant question is, what makes it so seriously wrong to take a life?\" Singer asked.\"Those of you who are not vegetarians are responsible for taking a life every time you eat. Species is no more relevant than race in making these judgments.\" Iwon't persume credentials Ihaven't earned, but this humble man opines that Peter Singer is niether. He is evil. As evil as evil gets and meaner than the Balrog, who nearly dispatched Gandolf, deep underground, in The Mines of Moria. Now that wasn't a particularly nuanced statement. In fact it was downright judgemental, if you ask me. That's also OK in my book. God issued me judgement, Iuse it. That makes me judgemental. Not judgemental in the sense that Judge Greer was judgemental. Ididn't just yank a feeding tube out of anyone's throat and let them dry out and expire like a beached suckerfish on La Playa Del Rio. That's not only judgemental, that's flat-out cold. It also involves making a decision based on crappy information that is itself based on a graveman that does not stand the test of truth. Judge Greer has assumed away the sanctity of life. He's based his decision on the faulty assumption that he can scientifically determine the value of a human life and thereby terminate said life if it imposes a cost to society greater than it's benefit. I'll proceed from a more fundamentally honest premise. I'd never just chuck the sanctity of life ona lark. Ilike the idea of other people holding my life sacred. After being stretchered off a rugby pitch and taken in for surgery once, I'm really fond of my life having sanctity and having doctors treat it with such. Iappreciate those guys wholeheartedly. People will say that I'm in favor of the sanctity of life because I'm in fear for my own skin. I'd answer the way Robert Dinero's character Sam did in the movie Ronin. I'd look at the guy like he was an idiot and state the obvious. \"It covers my body.\" That's one objection to abolishing sanctity of life in favor of quality of life, now here's another one. Judge Greer attempts to convince us that he can measure the quality of Terri Schiavo's life. Again, I'll be more honest with you. Ican't tell you the true, intrinsic value of a can of green beans. If a were a dialectical materialist, Iwould add the value of the intrinsic materials to the skill of the labor endowed. If Iwere Milton Friedman, I'd ask what my nieghbor logically perceives this can of beans to be worth. If Iwere Confuscious, I'd take Beano first so that Iwouldn't offend the others at the dinner table. There you have it. Niether I, nor Hegel, nor Kierkagaard nor Judge Greer can tell you what a can of green beans should really be worth. We, as fallable human beings, are in no position whatsoever to stick a price tag on Terri Schiavo's forehead. It really is that simple. I'm not a good enough Christian to claim God told me to protect Terri Schiavo. I'm not even close to being smart enough to tell you objectively that Terri Schiavo's life or even a can of green beans had a positive intrinsic value that does not depend a certain leap of faith. But on this one, I'll swallow my agnosticism and the egoism that it entails. Iwant life to have a certain, inviolate sanctity. Iwant this because Iwant my life to be treated like it has an intrinsic value, and because, as an analyst and a person who spends his professional life calculating values, this is one analysis I'm utterly underqualified to perform and hope that Inever have to pull the trigger on. I'm not sure what scares me and p-ss-s me off more. Judge Greer deciding that Terri Schiavo should have been killed, someone deciding that Judge Greer was qualified to decide such a thing, or Judge Greer believing he had the normative prowess to make this decision. Whether you live a life that is the perfect imitation of Christ or whether you behave like Iused to on Saturday Night, monotheism is an excellent principal to leave intact. Let God evaluate the value of Terri Schiavo and hope that others will let him do the same in terms of the value of your existence as well. Update I:  Wizbang posts a picture gallery in memory of Terri Schiavo. Update II: Idon't totally buy into VodkaPundit's take on this, but Imust admit, he really says it well. Update III:  Judge Birch not only represents everything I'm afraid of in a judiciary, he's also a sadistic little creep. If he didn't believe The Schiavos had a legal leg to stand on, he should have just rejected their appeal and called it a day.

Just when it looks like no one has an ounce of sanity left in them at all. Something surprising happens that completely knocks me off kilter and forces me to reevaluate. Today, finally, the LAPD has received a wake-up call on illegal immigration. Today, they finally realized that allowing a gang like MS-13 to operate out of the barrios of East LA could not coexist with their mission of upholding the law and protecting the peace. Against a stark backdrop of growing violence and audacity from members of Mara Salvatruca - 13, the LAPD finally has woken up to the problem on their doorstep. \"The LAPD is working on language that would direct officers who see suspects they believe to be felons in the U.S. illegally to call their supervisors for a check with immigration officials, Assistant Police Chief George Gascon said. If a person is determined to be here illegally, federal authorities would seek an arrest warrant from a judge. At that point, LAPD officers could arrest the suspect. The move comes several months after the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department changed its policy and began checking the immigration status of foreign-born inmates in County Jail and turning illegal immigrants over to the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency. Additionally, the LAPD's Rampart Division has been working with immigration officials on a special task force designed to crack down on violent gangs whose members go back and forth from the U.S. to Central America.\" - LA Times The spread of MS-13 to every corner of the US and throughout Central and South America particularly embarasses the LAPD. The first American outpost for these drug and weapon smugglers was 13th Street, which runs near Rampart Station. LA has become home to one of the first immigrant street gangs to legitimately become a terrorist organization since La Cosa Nostra. While the LAPD has been under executive order not to cooperate with Federal Immigration Officials, MS-13 grew wealthy, grew strong, grew audacious and grew in stature. It even had business meetings with representatives from Al Quaida. When the local drug selling operation negotiates with Al Quaida, this problem cannot remain solely under local jurisdiction. MS-13 elevated its profile even further in the ongoing issue over what is being done or not done to secure the US border between Mexico and Arizona. Agroup of US activists calling themselves \"The Minuteman Project\" recently announced it would assist the Border Patrol by standing watch over the border and calling in the police any time they spotted illegals. The leadership of MS-13 resented their border being appropriated in this fashion and threatened them with violence. This led the Department of Homeland Security to send in 500 agents. MS-13's arrogance and shamelessly brazen contempt for the law have finally brought the immigration issue out of the dark. It was a leader of MS-13 in LA who finally got the LAPD to take action. \"Senior LAPD officials have been talking about creating clearer guidelines for Special Order 40 for years. But the issue came to a head several months ago in Hollywood.Agroup of officers came face to face with a Mara Salvatrucha gang leader walking down the street, Capt. Mike Downing said. The officers believed that the man had been deported after being convicted in a string of violent crimes a few years ago.There was a debate over what the officers could do. In the end, the LAPD decided to get immigration officials involved. Immigration and Customs Enforcement determined the man had reentered the United States illegally and received a federal warrant for his arrest.\" - LA Times. Sometimes people get drunk on power and totally overplay their hand. MS-13 had gotten away with murder and everything else for decades. They treated the US Border with open contempt and laughed at any concept of it as a deterrent to their evil. Now they've laughed too loudly, and maybe the law will finally begin to get enforced."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "posted by SDH | 9:19 AM |"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Whither North Korea?

Because everyone's suffering becomes a major problem for us.  We are the world, we always get stuck feeding the children.

Prices Don't Just Go Up."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "No one really likes it when a product increases at a price that's twice the rate of inflation. This quickly puts that product out of the reach of the average consumer. Predictably, the mourners will sing about how it is all unfair. This has been especially true in the case of health care costs. Health care costs in this nation are going up at double the rate of inflation and now cost $600 billion a year or a debilitating 11.5% of our gross national product. By comparison, Canada spends 8.5% of its gross national product on health care; Japan 6.7% and Britain 6.2%. By the year 2,000 it is estimated that if health care costs continue to rise at today's rates that we will be spend-ing 15% of our gross national product on health care and at that point even our big auto companies will break under the cost burden. If America's premier manufacturing companies will not be able to afford employee health care - who will? - Mike Westfall (1990) Who can afford employee health care? The government. And that, Ladies and Germs, is the graveman of the problem. Health care is no longer retailed in this country, it's auctioned. Even worse than that, it's not just auctioned, it's auctioned via a rigged scheme. As long as that remains the case, you'd better look twice before crossing the busy thoroughfare. Here's how health care came to be auctioned, rather than retailed. The people who paid for health care started out being, by and large, individual consumers. This put a ceiling on how much the drug companies, hospitals and physicians could bill. My vastly empty wallet was a sure fire cost control mechanism. People then began to recognize that they could manage risk and pool funds. Several people with a small likelihood of requiring a procedure could gang up and easily pay for the cost of the one poor unlucky soul who needed it. The insurance policy and health plan were born. Doctors and drug inventors, by their professional nature, are not stupid people. They quickly realized that if people had more money to buy a product, they could afford it even if it cost a whole bunch more. This happened in short order, and people once more became highly concerned that they could not afford the services of medical professionals, even with a health plan. This situation became exacerbated further, because insurers and health plan coordinators could also manage risk by controlling who was allowed to kick into the pool. People who exhibited health characteristics that led to frequent or expensive demands on the money pool had to pay in more to join or were banned outright. They were still charged for health care as if they were part of a unified money pool. At this point, the health care market was now an auction market. When a consumer could no longer afford to bid high enough for a scarce MRI or HIV drug, they lost. This is how auction markets work at Southerby's or anywhere else in the world in which they occur. This is not a problem at Southerby's, because no one is going to die if they don't have an original Renoir to hang in the drawing room. They may very well die soon if they don't have a check for colon cancer. Hence, a lot of people felt intense pain at having to participate in an auction to get health care. Members of the government looked at this situation and saw that the people who would need certain health care services the most would not have them made available unless they were wealthy dillitantes. They then proceeded to pave the road to Stygian health care costs with the finest and most noble of intentions. When the government entered the health care market, they became a unique consumer for two important reasons. They could outbid anyone who moved. Their pot of money was The Federal Budget. The Federal Budget is profoundly resourced and has a level of credit that far outstrips the actual cash account that the IRS brings in each year. No matter how badly we bloat our deficit, it's still going to be a long, long time before The Federal Reserve actually issues a junk Treasury Bond. The people setting the prices had the ability to collude via there lobbyists and convince this bidder to actually inflate it's bid. The AMA lobbied assiduously for the US Government to spend more on health care because of the high costs. The government bid higher, the medical professionals then jacked up the prices. The recursion here doesn't take Einstein to figure out. You can see a very similar regression line with college tuitions and Pell Grants. What's the only humane solution? More Pell Grants. What happens when the government pumps in more liquidity? Higher tuition."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "So what do many advocates of fixing this problem reccommend? National Health Care plans. Letting the government be the only payer for health care. This would constitute an unmitigated disaster on several levels. The government would price health care where ever a lobbyist told them to. This would bear no legitimate relation to what the services cost. If they made health care too cheap, everyone would demand it at a larger level than necessary. This would flood hospitals with claims that at least quasi-hypochondriatic. Drugs, vaccinations and the time of highly skilled doctors would become too scarce. The average patient would son have little or no chance of getting these services. This is why Canadian patients wait for months to get an MRI. Sure, it's a cheap MRI compared to the US, but that's why a few million other people are in line and that MRI scanner won't be available for another year or two. If they price the health care too expensively, you'd have The Prescription Drug Panderation Act. It would wreck our budget and drive our Medicare Program several years closer to bankruptcy. It would hyper-inflate the cost of every prescription drug on the market even more than the current regime. It would sure suck out loud if The President and Congress wanted to saddle us with a really stupid bill like that one. So that's how we get a leviathan-like government and no health care. We keep recruiting a richer designated payer for health care costs and then wonder why the product costs go up far faster than the level of value provided via the services. It's a prima-face example of how you wind up with something for nothing when greed and fear replace intellectual thought in the market place. Doctors and drug makers will provide a certain level of value, no matter who pays for the service. The more cash gets pumped into that particular market, the more these people will vaccuum it off the table without increasing the value they provide. Giving the whole thing over to the government or a big HMO won't fix it either. That will cause your prostate surgery to be priced by a cost accountant or a GS-13 Operations Research Analyst. I'd rather have my medical bill tallied up by someone who's done an operation or two. The key to killing off greedy insurers, unethical Doctors and power-lusting government bureaucrats before they become parasites who live off our medical field is to end the hyperinflation. Cut off the money and you cut off the bad guys from their oxygen. When the average American goes to the pharmacist, there should be a single payer.

It was a Commodore 64 , which I’d been ogling for the better part of a year, ever since Ibecame mistyfied by my first encounter with a computer mouse. Computers were going to change the face of the Earth back then, you see? We were all going to become millionaires if we got into computing. It was bullshit, but it was very appealing bullshit, and we all bought it. Liked it, too. Mothers drove in hordes to enroll their kids in computer classes. Ibegged my parents to get me in on the digital revolution that was going to shape the future. Of course they couldn’t refuse. The school’s name was “Galileo Center”. They had small branches strewn all over the country and a cheap tie-in TV programme that aired Saturday mornings and featured kids competing in games of manic miner and jetpac for paltry prizes and promotions. Considering the air of campiness that surrounded it, it was surprisingly competent as a programming school. Idid Karel . Idid LOGO . Idid BASIC , Graphic BASIC and Pascal. Many years later Ifound myself using an utterly new thing called the internet. Unlike computers themselves, the world-changing potential of this newfangled stuff wasn’t that apparent. Its main purpose seemed to be allowing anti-social geeks like myself to download the full script to all of Monty Python ’s movies, ASCII porn ( yes, there was such a thing ) and engage in virtual text battles inside imaginary worlds . But it changed things all right. It started a new dialogue among like minded individuals. Atruly remarkable feat if I’ve ever seen one. I’m not talking about your grandmother who emails her niece and sends pictures via the mail thingie in her home computer. I’m talking about those of us who work with the very infrastructure of this new beast. Those who couldn’t possibly conceive a day without the internet. We. The compulsive Slashdot refreshers, the boingboing ers, the acronym-gobblers, the architects and designers and programmers whose very livelihood is dependent on the flow of ones and zeroes. Our words are bits and our statements are programs. We have come to know each other’s bugs and learned to cope with them. We have resisted authority. We have lost and we have won . We have found ways to beat the system and we have developed altogether new systems to cope with our ever-increasing desire for information. Because information, its free flow and its sharing is what will ultimately make a difference in this Big Old World™ .

The whole spectacle was depressing. It was as if the weather knew of my arrival. The arrival of… THE DARK ONE!!! That will be my identity for this blog. This will avoid endangering those close to me when my opinions make the people in the high spheres of power nervous. The dark one says goodbye for today. Have horrible dreams… MUAHAAHHAAHA! July 12. 2003 As Imeditated about the best ways of torturing and upsetting a squirrel ( but Ijust meditated, because it’s not good killing squirrels, heehehehee ) Icame upon the realization that my voice now carries tremendous power. Having an online influence like mine begets responsibility. Although Ican’t deny that my influence would be ultimately benefical for society, which definitely needs guidance. Ihave decided, therefore, to reveal my vote for the upcoming elections, amply convinced that thousands of loyal followers will feel relieved from the pressure of having to think by themselves. Vote for the Rooster party. One of the Dark One’s friends is involved in it, and Iassure you that any guy that plays The Masquerade and is in the process of becoming a Vampire by means of arcane rituals that involve huge amounts of garlic knows what he’s doing. Ibid farewell! July 15. 2003 The Rooster party didn’t win anything. Frankly, loyal readers, I’m disappointed. Ican only attribute this failure to your lack of commitment. Although Ihave to admit that I, the Dark One, couldn’t attend the voting booth either, Iassure you that there are ample and powerful reasons of great importance for that. Besides, the booth was too far away and my sister wouldn’t take me there in the car. Puerile woman. When the Dark One’s mother allows him use of the car your only use will cease! July 18. 2003 Great news! I’ve found the way to allow comments in my blog! Now you can tell the Dark One what you think! I’m going to sleep, but Ihave high hopes for this. Ihope my server can take the load. July 19. 2003 3 comments in yesterday’s post! Allow me to answer each: Vi.Agr.a On-li.ne: The Dark One does not need such things.

Ithink my site is very nice and pretty too ( Imade a big effort choosing special colors for the template, and even had to learn eichteeemel, which is a l33t programming language for the internet ). Curious, that your name is linked to a porn site. Are you that site’s wesmaster? July 20. 2003 Debbie, John, Vi.Agr.a and hu.GeCock.s, please stop leaving comments. Ibelieve you’ve said your peace and we don’t need more reaffirmation. July 21. 2003 Ifind myself in the distressing necessity  of closing comments in the blog, due to the fact that I’ve attracted obsessive commenters who leave more than 100 comments a day ( curiously enough, all of them appear to be wesmasters of pr0n sites ). The price of fame. July 22. 2003 Today Ireceived my very first hate mail from an envious individual who spews lots of silliness. In here, Itranscribe my 20-page dissertation wherein Icompletely obliterate his arguments. I’m sure he’ll seat to cry in a dark corner of his lonely room when he reads this.

Although Idon’t want to point accusatorial fingers, Iam aware that many would love to steal my poetry, so I’ve decided to send it only to those who request it to my email address ( thedarkone1524@hotmail.com ) July 26. 2003 Ithink there’s something wrong with my email address.

I’ll be developing a number of websites for a corporate group that dates back as far as 1908, as well as working out rules of engagement for all web related company endeavours. This fills me with no small amount of glee. Iconstantly catch myself browsing web design related sites and thinking Mmmhh… Ishould stop wasting time and get to work… , only to realize that now this is my work!!! . Lovely, huh? The work site is Apple only. Now, on first notice, you may peg me as a Mac hater of sorts, but Iassure you that is a common misconception. Iactually love the little buggers ever since they slapped a lickable interface over Unix. Opening a terminal to type “ ls ” every once in a while has become one of my new rituals . Regarding the ‘puter at work: Used to be a 450 Mhz G4 with 640 Mb Ram and an 80 Gb HD running Panther ( Sekhmet ). Idon’t know if it was my PC karma, but it crapped out in a week. Apps crashed, kernel extensions bonkered and even Flash and Java went awol ( On hindsight, it may have been an ill-fated decision to name her after a goddess of destruction ). So she has been replaced by Hathor , a 733 Mhz G4 with the 21” Apple CRT ( “turtle” ). The package includes one of those nifty buttonless rodents Apple makes ( Ikeep fighting the urge to take a bite from it ). Hathor is running beautifully, and has already been subjected to the addition of Quicksilver , Desktop Manager and, of course, Firefox . Unlike Sekhmet, this one has a video card that supports Quartz Extreme ( that would be the flim flam velocinator ). It feels like running through fields full of candy coated strippers, Ishit you not. At home, my lowly GeForce 2 has been replaced with a sleek ATI All In Wonder 9700 PRO. After a false start in which Ialmost burned my processor due to overheating ( note to self: Always check how tight cabling is around the processor fan, and never ignore screeching sounds coming from the ‘puter ), Ifind myself selling my soul to Far Cry , and enjoying every minute of it. Whereas in the Geforce it looked like regurgitated dogshit, now it looks like what can only be described as a visual handjob of the most prurient persuasion. Ihad already become pretty good at getting headshots on the 4 pixel tall squiggly lines that Ifigured out were soldiers, but now the little buggers are actually scary . Iwon’t discuss the trigens save to assure you that they are the stuff that fills my nightmares. Other news: Read Neverwhere . Fucking loved it. Reading Stranger in a Strange Land . Grokking it. Doing major rehaul of room furniture and life habits. Thinking seriously about restarting work on the comic. Oh… and we have free coffee at work. freecoffee freecoffee freecoffee freecoffee.

She's armed with color-coded pens, a don't-mess-with-me crease in her brow and what she calls \"my comfort latte.\" She just graduated summa cum laude , after three years of legal training that left her $115,000 in debt. Part of that debt, which she will take a decade to repay with interest, was run up at Starbucks, where she buys her lattes. Part of the $115,000 debt Kirsten Daniels of Seattle incurred to finance law school went toward her regular caffeine fix. The habit costs her nearly $3 a day, and it's one that her law school says she and legions like her cannot afford. My heart is already bleeding for poor Ms. Daniels. To think that she might be only $112,000 in debt if not for the pernicious influence of Starbucks! And might Iask how much will Ms. Daniels be earning next year? Seattle University may only be #95 in the US News & World Report rankings , but my cousin went to law school at #96, Syracuse, and he is pulling down top dollar at a New York firm these days. It borders on apostasy in this caffeine-driven town (home to more coffee shops per capita than any major U.S. city, as well as Starbucks corporate headquarters), but the law school is aggressively challenging the drinking habits of students such as Daniels. \"Alatte a day on borrowed money? It's crazy,\" said Erika Lim, director of career services at the law school. I'm glad Ms. Lim is worried about the really important things that affect her students' prospects for a successful future. To quantify the craziness, Lim distributes coffee-consumption charts. One shows that a five-day-a-week $3 latte habit on borrowed money can cost $4,154, when repaid over 10 years. She also directs students to a Web site she helped create. The \"Stop Buying Expensive Coffee and Save Calculator\" ( http://www.hughchou.org/calc/coffee.cgi ) shows that if you made your own coffee and for 30 years refrained from buying a $3 latte, you could save $55,341 (with interest). Remember how in high school they used to brink in a throat cancer survivor with an electronic voice box to tell you about the perils of smoking? Perhaps Ms. Lim can invite some impoverished middle-aged lawyers to tell the students at Seattle U. about how Starbucks forces their children to go to bed hungry at night. Inside the Starbucks across from the law school, Daniels seemed surprised -- but unmoved -- to hear all this. \"Iguess Inever had done the math,\" she said. \"On the other hand, Iwould be a very crabby person without my comfort latte.\" Therein lies the rub for those who would curb latte consumption with pocketbook reasoning. As Lim concedes, \"no one pays any attention.\" How did an ignoramus like Kirsten Daniels ever graduate summa cum laude ? Doesn't she know that counting her coffee dollars is at least as important as acing her coursework? And even if Daniels is no Einstein, Ibet she can estimate how much more she will earn as a reuslt of having a law degree. Financial planners, best-selling investment gurus and a number of advice columnists have been warning consumers for years that seemingly insignificant daily spending on such luxuries as gourmet coffee can, over time, sabotage savings and hobble a person's financial future. It's not the cigarettes. It's not the booze. It's not even McDonalds. It is the gourmet coffee that is forces senior citizens to eat cat food! But these warnings, too, have been ignored, at least as measured by the runaway growth and profitability of Starbucks, the world's leading purveyor of specialty coffee. Its stock is up more than 1,200 percent in the past 10 years. When it went public in 1992, the company had 125 stores. It now has more than 9,000 locations around the world and long-term plans for 20,000 more. Call the United Nations! Call Bono! If Starbucks opens another 20,000 locations worldwide, the poverty epidemic may never be stopped. By the way, has anyone suggested to the French and Germans that the real cause of their double-digit unemployment is Starbucks? Starbucks declined to comment for this article, referring questions to the Specialty Coffee Association of America, a trade group. Its spokesman, Mike Ferguson, said that coffee shops provide an excellent opportunity for students to do their homework... Godd***ed corporate stooges! It's people like Mike Ferguson who put a smiling face on the rape of American youth. And what about Starbucks? It's no better than a child molester walking the courthouse steps muttering to the press, \"No comment. No comment.\" In decades past, lenders chided college students for excessive spending of borrowed money on pizza and cigarettes, but the staggering ubiquity of Starbucks appears to have narrowed the nagging to foamy espresso drinks... Don't forget the famous Pizza Crisis of the 1970s! It didn't get as much attention as the oil crisis, but that's just because the Italians control the media. Which reminds me, who do you think invented espresso and cappucino? \"The question that needs to be posed is 'Do they really need to have a Starbucks every day?' \" said Jeffrey Hanson, director of borrower education service at Access Group, a Delaware-based organization that is the nation's third-largest provider of graduate school loans. \"Since they are living, in part, on borrowed money, they need to be aware of the opportunity cost of that $3 latte. Once they spend it, it is not available for a loaf of bread.\"... Hanson is right. Who do you think is really responsible for the legions of ragged students begging for crusts of bread in Cambridge and Berkeley? Starbucks, that's who. But these warnings have a way of getting lost amid the sweet aromas emanating from university-owned espresso shops inside nearly every major building on campus. The university began a major espresso expansion in 1997, after a survey found that coffee was far and away the favorite on-campus \"food.\"... It's a sad tale, but true. The thrifty young student comes to campus in pursuit of knowledge, only be to led astray by casual sex, recreational drugs and the sweet aromas of the roasted coffee bean. At Seattle University School of Law, Lim concedes the futility of persuading students to stop spending borrowed money on high-priced coffee. Still, she refuses to give up. The consequences of latte-larded law school debts are worrisome for the legal profession, she said, insidiously tilting career paths toward jobs that pay more but satisfy less. Thank God for the lonely crusaders like Erika Lim. Sure, everyone thought that the abolitionists were crazy in the 1830s and 1840s. But just as their persistence ended our enslavement to King Cotton, crusaders like Lim will liberate us from King Coffee. \"The amount of money you owe directly affects the professional choices you have,\" she said. Debt-panicked law school graduates, she said, tend to run away from low-paying jobs such as public defender (about $45,000 a year) and into the more remunerative arms of corporate law. Lim, by the way, is not a latte drinker, unless someone else pays. Just like me. Idon't frequent prostitutes unless someone else pays them. As for the lack of public defenders, Iassure you with total confidence that it has absolutely nothing to do with the rising cost of tuition at America's law schools. In closing, all Ican say is: Students of the world unite! You have nothing to lose but your chain-stores!"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "(0) opinions -- Add your opinion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "# Posted 3:46 PM by David Adesnik"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "ONLY BUSH CAN DELIVER THE MESSAGE TO UZBEKISTAN: The White House says that DoD is on board with its efforts to stand up for human rights and democracy in Uzbekistan, but the press has been reporting a split between State and Defense for some time now. While refusing to actually say that it opposes the State Department's efforts to hold Uzbek strongman Islam Karimov accountable for the recent massacre in Andijon, the military would apparently prefer to preserve access to its bases in Uzbekistan. If Bush wants Karimov to know that America is serious about human rights and democracy promotion, he will have to deliver the message himself. Otherwise, Karimov will have a strong incentive to interpret the lack of consensus in Washington as a greenlight for further repression.  Moreover, Bush will have to back his message up by making firm demands for an external investigation of the events at Andijon. Almost two weeks ago, the WaPo argued that the value of our bases in Uzbekistan is hardly enough to justify compromising our most important principles in the war on terror. There are bases available elsewhere. In contrast, our credibility will suffer a damaging blow if we allow Karimov to crush legitimate dissent in the name of fighting Islamic terrorists.

But for quite some time now, Bush has refused to make excuses for authoritarian allies.   He hasn't challenged every one the way he has Putin or Mubarak, but that takes time.

The same arguments made in favor of stopping a nuclear Iraq were also made in the early 1960s about stopping the PRC from getting the bomb (see Frank Gavins recent work on the Gilpatric Commission) and have been proven quite terribly wrong in retrospect. So maybe wow is one possible response, but another might be nuclear deterrence is pretty robust, even in the face of genocidal psychopaths. Second, you badly misrepresent Mearsheimers arguments, and the rest of realisms approach to the Cold War. He wasnt a Cold War dove in the 1980s, but neither was he a hawk as you claim  he cut his teeth arguing that the conventional balance in Europe wasnt nearly as bad for NATO as hawks like Sam Huntington and Eliot Cohen kept claiming it was (see the 1988 exchange in IS between Mearsheimer, Posen, and Cohen for an example; moreover, history has borne JJM out on this argument). His Back to the Future articles analysis was premised on US withdrawal from Europe, which didnt happen, and so the causal logic hasnt had a chance to be tested (by the way, it was 1990, not the mid-1990s). Third, its not clear that somehow Morgenthau was wrong in arguing that such fun adventures as Vietnam were not in Americas vital national interests. The twilight wars on the periphery were sideshows from defending the main strongpoints that locked up the keys to world power. Its not threat deflation to say that American vital interests were simply not involved in places like Africa. Moreover, its hard to tell exactly what youre referring to with the Cold War and realism  apparently many other realists were hawkish then too but somehow also were downgrading the threat. For the most part in the 1980s realists were arguing for robust conventional and nuclear deterrence in Europe and East Asia while trying to keep the US from getting too bogged down in the Third World. Europe mattered, while the Third World only did in certain areas and in certain ways. Amixture of hawkishness and dove-ishness. Fourth, Idont understand your critique of defensive realism as ignoring the domestic nature of regimes (an almost complete disregard). Walt writes on the effects of revolution, Van Evera on militarism, organizational politics, nationalism, and misperception (you might want to read Primed for Peace or Hypotheses on Nationalism and War or Why Cooperation Failed in WWI), Posen on military organizations (Sources of Military Doctrine), and Snyder on domestic log-rolling, bureaucracies and international expansion (Myths of Empire and The Ideology of the Offensive). Most of this was written during the Cold War or was developed during it and published very soon after. Since then, people like Tom Christensen and Randy Schweller have very seriously looked at domestic politics. So Im not really sure exactly what your point is. Snyder and Van Evera explicitly talked about democracies as being less expansionistic than dictatorships and especially oligarchic/log-rolling regimes. Maybe thats almost complete disregard but given that these are major figures its hard to see how. Some people disagree with them, while others dont think they go far enough in looking at domestic politics. But its not like domestic politics have been ignored. Fifth, Walt appears to be right that NATO is no longer a very important alliance  the US doesnt use it for much of anything, and the Europeans are slowly putting together their own power projection force. And if it does exist in some serious fashion, Idont see how thats the result of democracy. The US has been allied with Saudi Arabia and Jordan for decades too, and thats not because of democracy. Sixth, the offensive/defensive realist distinction you make is wrong  both look at armed force as the only effective deterrent. The implicit deterrent of alliances you refer to as the focus of defensive realists is backed by armed force; alliances are about armed force. The distinction between offensive and defensive realism is based on other things, like the efficiency of balancing, the probabilistic or possibilistic nature of state decision-making, the impact of nuclear weapons on deterrence, the ability to signal and detect state type, and the impact of domestic pathologies (discussed above) in leading to war. Armed force is crucial to both, as it is to any theory of international security, realist or not. So Iguess Ijust remain confused by your intellectual history of the field and current read on world politics. And Im not really comfortable with you casting sweeping aspersions on the beliefs and motives of scholars whose work you appear not to have read, at least in any detail. Realists of various stripes have been right about lots of things, have looked at the issues you claim they havent, and have offered much more nuanced arguments than you give them credit for. Theyve also been wrong about lots of issues and ignored others, obviously. Its always fun to beat up on realism but there are good and bad ways to do it."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Let me respond briefly. First of all, Ithink PS does a good job of illustrating that my previous comments can't do full justice to a scholarly enterprise in which hundreds of brilliant men and women have taken part over the past few decades. For those with a serious interest in realism, there is no replacement for reading actual books written by realists, rather than OxBlog's anti-realist polemics. That said, Istand by my basic points and continue to disagree with PS. Unless one is comfortable with the current situation in North Korea, Idon't see how one can describe deterrence as a robust response to the hypothetical situation of a nuclear Iraq (c. 2002) or Iran today. My previous point about the Cuban Missile Crisis suggests why deterrence was not ideal or safe during the Cold War, either. Second, Morgenthau deserves credit for his early opposition to the war in Vietnam. However, this in no way vindicates his persistent criticism of Truman and others for taking Soviet ideology very seriously. With regard to the 1980s and the late Cold War, Ibasically agree with PS's characterization of where the realists stood. When it comes to the defensive realists and domestic politics, Iwill avoid further discussion on the somewhat spurious grounds that this debate is too detailed and too distant from actual history and politics. (If Iam wrong, and there are a lot of you out there who want to see OxBlog wrangle over the legacy of defensive realism, just send me an e-mail.) The same point applies to the subject of the offensive-defensive divide, although in that instance Itend to agree with PS's characterization of the subject.

Yet no one knew that then and no one knows it now."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "What's interesting is that realism has a long pedigree of favoring appeasement. E.H. Carr, the founding father of realism, was a staunch supporter of Neville Chamberlain's accomodationist approach to Hitler.  And Ithink I'm not exaggerating when Isay that Hitler was the Hitler of his time. In the early 1950s, the second founding father of realism, Hans Morgenthau , viciously denounced Truman for being too hawkish toward the Soviets.  Now it is true that the other great realist of the late 40s and early 50s -- George Kennan -- elaborated the doctrine of containment.  Yet by the early 50s, Kennan had also turned against Truman on the grounds that he was too hawkish.  In fact, Kennan even opposed the creation of NATO. So what we see from Carr, to Morgenthau, to Kennan, to Kissinger, to Mearsheimer & Walt (c. 2002) is a resilient tradition of downgrading the threat presented by aggressive dictatorships.  Yet as Prof. DN would be sure to point out, Mearsheimer was the quite the hawk during the 1980s.  Many other realists were hawkish then as well. This countertrend represented the growth of an emerging divide between \"offensive\" and \"defensive\" realists.  The offensive faction tended to see the costs of aggression as low, and therefore thought of armed force as the only effective deterrent.  The defensive faction had more confidence in the implicit deterrent of alliances, for example the Sino-American willingness to punish hypothetical Soviet aggression. What united the offensive and defensive factions was an almost total disregard for the internal composition of the regimes they analyzed.  The idea that democracies don't go to war with one another struck them as being as naive and dangerous. These days, realism is in a state of flux, primarily because of the end of the Cold War.  According to almost all pre-1991 realist theory, a unipolar world is something that simply shouldn't exist.  Then, in the mid-1990s, Mearsheimer famously invested his reputation in the prediction that in the absence of a Soviet threat, Europe would descend once again into the internecine warfare of the pre-1945 era.  Around the same time, Walt predicted that in the absence of a Soviet threat, NATO would fall apart.  As you can see, the probelm with these bold predictions is that they ignored the difference between dictatorship and democracy. Getting back to China, I'm guessing that the same offensive-defensive divide that bifurcated realist approaches to the Soviet Union is also responsible for mixed opinions about China.  In addition, many realists have rushed to embrace the idea that democra tizing powers, as opposed to established democracies, are especially war prone.  When Itrack down Mearsheimer's latest on the Middle Kingdom, I'll let you know what he says. In conclusion, DN is right that Ishould tar every realist with the stain of Kissinger's Sinophilic accomodationism.  But the intellectual impulses responsible for Kissinger's short-sightness are endemic to the realist community.

As a committed realist, Kissinger desperately wants to believe that American foreign policy can be made without reference to the deeply-rooted ideals of democracy and human rights. And he's right; it can. From 1969 until 1976, the United States displayed almost no concern for democracy or human rights. Coincidentally, Kissinger served as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State from 1969 until 1976. (And the first president Kissinger worked for didn't even seem to be too concerned about subverting democracy within the United States.) In addition to being an ethical concern, democracy and human rights have a lot to do with national security.

The poverty is still breathtaking. The first time Iwas here, Inoticed an alarming number of children and elderly people without limbs begging on the street. After enquiry, Ilearned that families often lop a limb off one person to increase their begging prospects. One child's arm means food for the other six or seven children. The middle class is miniscule to the point of non-existence. Any Bangladeshi with money or connections almost invariably goes overseas, most to the Gulf, the UK or the US, sending remittances home and providing one of the main sources of income for the country. IT is the new buzz here, but it is unclear whether it actually exists besides one sad-looking internet cafe with two computers in the 'wealthy' part of town (read: less than abject poverty). Both times Iwent there was no current and hence no internet, but in theory you could check your email. Dhaka still does not have a McDonald's nor any other international chain, although it does have a Dominous pizza (note the ingenious way around copyright) and a restaurant that has stolen the Chili's logo and sells Thai food. The country has trouble attracting foreign investment because it has one of the highest corruption rates in the world, exacerbated by a political system run almost entirely by two political families who trade off power almost every election. During my visit, two strikes called by the opposition caused economic activity to grind to a halt. Fearing reprisals from the organized crime mobs controlled by each of the families, the entire country shuts down. When Iventured onto the streets around 2 p.m., the only activity Isaw on the usually congested streets was an occasional rickshaw. After several days in Dhaka, Itraveled by launch down the Ganges River to the island of Bhola, which served as my home for several months back in 2001. Things here have changed more dramatically, but Ifear for the worst. When Iwas here before, women did not adhere strictly to purdah and many ventured into the marketplace wearing only hijab. Now, women are largely kept to their homes and are required to wear a burkah in public. However, some advances have been made in women's health. Birth control in the form of contraceptive pills from India is now available, although apparently the local Madrassa has organized a campaign against its use (not that it seemed to be having much effect; most of the women see it as a Godsend). The island still only has a handful of doctors for 8 million people; education is spotty, although improving. Iwas glad to hear that in the past five years, families have begun to send their daughters to school past primary school. Ialso saw evidence that microfinance projects were living up to their touted potential here. Several women's craft guilds have appeared in the area since Ivisited last and many women appear to be supporting their families on the income they make. The biggest difference has to be the proliferation of cell phones and televisions. Before, the only telephone was owned by the police chief, who doled out phone privileges based on bribes or personal connections. Now, every third person seems to have a cell phone. The people in the area may still not have reliable electricity, or safe drinking water, or indoor plumbing, or much of anything else, but now many families do have a television. The children look just as malnourished but now they can sing Bollywood songs. Because of this, the people have a greater awareness of the outside world than they did four years ago. And the more they see of the outside world, the less likely Islamic extremism will make inroads in the area, something that it is constantly threatening to do. On the final night of my time in Bhola, Iwent up to the roof of the orphanage where Iwas staying and watched a storm roll in over the flat landscape. One of the teachers at the school gathered the children in a circle and sang a slow melodic folk song as the wind swept through the branches of the Khrishnachura trees below. When a lightening bolt would cascade across the sky, the red blossoms of the tree named for a god appeared against the night like tiny orbs of blazing fire. It was one of those moments of beauty and tranquility that, perhaps mistakenly, gives you faith in something that transcends the banalities and tragedies of this world. Bangladesh has a way of reminding you of the fragility of human life. Iknew that many people would die in the floods that would follow the storms.  The orphanage on which Istood was itself an artifact of the brutality of life here, built in the aftermath of the 1971 cyclone that killed millions in a matter of days. The moment on the roof was ethereal, but it was Iwho was the ghost, swooping in from another world to which Iwould shortly return. Most people here view the United States as akin to Paradise and equally unreachable in this life. Yet, life does goes on. Another child is born. Another dies of fever in the middle of the night. And another still is given a chance at making more of herself than the world ever intended. Im glad Ihave stayed involved in the community since Ileft, organizing a program that has given some young adults the chance at a university education and a better life. The misery of the people here is only matched by their potential to rise above it. Ilearned later that a launch similar to the one Ihad taken just days before capsized in the storm that night and 200 people died. The launch had capsized twice before, killing hundreds, and had been condemned by the river authorities. And yet, it had set out that night overcapacity and understaffed. Ironically, it was the first-class passengers who bore the brunt of the casualties. Trapped in their cabins when the boat capsized, they had no chance to swim ashore, while some of those on the open-air lower decks were permitted a fateful reprieve from death. As Ipaced nervously on the first-class deck the next night on my way back to Dhaka, afraid to retire to my cabin, Ireflected on the strange twists of fate that have left Bangladesh permanently on the lower deck in the world today. Hopefully, the boat won't have to capsize in order for them to someday reach the shore."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "(0) opinions -- Add your opinion"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "# Posted 12:19 PM by Patrick Belton"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "CALLING OUR ENGLISH READERS: If any of our friends may be able to spare a bit of time tomorrow afternoon, Ican bring a guest to the Garter Ceremony at Windsor Castle at 2 pm.

Representatives of Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR)’s Training Systems Program Office, PMA205, and Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA)’s Warfare Center Indian Head recently traveled to New Zealand to demonstrate the Integrated Maritime Portable Acoustic Scoring and Simulation (IMPASS) system to the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) and Royal Australian Navy (RAN). This new system was developed by PMA-205 to allow U.S. Navy Naval Surface Fire Support (NSFS) gun teams to conduct live-fire mission training with the Mk 45 gun system without the use of a land based range.  IMPASS operates completely independent of all ship systems, is easily adaptable, and supports other range activities such as developmental munitions scoring and bomb drop scoring for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Air Force. Each IMPASS system consists of a series of underwater acoustic sensors, which are built into floating buoys. These sensors are dispersed in a pattern in open water where they listen for the sounds of the guns projectile hitting the water following each gunshot. The buoys are designed to determine the direction from the buoy where the sound originated and then they triangulate the location of the impact with an accuracy of approximately ten meters.  Global-Positioning Satellites (GPS) provide precise positioning data of the buoys and firing platform.  Once detected, the impact data is transmitted to a system controller unit located on the support ship for tracking and display. The IMPASS system can be used in the open ocean and eliminates the transit to a fixed land range, saving steaming time and greatly reducing the cost of training.  For NSFS, a warship deploys the buoys and Expeditionary Warfare Training Group (EWTG) personnel then score the training exercise on-board providing an immediate assessment of the gunnery crew’s effectiveness. For the system demonstration, NAVAIR and NAVSEA arranged with the RNZN to provide a support ship and two warships, HMNZS Te Mana and HMNZS Te Kaha, to conduct a naval gunfire exercise.  The support ship deployed the five acoustic sensing buoys, and a base station was installed on the Te Mana.  The Te Kaha operated without any IMPASS equipment. While the U.S. Navy qualifies just one ship at a time, the RNZN desired to qualify multiple ships simultaneously and without the use of any IMPASS equipment on the firing platform.  “The RNZN preferred complete separation between the trainers and the gun team,” said Mark Berntsen, Ocean Systems Engineer, PMA-205.  “Asupport ship was used to deploy the buoy field, and calls for fire came from the IMPASS team operating on a separate warship from the firing platform, which provided the training realism their Navy desired.\"  In addition, the RNZN wanted to demonstrate that IMPASS could be operated exactly like a land range where a ship shows up on the gun line, fires and leaves. The morning of the demonstration, the IMPASS team, aboard the Te Mana, called in gunfire to the Te Mana gun team, who completed several firing sessions.  That afternoon, Te Kaha conducted its firing sessions into the buoy field.  The Te Kaha successfully completed its gunfire sessions using only the Spot Net to interface with the IMPASS team aboard the Te Mana.  \"Once again, IMPASS proved a highly valuable training tool for NSFS operations,” said Chris Hamann, Project Engineer, Naval Surface Warfare Center, Indian Head, Md.  “Conducting gunfire via a remote platform was a big departure from standard operating procedure for us, but the system's flexibility really impressed the RNZN officers.\" All of the five-inch rounds fired from both ships landed inside the buoy field and the system provided a log for each shot, suitable for scoring.  Completing all their objectives for the demonstration, the RNZN was able to fully appreciate the systems value.  \"Really, one of the best parts of IMPASS is the completely independent verification we provide of the ship's gun system.  When an operator has a problem at his console, we can tell immediately based on the gun team's response over the Spot Net,” said Lt. Cmdr. Scott Finlayson, Ocean Systems Program Manager, PMA-205.  “As the U.S. Navy has learned, it really forces the gun team to think through their processes.\" NAVAIR is awaiting a decision from the Royal New Zealand Navy to activate a Foreign Military Sales (FMS) case for purchase of the system. An observer from Australia was onboard the Te Mana to evaluate the system for the Royal Australian Navy.  Currently the Royal Australian Navy is in the process of requesting a demonstration using their warships. Photo cutline: Front row left to right: Paul Gilkison, Air Affairs, Lt. Cmdr.

But we found that\nour daughter's skin responded best to the dye- and perfume-free mainstream\ndetergent (All or Arm & Hammer, etc.). Everything else, including all the\nexpensive guilt-marketed baby stuff, gave her a rash. \nLaura Laundry soap for babies: For my own and my daughter's clothes, Iuse plain\nold unscented Trader Joe's laundry detergent. It's cheap and concentrated\nso a box or bottle (comes in powder or liquid) lasts a long time. I'm\nallergic to almost all scents in brand-name products, and the smell of\ntalcum powder literally makes me gag and gives me a headache, so Iavoid\nmost \"baby\" products. The clothes come out smelling and looking fine to me,\nand when time and weather permit, Idry them on the line outside rather\nthan in the dryer, and then they smell super, though they might not be as soft.\nNicole Inever did my baby's laundry separately, but I've always used Dye-Free,\nperfume-free detergent for my own sensitive skin.  It seems to work just\nfine, and Ihaven't ever done a second rinse.\nDawn We have used Tide Free with for our child's clothes since she was born.\n(She is now almost 20 months old). We wash all of the family's clothes\ntogether, and have not had a problem with this method. Good luck, Gail\nGail Ido a separate load of baby clothes, sheets, towels, etc. every week,\nall colors and fabrics together, with Dreft and warm water, and it has\nworked out fine.  My son does not have problems with his skin, so Iprobably could use scent- and dye-free Tide or the like, but have not as\nyet.  Such products are very harsh, however, so Iwould want to do at\nleast one *warm* rinse.  The other detergent we have used, both for\nourselves and the kid, is an environmentally friendly liquid laundry\nproduct, Ecover, that we get at Whole Foods or the Berkeley Bowl.  It\ncomes in several sizes, including a biggish plastic bottle, and is fine\nfor baby clothes.  It is not a particularly \"budget\" product, however.\nIprefer to do the kid's wash separately, so that Ican better control\nwhat he's exposed to, and it's not a problem to collect one load over\nthe course of 4-7 days.  As to dryer sheets and fabric softeners - Ithink those are a big waste of money and that you'd be better served\nbuying the milder soap or detergent.  Have fun. \nWendy Many babies are sensetive to the perfume and dyes in detergents.\nBelieve it or not, Dreft has fragrance and even though some babies are\nok with that, our pediatric dermetologist recommended All Free and\nClear as a better option.  Absoutely NO FABRIC SOFTNER OR DRYER SHEET.\nEven adults should really not use them if they have any sensetivities.\nIwas allergic to them though Idid not find that out till this year.\nSuddenly all my allergies disappered when Istopped using them.\nDowney makes a \"downey free\" but why bother??  If you want to talk\nsome more, email me.\nGlosson About washing baby clothes:  I've been washing all of my daughter's (9 1/2\nmos) clothes with regular detergent (Tide, usually) since she was born.  Idid one load after she got home with Tide and tried the clothes on her,\nkeeping an eye out for reactions, and had no problem.  This has worked for\npretty much all of the other moms that Iknow.  I'd say give it a shot\nbefore going out and investing in all the special detergents.  At least\nthat way, if you do have to use them, you'll know it's because that's what\nyour baby needs.  Good luck!\njocelyn Regarding detergent and baby clothes.\nNot all babies have sensitive skin.  Ihave always washed both my kids\nclothes with our clothes and with our regular detergent, Arm and Hammer\nscent free, and it has never been a problem.  We don't use any fabric\nsofteners though.  But some of my friends babies skin are more sensitive,\nand they use special detergent.  Hopefully you won't have to.\nLiz Ihave had no problems washing my baby's clothes with perfume-free, dye-free\ndetergents; All, Tide, and Arm and Hammer all work, without even an extra\nrinse cycle. (Idon't use much soap, since it's not as tough the clothes\nhave ground-in dirt or anything.) She's five months old now, and we've been\ndoing this since she was bornwith no sign of any allergic reaction. Your\nbaby's skin may be more prone to irritation, but otherwise Isee no reason\nto spend the extra money on Dreft etc.\nCouldn't tell you about fabric softeners and dryer sheets, though, 'cause Idon't use either.\nJennifer One more point about fabric softeners that wasn't made by responders so\nfar--the allergy doctor at Kaiser who treats my toddler for excema pointed\nthat IF Ichoose to use a fabric softener, it should be the kind Iput in\nthe washing machine, not the sheets one adds to the clothes in the dryer,\nwhich work by coating the clothes (with a wax, Ithink) and is definitely\ngoing to contact the skin, even if it is scent-free.  The fabric softener in\nthe washer is less likely to be right on the surface of the cloth in contact\nwith skin--it either penetrates into the fibers or is rinsed out or\nboth--can't remember that part of the explanation.\nsally We were both grad students when our son (almost 3) was born, and we\ndidn't have time to do separate laundry, so Idecided to use the\nall free (perfume-free, dye-free (unfortunately not also expense\nfree!)) soap and it worked great."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Be sure to wash all new clothes before the baby wears them too.\nIwas happy that this worked since several people in my family\nhave severe skin allergies, so Iwas on the look-out for any\nadverse reaction.\nHeather"}]}

Our situation seemed identical to yours: we do \nnot co-sleep with her.  The first thing we did was adjusted her \nschedule of napping, so that there was more time between naps.  \nWe found that being consistant and sticking to our routine has \nhelped a lot.  When we put her down, we go through our little \nroutine and we lay her down in her crib and leave the room.  \nAfter five minutes, if she is crying (and usually standing up) \nwe check on her and lay her back down, rub her head a couple \ntimes, but do not say anything and do not pick her up or hold \nher.  She would usually get back up and cry. We wait longer (7-\n10 minutes) before we go in and lay her back down.  We repeat \nthe process and extend the time between going in the room.  The \nfirst week was hard.  It would take about an hour just to get \nher to sleep.  We are first time parents and she is not a fussy \nbaby, so hearing her cry just broke our hearts.   It has taken \nabout a month but now when we put her down, if she gets up and \ncries, we usually have to lay her back down once and she falls \nasleep.  Ihope this helps.  It has really helped us a lot.\nAmy Oh Boy, Iremember this all too well.  Let me see, where to \nbegin?  Well, my daughter who is now 12 is and was the same, \nspirited, intelligent, commanding and demanding!  And Igave in \nevery time.  Why?  Because Idid not believe in the ''books'' \nadvice that if you just ignore it the infant/toddler will stop \nand just go to sleep on their own after say a week.. Iactually \ntested this out, at 3 months, at 6, 9, 1 year, 3, years, 5 years, \n8 years.  Perhaps you are wondering if Ihad incompleter \nboundaries or a soft heart.  Yes to a soft heart, Ilove my child \nmore than myself but Idesperately wanted sleep.  Ican not begin \nto list all the night lights, snuggles, book reading, vampire \nsalts, etc. we went through!  None worked for us.  Irecomend \nreading ''Raisng your spirited child'' right away, it was a great \nhelp to me to know that there are lot's of children out there who \nhave this temperant and viewed in the right way, it is a gift to \nthe holder of the personality.  My daughter and Iwere able to \nsleep by me getting a queen size bed and Islept there with her \nin her room for 10 years!  Itried everything else, including at \n5 trying to lock her in her room out of desperation to sleep with \nmy husband who was admantly against co sleeping.  She is still \nintense and keenly aware and always will be.  This poses certain \nhuge hurdles of growth on my part but Isee her blossoming into a \ncreative, vibrant, self sufficent young teen.  Artistic and \ncaring. Iwouldn't trade her for anything!!\nIthink you got the best of the bunch, just give in to the \ndemands of the personality, after all this is why we are mothers, \nno matter how hard and believe me, there were many nights when Isat by her bed and cried myself to sleep before Igot the \nmatteress.\nmscwalker What we did was practice getting from a standing to a sitting \nposition through play.  Iwould hold my baby's hands and pull \nher up saying ''baby UP'', then I'd lower her onto her little \nbooty saying ''baby DOWN''.  We started when she was about 4 \nmonths old, but I'm sure you can do it with an 8-month old.  Idid this specifically so that she wouldn't get stuck in a \nstanding position in her crib at night and causing problems with \nher putting herself back to sleep.  Fortunately, Iread \na ''getting your baby to sleep'' book that alerted me to the \nproblem before it began.\nChristina There have been times when my son was exhausted and \nresisting sleep, so Iput him in the crib to fall asleep, \nalthough it upset him (and me).  The nice thing about a crib \nis that it's designed to be safe.  He fell asleep standing up, \nleaning on the bars, more than once, after crying for a while.  \nWhen he fell down, he did not hurt himself, and it only \nawakened him slightly--then he went back to a deeper sleep \n(Iwatched him do this once).  Other times he was practically \nasleep standing up (after crying for a while), and did not get \nup again when we lay him down.  My son has gone through \nseveral different stages in his falling-asleep habits, some of \nthem quite brief, so don't despair!  He is now 18 months old, \nand rarely complains when put to bed, tired but awake, for a \ndaytime nap or a night's sleep.  And in our case it was \ncertainly true that the first 2 or 3 times of crying to sleep were \nthe most painful for all parties.  After that, when we had to do \nit (he was frequently asleep when put into bed, Iadmit), he \noften only cried for 5 or 10 minutes (often intermittently).  \nSince your daughter is easily disturbed by noises, you might \nwant to try using some soothing music that will mask \nnoises from outside her room (your footsteps, etc.), that \nmight keep her from relaxing into sleep, at bedtime--start it \nbefore you leave, and leave it playing when you go.  We have \nbeen using the same music for many months as part of the \nbedtime routine, and Istarted using it for naptime, too, more \nrecently--it's definitely helpful.  And if the teething is keeping \nher from sleeping, you might want to try Tylenol, in the \ndosage recommended by your pediatrician, on nights when \nit's really bothering her.  Iwas worried (about starting a \nhabit, Iguess) the first time Idid this, but found that Ionly \nended up using it a few times.\nLisa We worked with a very intuitive baby coach ...

What is the income of a coal miner, copper miner, or oil producer,\nwho may sell coal, ore, or crude oil but in the process the mines or wells\nslowly become exhausted? Are they entitled to deduct from their gross revenue\nsome part for this depletion, the same way that an automobile dealer deducts\nthe amount he paid the factory for your new car before he sold it to you? One definition that economists like to use for income is the change\nin your wealth from one point in time to another.  Of course, this idea is\njust as fuzzy as the original notion, because nobody can define \"wealth\"\nin any clear way.  Is it the market value of all your property?  Does it\ninclude the stored-up potential value of your training and education?  Is\nyour native intelligence — or the guidance from your parents that helped\nyou develop good attitudes toward work — a part of your \"wealth\"? The problem of attempting to measure income is one of the main defects\nin an income tax.  Of course, the Internal Revenue Service loves this particular\ndefect, because it can make all kinds of complex and obscure rules to audit\nthe traveling salesman, the mom-and-pop grocery, and the coal miner.  Farmers\nhave a really good thing going for them.  Most farmers can hide the distinction\nbetween family consumption and business expenses without even thinking about\nit.  The I.R.S. has an entire special set of rules to audit farmers, most\nof whom don't have \"income\" at all. If you try to picture someone's \"income\" as a river that is flowing\nacross his property, you can see the analogy with the weekly paycheck.  The\nriver might flow at a rate of a thousand gallons per hour.  Your paycheck\nmight arrive at the rate of $300.00 per week.  The income tax, however, is\nimposed on your annual income.  The process of taking something that flows\nover time and lumping it into a fixed total at the end of a period of time\nis a major defect in the income tax.  Should the tax be the same on someone\nwho earns $300.00 per week for 52 weeks as for someone who only works for\n13 weeks in the summer at $1200.00 per week and spends the winter on a Caribbean\nisland? Their annual incomes are the same. Many people believe that a person's \"income\" is somehow related\nto his standard of living.  The argument is that \"equity\" requires that people\nwho have a higher standard of living should pay more in taxes than people\nwho have a lower standard of living.  Take two people, however, who receive\nan equal amount of money on January 1st.  Assume that one of them goes to\nLas Vegas and has a jolly good time eating and drinking, losing all his money\nat the tables, and enjoying live entertainment.  Assume the second person\ntakes the same amount of money and builds a school for orphans. Aside from the fact that both started with the same amount of cash,\nand each chose to spend it voluntarily in different ways, what kind of argument\ncan pretend that their standard of living is the same?  Perhaps the benefactor\nof the orphans was a lonely old woman who lives in a one-room apartment with\nthree cats.  Perhaps the high-roller in Las Vegas is a blue-collar worker,\ndying of cancer, who took his entire pension benefit in a lump sum to enjoy\nit before he dies. It is irrational to attempt to \"measure\" the amount people should\npay in taxes according to sociological criteria.  People who regularly put\nlarge amounts of their \"income\" or \"wealth\" into savings and investments\nhelp to create jobs and furnish modern tools and technology to workers, who\nthen become more productive and earn higher wages.  How does the concept\nof \"income\" or \"wealth\" fit the model of the high-roller in Las Vegas and\nthe lonely old woman, who might in fact be a millionaire's widow?

People with savings\nto invest who don't want the risks of starting their own business may invest\nin the financial markets, or the financial institutions; but any interest\nor dividends earned are reduced annually by the income tax, so they can't\nkeep reinvesting to accumulate capital.  Ask any accountant about compound\ninterest:  the difference is dramatic when you see the comparison between\na tax-free investment and an investment with yearly taxes deducted! On the other hand, some of America's upper-class or aristocratic\nfamilies, whose grandfathers built their fortunes in the days before there\nwas an income tax, enjoy a standard of living that our hypothetical young\nman could achieve only with a lot of lucky breaks and hard work.

The different tax rates for different amounts of \"income\" are also\nthe fundamental reason why the tax code is so complex that most people need\nhelp to prepare their tax returns.

Each individual strives to become wealthy \"intending\nonly his own gain\" but to this end he must exchange what he\nowns or produces with others who sufficiently value what he has\nto offer; in this way, by division of labour and a free market,\npublic interest is advanced. Smith is often regarded as the father of economics, and his writings\nhave been enormously influential. Nowadays, \"invisible hand\" explanations\nare invoked to explain all sorts of phenomena, from scientific progress\nto environmental degradation. In the modern context, mathematicians\nstudy \"invisible hand\" processes as part of Game Theory, the branch of\nmathematics that deals with payoffs and strategies (see Game\nTheory and the Cuban Missile Crisis )\nin Issue 13 of Plus . Smith was profoundly religious, and saw the\n\"invisible hand\" as the mechanism by which a benevolent God\nadministered a universe in which human happiness was\nmaximised. He made it clear in his writings that quite\nconsiderable structure was required in society before the \ninvisible hand mechanism could work efficiently. For example,\nproperty rights must be strong, and there must be widespread\nadherence to moral norms, such as prohibitions against theft and\nmisrepresentation. Theft was, to Smith, the worst crime of all,\neven though a poor man stealing from a rich man may increase\noverall happiness.\nHe even went so far as to say that the purpose of government\nis to defend the rich from the poor. Here is a description of the way Smith imagined the universe operates:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "There is a benevolent deity who administers the world in such\na way as to maximise human happiness. In order to do this he has created humans with a nature\nthat leads them to act in a certain way. The world as we know it is pretty much perfect, and everyone is \nabout equally happy. In particular, the rich are no happier than the poor. Although this means we should all be happy with our lot in life,\nour nature (which, remember, was created by God for the purpose\nof maximising happiness) leads us to think that we would be\nhappier if we were wealthier. This is a good thing, because it leads us to struggle to become \nwealthier, thus increasing the sum total of human happiness via\nthe mechanisms of exchange and division of labour."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "It is clear why Smith says that moral norms are necessary for such\na system to work - in order for exchange to proceed, \ncontracts must be enforceable, people must have good\naccess to information about the products and services\navailable, and the rule of law must hold."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "The modern \"Invisible Hand\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nowadays, something much more general is meant by the expression\n\"invisible hand\". An invisible hand process is one in which\nthe outcome to be explained is produced in a decentralised way,\nwith no explicit agreements between the\nacting agents. The second essential\ncomponent is that the process is not intentional. The agents' aims\nare not coordinated nor identical with the actual outcome, which is\na byproduct of those aims. The process should work even\nwithout the agents having any knowledge of it. This is why the process\nis called invisible. The system in which the invisible hand is most often assumed\nto work is the free market. \nAdam Smith assumed that consumers choose for the lowest price,\nand that entrepreneurs choose for the highest rate of profit.\nHe asserted that by thus making their excess or insufficient demand known through\nmarket prices, consumers \"directed\" entrepreneurs' investment money to\nthe most profitable industry. Remember that this is the industry \nproducing the goods most highly\nvalued by consumers, so in general economic well-being is increased. One extremely positive aspect of a market-based\neconomy is that it forces people to think about what\nother people want. Smith saw this as a large part of\nwhat was good about the invisible hand mechanism.\nHe identified two ways to obtain\nthe help and co-operation of other people, upon which we all depend constantly.\nThe first way is to appeal to the benevolence and goodwill of others. \nTo do this a person must often act in a servile and fawning way, which Smith\nfound repulsive, and he claimed it generally meets\nwith very limited success. The second way is to\nappeal instead to other people's self-interest. In one of his most famous quotes:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his\nbrethren, and it is in vain for him to expect it from their\nbenevolence only.

Obviously, both parties \nare better off if neither default\nthan if both default - after all, we suppose they \nwillingly contracted with each\nother - but each would like to get\nsomething for nothing, and each is\nafraid the other will feel the same. The result may well be\nthat the parties are unable to carry out the exchange\nas arranged, and both lose out. The reason we don't see this behaviour too often is because we live in a \nsociety where courts can enforce contracts.

Enforcing laws of contract requires cooperation and resources from someone \nelse - in democratic societies, the\ncourts on behalf of the government and the people. \nBut courts and prisons and police \ncost money and most\nof the costs fall on people who were not party \nto the contract in the first place -\nwho are therefore paying for a service that doesn't \ndirectly benefit themselves.\nSuch courts fall into the category of \"public good\" - \nwe are all better off in a society\nwhere the rule of law is upheld - but are not created and maintained \nby any invisible hand mechanism.\nCourts are set up deliberately to carry out a public good; \nand, although they may not always work\nthe way they are intended to, there is nothing \nunintended about their use to enforce\ncontracts."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Subsidy-seeking"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a democratic society, there is a strong temptation\nfor \"special-interest\" groups to form and lobby the \ngovernment to provide tax-payers'\nmoney to the group in the form of subsidies. \nPoliticians find the prospect of buying the loyalty of the\ngroup attractive, and the group sees the prospect\nof getting other people's money for nothing. \nClearly, everyone\nwould be better off if no one sought subsidies - by definition,\nsubsidies are only needed for unprofitable activities, that is,\nactivities that other people do not value sufficiently\nto pay their own money for. However,\nif other people seek and gain subsidies, anyone who doesn't\nbother trying to do the same for themselves\nwill end up subsidising others while receiving no subsidies\nthemselves. This fear may force large numbers of people\nto spend their time lobbying the government \nfor subsidies, rather than\nsimply engaging in more profitable activities - a classic example\nof the\nPrisoner's Dilemma, and one over which no court has jurisdiction. Avery similar situation occurs regarding monopolies.\nSince pretty much every producer is a consumer, it is probably to \neverybody's benefit overall if no producers attempt to raise prices by \nmonopolising their market; however, attempting to enforce a monopoly can be very\nattractive to individual producers.

An economic version of the flip-flop could occur if a majority\nof customers would prefer to buy Product Xto Product Y,\nbut some of that majority actually\nlike Product Zeven better (the equivalent of splitting the vote); \nthe producer may end up producing\nProduct Yeven though more people would have liked Product X,\nand presumably it would have been more profitable to produce it.\nIf this happens, then the invisible hand cannot be said to have \nworked to maximise economic wellbeing.

{"file_number": "143", "plaintext": [{"tag": "div", "text": "CLASSROOM\nOUTREACH GENERAL OVERVIEW  2006-2007: This is our 15th year doing outreach around the State of Oregon and\noccasionally\ninto Washington and California.  We visit approximately 300\nclassrooms\neach school year, fairly evenly distributed in grade levels. LOGISTICS OF OUTREACH SESSIONS: (contents in next section) General Info:  I'm (Rick Kang) probably the person that will come\nto\nyour classroom.  The program is a collaborative extension of\nUniversity\nof Oregon's Professor Greg Bothun's \"Electronic Universe\" project (see http://zebu.uoregon.edu ). We may have other outreach instructors available during the year,\nparticularly\nin the Portland and Central Oregon areas.  We create specific\nsessions\nfor each class, grade appropriate, and addressing specific topics you\nwant\ncovered. The program fits into many areas of science curriculum FOR ALL GRADE\nLEVELS\nINCLUDING EARLY ELEMENTARY.  Content tie-ins can be forces,\nmotion,\ncycles, electricity, matter and energy, radiation/waves, general\nphysical\nscience, and some areas of geology, meteorology, and ecology. \nWithin\na specific Earth Science/Astronomy program, the Electronic Universe can\nserve\nwell as an introduction to how we probe deep space as well as answering\nstudents'\nquestions later on and providing a capstone conclusional activity such\nas\none of our digital labs (see below for details). The overall program is called the Electronic Universe because we use\nand\npresent a lot of electronics and digital technology.  We feature\nthree\nmajor digital items: Professor Bothun's new JAVA (interactive\nweb-based)\nvirtual physics labs/demos, projects using a CCD (digital camera), and\nOregon\nResearch Institute's new Sun-Earth-Moon virtual reality software. Ilike at least 60-90 minutes, but we can do a 30-45 minute session or\nmultiple\nsessions.  Idon't mind doing several repeat sessions during a\nday. \nMinimally, Ibring a laptop and LCD projector, so the room needs to\nhave\na screen, be darkenable, and have a table for the projector and\ncomputer. \nIf we are doing any of the technology pieces, then Ibring in a\nportable\nCCD Camera and/or a small Telescope.  If we are doing basic Solar\nSystem/Sun-Earth-Moon,\nwe may do some activities outdoors (scale models, and solar viewing). For the technology/measuring the sky program, there is extensive\nhardware\nsetup, about 30 minutes, and also similar take-down time, and several\nboxes\nof gear to transport, so placing me in one location and rotating\nclasses\nin works best.  Since we do a lot of \"hands-on\" activities,\nclasses\nshould be under 30 students.  We have found that \"assemblies\"\ndon't\nwork for our main inquiry-based type of program.   If you'd\nlike\na show-and-tell or pictureshow type of general program for an assembly,\nthat\ncan be arranged, but our program is primarily an inquiry-based\nintroduction\nto the science of astrophysics, with a lot of participatory activities. My schedule can get booked full particularly in the Spring, so please\ncontact\nme several weeks in advance if possible. Costwise, this year (2005)we are requesting between $10 and $100 per\nschool, regardless of number\nof classes done, on a sliding scale, generally proportionate to the\nnumber of classes done but with consideration of available school\nbudget. (Example: 1 small class would be $10, a small “assembly” or\nmorning’s worth of individual classes might be $30, a multi-day\npresentation to six classes would approach $100.)  This amount\ngoes to Friends of Pine Mountain Observatory, not to the instructor,\nand  is used to offset our overhead costs, primarily the\nproduction/distribution of the prep video, curriculum materials, and\nhardware usage.  NASA's Oregon Space Grant currently covers\ninstructor cost and travel costs for trips throughout western\nOregon.  For extended distant trips, we may request some\nadditional funding to help cover the travel expenses.  Visiting\nmultiple destinations during one trip will help share costs. CONTENTS OF OUTREACH CLASS SESSIONS: Variety of programs for ALL grade levels: The basic presentation covers how students at any grade level can do\nreal\nscience with the Sky by making observations and measurements.  For\ngrade\n4 and higher we provide an introduction to how data can be collected\ndigitally,\nand how digital data can be measured and put to use.  We generally\ndon't\npresent historical narratives, collections of statistics, nor cover\nconstellation\ninformation or lore (we can point you to resources for these topics). Prep session, prior to outreach, is very important, particularly to\nclarify\nvocabulary of objects and vastness of space.  See below for\nsuggested\ntopics, and about the new free prep video. Basic Theme: Surveying the Sky:  If we examine the sky with our\neyes,\nwith a telescope, or with a camera, what do we see? Can we characterize and classify objects by making observations? Sorting out objects by apparent size and brightness. Observing change in appearance and position over time. Arranging our data to use the data to draw rational conclusions. Making models to explain our observations. What are \"physical characteristics\" of objects/phenomena? Can we measure such characteristics of very distant objects? We are concerned with the inquiry-based process of scientific research,\nnot\nwith \"factoids\".  Our program stays away from \"factoids\" and does\nnot\ndeal with topics such as constellation lore/history (although these\ntopics\nare excellent cross-curriculum content!)  Often we deal with\nquestions\nthat do not have a \"right answer\" nor even any answer at this time. We encourage students to collect and evaluate data. Integrated with the above investigative strategies, here are some of\nthe\nspecific content areas that we can work with your students to explore: a. Introduction to the Solar System: \nSun-Earth-Moon\nand beyond:  We can address motions/views of Sun-Earth-Moon and\nSolar\nSystem, using kinesthetic models, a new dynamic virtual reality\ngraphical\nmodel, scale models, and lots of images from various professional\nsources. \nWhy are planets and stars spherical?  Why do they rotate? \nWhy\ndo the planets orbit the Sun in a plane?  Why do we see the Moon\nand\ncertain planets only at certain times?  This program is suitable\nfor\nearly elementary, and can be adapted for higher grades where students\nneed\ninformation for the Common Curriculum Goals Earth-in-Space Benchmarks. b. Introduction to Technologies to Explore Deep Space: How we know what we know about very distant objects/phenomena: We bring a small Telescope plus a portable CCD Camera that students can\nuse\nto explore how distant light is collected and detected, and how digital\nimages\ncan be enhanced and measured.  What are the two basic\nmeasurements? \nWhat can these measurements tell us about characteristics of distant\nobjects? \nThis material is very suitable for grades 4-12 and portions can be\nadapted\nfor early elementary. We also use a variety of high tech JAVA based interactive graphical\n\"applets\"\ndeveloped by Professor Greg Bothun at Uof Oto illustrate various\nprinciples\nof physics and astrophysics such as production of photons, production\nof\nthermal spectrum, and nature of detectors. Greg and ORI are both developing new virtual lab activities and we'll\nshowcase\nthese as they become available. c. Computer Labs: Two years ago we commenced this\nactivity,\nsix schools, from grades 3-12 were successful.  We preload free\nFITSVIEW\nimage analysis software plus a series of images to analyze.  \nThere\nare four pairs of images taken one night apart, that have one of the\nfour\nouter planets (Saturn-Pluto) in each pair of images.  The job of\nthe\nstudents is to find the planet in each pair of images and then to\nidentify\nwhich planet by measuring relative shift from night to night and also\ncomparing\nbrightness. We do this as a follow-up to the in-class session described\nin\npart b, above.  If your school has a Windows or Mac lab, you can\nparticipate. d. Overview of the Cassini-Hugens Mission to Saturn\nand\nTitan:  Apowerpoint presentation covering overview of mission,\nspacecraft,\nflight, scientific goals, and showing current images sent back from\nSaturn\nand its Moons.  This program will work for larger\ngroups/assemblies. \nWe do some scale model activities but primarily focus on the\ninformation\nand pictures supplied by NASA and JPL.  We furnish teachers with a\nsummary\nhandout sheet including URLs. WORKSHEETS and EVALUATION SHEETS: Most teachers have requested use of worksheets for classes at 5th grade\nlevel\nand higher.  We normally bring a fill-in-the-blank style worksheet\nfor\nduplication and distribution at start of class. We can send the master to you ahead of time if you wish to print it\nbeforehand. Sometimes we encourage students to use a blank piece of paper and then\nwe\nmake notes together on a projected window from the laptop. We supply a key for the teacher for use in review after the class. We also bring a page for students with a few questions to fill out for\nfeedback\nfor us on how the classes can be improved, and we supply teachers with\na\nmore detailed questionaire.  These surveys can be mailed back to\nme\nand are usually done for homework or the next day, as our sessions\nusually\nrun the whole class period. PREP VIDEO Tom Cleveland, of Think Video/Lane Community Cable Television, and I,\nhave\nput together a 28-minute introductory video for use prior to the\noutreach\nsessions, or as a stand-alone INTRODUCTION to EXPLORING DEEP\nSPACE. \nThe material is suitable for ALL grade levels, but particularly\nsuitable\nfor Elementary and Middle School.  We start with a brief\nintroduction\nto the emptiness of space by taking an imaginary flight upward from\nEarth,\nnoting the results and requirements of leaving the atmosphere and\nrunning\nout of air. Next we cover, using models, the vocabulary of Moon, Planet, Star/Sun,\nSolar\nSystem, Nebula, Galaxy, and Universe.  Then we create a scale\nmodel\nof the Solar System and beyond on a real football field, an activity\nyou\ncan duplicate. Finally we explore the basic concepts of light, introducing viewers to\nthe\nterm \"photons\", and noting that to \"see\" anything we need a source of\nphotons\nand a detector of photons (stars and our eyes).  We tie the whole\nprogram\ntogether with a final demonstration with a flashlight to show how\nphotons\nfrom a distant source spread out, thus why objects in deep space are so\ndim,\nso hard to explore. The actual classroom outreach program then gives the students the\nopportunities\nto explore the collection/detection/measuring technologies (telescopes\nand\nCCD cameras) and includes computer labs where actual research can be\ndone. When you contact me to schedule your outreach session, I'll mail you a\nprep\nvideo along with several worksheets and answer keys to complement the\nvideo. \nI'll pick up the video when Icome to your classroom.  There is no\ncost\nfor the video, but we do need it returned. Responses have been very positive from Elementary and Middle\nSchoolers. \nMost High School students have felt that the video was too simplistic\nfor\nthem, although some have commented that the concepts/overview have been\nvery\nhelpful. Our major concern is that students have the overview of vast distances,\nhierarchy/vocabulary\nof types of objects, and initial exposure to concept of photons for the\ntechnology\nprogram, as we don't have time within the class to cover these\ntopics. \nFor example, the students should understand the difference between a\nSolar\nSystem and a Galaxy, functionally, in appearance, and in scale. If you don't wish to go this route or don't have enough time to get the\nvideo\nmailed to you, Ican attach a basic vocabulary/distance scales info\nsheet\nto an e-mail message to you, or you can find this document at the\nFriends\nof PMO web site. We will also be creating a video that demonstrates the use of FITSVIEW\nand\nAIP4WIN image analysis software.  This will be distributed as\nfollow-up\nmaterials for students interested in pursuing a research project using\ndigital\nimages of the sky. SOLAR VIEWING: We now have a standard solar filter for the 6\" telescope that Ibring\nto\nclassrooms, so if the sky is clear, there is potentially the\nopportunity\nto view sunspots.  We can set up the telescope outside before or\nafter\nclass or during lunch or recess.  This is not an H-alpha filter\nlike\nwe have at Pine Mountain that shows the solar prominences, but the\nstandard\nfilter still offers very interesting views of the solar \"surface\"\nfeatures. \nQueing up to view through the telescope takes time, so this usually\ndoesn't\nwork well during a class period as too many students are left idle, but\nis\ncertainly suitable as a supplemental before/after class/school activity. REQUESTS FOR SKY VIEWING IN EVENING: Occasionally schools request an evening sky observing program in\nconjunction\nwith the classroom outreach.  This may be feasible, working with\nyour\nlocal Astronomy Club/Astronomical Society, or with any other local\npeople\nwho can bring large telescopes.  We can set up the portable CCD\nCamera\non a table outside, and students have a great time taking actual images\nof\nsome of the larger objects in the sky, such as galaxies, star clusters,\nand\nnebulas.  We can discuss the arrangements for each request\nspecifically,\nas resources vary considerably around the State. VIRTUAL REALITY (VR) Sun-Earth-Moon (SEM) project: Oregon Research Institute (ORI), in Eugene, has created a VR program\nwhere\nthe user can \"fly\" his/her craft around, above, and below the Sun,\nEarth,\nand Moon (other planets may be added later).  The goal is for the\nuser\nto conceptualize the motions, orientations, and views of these objects\nby\nbeing able to gain a wide variety of physical perspectives not normally\navailable. \nExplorations include phases of the Moon and the orbits and periods of\nthe\nEarth and Moon and their relationships to the position of the\nSun. \nThis program, called SEM, is funded by the Federal Department of\nEducation. \nORI Prime Investigator, Dr. Dean Inman, wrote the grant as a program\ndesigned\nto help Orthopedically Impaired (OI) students do science labs that they\nordinarily\nwould not be able to access. When Isaw the software in early Summer, 2002, Iwas immediately struck\nthat\nnon-OI students should also be able to put these explorations to good\nuse,\nand also noted that the software serves to illustrate many of the ODE's\nEarth-in-Space\nbenchmarks. Iam now working with ORI to develop teacher and student materials for\nuse\nof the SEM program, and will be introducing SEM in many of my outreach\nclasses. \nDr. Inman and Iwill be looking for teachers who are interested in\ncollaborating\nto investigate the efficacy of SEM, comparing how students learn with\nconventional\nstrategies versus SEM, for both OI and regular students. The software is free and is available either as a download off the web\nfrom http://www.ori.org/%7Evr/projects/vrscience/sem/index.html or from a CD-ROM\nthat ORI can send you.   Fed Ed has also funded availability\nof\nhigh video performance computers from ORI for classrooms wishing to\nparticipate. \nPlease contact me if you are interested in participating, whether or\nnot\nyou have OI students. RESEARCH PROJECTS: Inquiry-based RESEARCH\nPROJECTS for ALL GRADE LEVELS: Digital data can be used by students of all ages.  Here are some\nsuggested\nprojects that we can assist you to implement in your classroom. \nDepending\non student academic levels, you could use/adapt several projects at a\nwide\nvariety of grade levels. The projects can begin as inquiries after viewing some initial digital\nimages\nof the sky (or viewing the real sky for that matter!)  If you come\nup\nwith your own project, we can assist you with data and data analysis\nsoftware. \nWe can demonstrate a basic project listed below during outreach and can\nthen\nwalk your students through the project in your computer lab. a. How many stars (how many galaxies)? Starting from a rudimentary counting exercise, students can explore\nimages\nfrom various areas of the sky and images taken with a variety of\nexposure\ntimes.  Questions can be generated concerning distribution of\nobjects,\ntypes of objects, and how much of what's out there we are really able\nto\nsee, why and why not.  This is a very open-ended project that can\nbe\na real eye-opener to the vastness of space and the nature of how\nscience\nis done and is very suitable for lower elementary grade levels. b. Do any objects shift position in the sky? This involves astrometric (positional) measurements, over a period of\ntime. \nStarting by \"blinking\" (comparing) images of the same area of sky over\none\nor more nights, students can search for objects that shift relative\nposition\nand then attempt to explain the shift observed.  Students can\nderive\nthe basic relationship between distance and parallactic shift and thus\nsort\nout Solar System objects versus Galactic objects, discover asteroids,\nand\ncan begin to sort out the various planets at various distances and\napproximate\nthe orbital radii. See the astrometric project, initiated by Silverton High School\nTeacher,\nRay Kaser, described as the computer lab option in the Contents of\nOutreach\nSessions section above. Another astrometric project involves the search for asteroids. \nThis\nis an authentic research project with potentially very useful results\n(saving\nEarth!).  Students can request data or can scan archived\ndata. \nBest done with Richard Berry's AIP4WIN image analysis software, which\nwhen\ncombined with a digital database, will allow the user to accurately\ndetermine\ncoordinates of any candidates.  Data can then be compared with\nlist\nof known objects compiled by Lowell Observatory, and if object is truly\na\nnew discovery, the discoverer may participate in the naming of the\nobject. c. Why are some objects brighter than others? This involves photometric (brightness) measurements and leads to\nmeasurement\nof distances, temperatures, sizes, and brings up issues of instrument\ncalibration. \nAt the basic level, students can intuitively conceptualize the\nrelationships\nand can begin to characterize and classify objects in the sky. We have archived sets of data of stars of several constellations, which\ncan\nbe measured for relative brightnesses. At more advanced levels, we can furnish images filtered in various\ncolors\n(BVR) which would lead to measurement of temperature from the Planck\nBlackbody\nCurve and ultimately to construction of an H-Rdiagram and determining\nstellar\nage. REQUEST or DOWNLOAD DATA (IMAGES of the SKY): Archived data can be \"FTPd\" (we like WS_FTP software to do this) or\n\"Timbuktud\"\n(Timbuktu software from www.netopia.com) from IP 128.223.164.30 . Contact Rick ( rkang@efn.org ) for\nuser name/password. Also contact Rick if you want to acquire new data either from our\nCOWCAM\n(1/2 degree FOV, BVR filters available, 1Kx1K pixel CCD, 5 Meg FITS format images) or from our PIGGY (1 degree FOV,\nno\nfilters, 242x375 pixel CCD, 300 KB FITS format images), we may be able\nso\nset up remote imaging sessions for you. We encourage you to select suitable targets and to furnish us with the\nidentity,\nRA/DEC, and desired integration time and filters for your\ntargets. \nWe can provide an initial digital sky tour if you wish. There is a $20 charge to set up a remote imaging session, and you will\nneed\nto have Timbuktu software (from http://www.netopia.com )\nrunning on your computer. \nThere may be local firewall issues to resolve. See the FOPMO web site for links to DATA ANALYSIS SOFTWARE -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HOW TO BRING YOUR CLASS TO PINE MOUNTAIN OBSERVATORY: DETAILS FOR OBSERVATORY TOURS: Please make advance reservation with Mark Dunaway,\nmarkpmo@oregon.uoregon.edu\nor 541-382-8331 if you are planning to bring your class (or any group\nlarger\nthan 10 people) during regular tour season (Fri-Sat evenings Memorial Day weekend through September, or during the off season). We are now closed due to winter weather, but come March or April if the snows don’t make the road impassable, you may be able to bring your\ngroup to PMO if Mark can fit you in…dark moon weekends fill quickly). Program starts at dusk, check with Mark for exact times as may change\nas\ndarkness falls later or ealier.  Also check with Mark on rates,\nwe’ve\nhad to increase our group rates as we’ve had to find funding for staff\nto\ndrive up.  We’re trying to hold regular Fri-Sat summertime drop in\nrates\nto $3.00/visitor.   Dress warmly (can easily get below\nfreezing\nat the 6500 foot elevation!) and bring a small flashlight covered with\nred\ncellophane or a brown paper bag (to protect everyone's night\nvision). \nWe furnish star charts.  You can stay up with us all night,\nweather\npermitting.  Check the web site for Quick Cam views of the weather\nduring\ndaylight before you come up.  There is a Forest Service campground\njust\nacross the parking lot from the Observatory, first come, first served,\nno\nreservations, no fees.  Primitive campground, you need to bring\nwater. Some schools have made arrangements with teachers at local Bend schools to use their gym to camp out in. Try to pick a non-Full Moon night (moon is very bright and washes out\nfainter\nobjects). For further details, see the How to Visit PMO link and/or call\n541-382-8331. OBSERVATORY TELESCOPE STATUS: 15\" Telescope now has digital setting circles, making finding objects\nmuch\neasier. 24\" Telescope has minor tracking problems in some positions, we\ncontinue\nto work on this, but telescope and PIGGY CCD are basically in service. 32\" Telescope continues to be available for limited collection of\nresearch\ndata with the COWCAM, including images filtered with B, V, or Rfilters. \nContact Rick with your initial proposal, I'll put you in touch with\nProfessor\nBothun to work out the details. Solar Viewing: We now have an H-alpha solar filter for use on our\nportable\n8\" telescope, that allows visitors during daytime to view the huge\nprominences\nblasted out by the Sun.  Normally we have this telescope set up\noutside\nthe 24\" dome on Saturday afternoons, 2-5 PM during the regular\nVisitors'\nSeason."}]}

Individuals vary in their\nsensitivity to poison ivy, but repeated exposure can lead to\nincreased sensitivity.  It would be a good idea for everyone to\navoid this plant. Poison ivy appears in many forms.  The leaflets vary in size,\nglossiness, and marginal notching, but always occur in groups of three. \nIf you avoid all unknown plants with leaves composed of\nthree leaflets, you will be playing it safe. Poison ivy is difficult but not impossible to eradicate.  The\nchief difficulty lies in the chances of becoming poisoned when\ntrying to remove it.  Wear protective clothing, including gloves, whenever\nyou are working near it.  Pulling and grubbing are\neffective means of removal, though they necessitate close contact and will\nprobably need to be repeated once or twice for complete control.  If time\nis not an object, the vines can be smothered by completely covering them\nwith black plastic for several months.\nDo not mow the plants as this will spew bits and pieces of\npoisonous material over the area.  When removing poison ivy, take\nfrequent breaks to change clothes and scrub thoroughly with a\nstrong soap.  Wash contaminated clothing separately.  DO NOT BURN any\nplants that you physically remove.  The resulting smoke can\ncause severe lung damage if inhaled. Herbicides are effective and allow you to control the plant\nwithout getting too close to it.  Several commercial products are available. \nCheck labels to find one that will control poison\nivy, and apply it as directed.  Many of the herbicides for poison ivy\ncontrol contain glyphosate.  This chemical is systemic.  It\nis absorbed by leaves and transferred to stems and roots, and\nslowly causes the death of the entire plant.  It must be applied to an\nactively growing plant for this process to take place; do\nnot apply it during a drought when even poison ivy will not be\ngrowing.  Glyphosate, like most herbicides labelled for poison\nivy removal, is nonselective and will kill any other plants it\ncontacts. Where poison ivy has grown up tree trunks or into hedges, cut the vine\nat ground level.  Remove as much of the stump and roots as\nyou can with a hoe or by pulling.  As regrowth occurs, apply an\nherbicide to the leaves, or keep pulling up the growth.  With\nperseverance, and probably of few itches, poison ivy can be\ncontrolled. --(f_rushingr@NOSPAMccsvax.sfasu.edu) submitted May/21/1994 [Top]"}, {"tag": "h1", "text": "Household mixtures to kill poison ivy plants"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Here is one Ifound.

{"file_number": "145", "plaintext": [{"tag": "p", "text": "Reports Patient Assistance Programs: Do They Really Help the Uninsured ? Areport by Public Advocate Betsy Gotbaum The Facts on Prescription Drug Costs According to the Census Bureau, approximately 41.2 million Americans lacked health insurance in 2002. At the local level, the United Hospital Fund reported that there were approximately 1.6 million uninsured New York City residents in 2000, most of whom are low-income and working.   They also found that one out of four New York City residents under the age of 65 were uninsured. Many of these low-income uninsured individuals face considerable cost barriers to obtaining needed medications and must often pay full price for prescription drugs.  Uninsured non-elderly Americans spent approximately $20 more out-of- pocket per prescription in 1997 compared to the insured non-elderly.  According to the Fiscal Policy Institute, while the cost of all drugs is increasing, brand name drugs are increasing even more rapidly, rising by 10.5 times between 1998 and 2000. With pharmaceuticals playing an increasingly important role in health treatment plans these days, it is alarming to see pharmaceutical costs escalate over the years. The high costs of prescription drugs have caused many uninsured individuals to take less medication than they were prescribed. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 41 percent of uninsured individuals did not fill a prescription because of costs. As rising drug prices force more and more low-income uninsured individuals to make trade-offs between their medications and basic living costs, pharmaceutical companies continue to make profits.   The pharmaceutical industry was the most profitable of all industries on the annual 2001 Fortune 500 list, with the top ten Fortune 500 drug companies earning $37.2 billion in profits in 2001, up from $28.0 billion reported in 2000. History of Patient Assistance Programs Through their patient assistance programs (PAPs), many drug manufacturers claim to offer free medication to low-income individuals who do not have public or private prescription drug coverage.   These programs have been in existence for more than twenty years. The Facts on Patient Assistance Programs While PAPs alone cannot solve all the problems facing low-income individuals lacking prescription drug coverage, the office of the Public Advocate wanted to explore the extent to which PAPs can help alleviate the cost of rising prescription drugs for low-income uninsured New Yorkers.   To this end, the following seven PAPs were examined: • Astra Zeneca • Abbott • Pfizer • Pharmacia • Bristol Myers Squibb • Merck • Schering-Plough These PAPs were chosen because they offer the following ten commonly prescribed drugs in New York : • Lipitor • Prilosec • Glucophage • Celebrex • Zocor • Claritin • Synthroid • Zoloft • Zantac • Vasotec Findings Despite the fact that PAPs claim to give away an estimated two billion dollars in free medication every year, our overall observations were disappointing. • PAPs rarely publicize eligibility requirements Pharmaceutical companies offer free prescription pharmaceuticals to those who fit their eligibility guidelines.   These guidelines are based on set income and asset levels as well as eligibility for prescription drug coverage, public or private.   That is, low-income individuals who do not have any prescription drugs coverage, public or private, would qualify for these patient assistance programs if they satisfy the income eligibility requirements. Unfortunately, we found that only two of the seven pharmaceutical companies we reviewed, Pfizer and Merck, made their income eligibility guidelines public.   Single New Yorkers with annual income levels of $16,000 or less and families with incomes less than $25,000 are eligible for the Pfizer Patient Assistance Program.   Merck’s Patient Assistance Program has a higher income eligibility threshold than Pfizer, allowing singles with income less than $18,000 and families with an income of $24,000 to qualify for the program. Since the annual Medicaid income eligibility limit for single individuals is $7,704 and $11,400 for a family of four, the Pfizer and Merck PAPs could certainly help meet the prescription needs of individuals who do not qualify for Medicaid, but earn too little to afford private prescription coverage. Eligibility guidelines existed for the five remaining PAPs, but they refused to make them public.   Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis, at the discretion of the pharmaceutical company. Without knowing the eligibility guidelines, uninsured individuals and their heath care providers cannot easily determine if they are eligible. • Additional documentation required Although application forms for most PAPs are only two pages long, they require the applicant to fill out detailed financial information.   Four out of the seven programs required applicants to include additional documentation.   For example, Pfizer, Pharmacia, Abbott, and Schering-Plough require applicants to include documentation for all sources of income including tax returns, pay stubs and W-2s.  Those applicants without an income must include a note from their physician or social worker attesting to that fact. • Getting Medication Takes Time The process of getting the medication, from the moment the application is sent to the time the drugs are received by applicants, takes an average of three weeks for a trouble-free application.  Only Pharmacia has a system where applicants are immediately able to access thirty days supply of medication.  Bristol Myers Squibb takes a longer time, with applicants receiving medications in 2-3 weeks. For others like Astra Zeneca, Merck, Schering-Plough, Abbott and Pfizer, it takes 4-6 weeks to get the medications.  Patients in immediate need of medicines may not benefit greatly from these programs. • Most PAPs Do Not Send Medication Directly to Applicants Our review of the seven PAPs found that a majority of them (57%) did not send the approved medication directly to the applicants, even though the applicants obviously had their doctor’s approval.   Only Astra Zeneca sends the medication directly to their applicants, while Pharmacia allows approved applicants to pick up their medication at a participating drug store.   Merck leaves it up to the physician to indicate whom the medication will be sent to. Recommendations With the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals sky-rocketing out of control, patient assistance programs could certainly play a role in helping low-income individuals who lack private prescription coverage.   However, their ability to help meet the medication needs of low-income uninsured individuals falls far short of their potential.   In order for PAPs to fully reach their potential, the Public Advocate recommends the following: Increase Public Awareness of Patient Assistance Programs: While many PAPs have existed for the past two decades, very few people know of them.   For example, out of an estimated 77,000 health care provider offices in New York State , only 4,943 used the Pfizer Patient Assistance Program in 2002. As prices soared for the average pharmaceutical consumer, the industry saw the highest profits for any industry in 2001.  Furthermore, marketing staff at major U.Spharmaceutical manufacturers have increased by 59 percent since 1995. Clearly, pharmaceutical companies have marketing resources at their disposal necessary to increase physician and patient awareness of the available assistance programs.  They must utilize these resources. Make Eligibility Requirements Publicly Available Since many of the PAPs do not publicize their income eligibility requirements, it is often very difficult for potential applicants and their health care providers to determine their eligibility.   This obstacle may deter many from applying.  Therefore, clear eligibility guidelines should be made public. Forego Additional Documentation Requests : Several PAP programs like Astra Zeneca and Bristol Myers Squibb do not require additional documentation with their applications.  This reduces the amount of paperwork applicants and their physicians must complete, making the application process quicker.  PAPs should not require additional documentation with their application forms. Ship Medication Directly to Patients : Sending medication shipments directly to the patient saves the applicant from having to visit the doctor’s office repeatedly. Speedy Access to Medication : Pharmacia has a program called “Patients in Need” that allows applicants to apply over the telephone and get immediate access to medication. Applicants meeting the eligibility criteria are immediately approved for a 30-day supply of medication over the phone.   The applicants must then visit their physician’s office to get their prescriptions and completion of the application forms. Once they have their prescriptions, they can pick up a 30-day supply of medication from a participating pharmacy.   The pharmacy charges the applicant a dispensing fee of $5. As soon as Pharmacia receives the application forms, the approval determination for a continued supply is conducted.   This usually takes around 3-4 weeks.   Pharmacia then mails the pharmacy card directly to the patient. Other PAPs should implement a similar system to ensure that applicants have speedy access to medication. Conclusion The pharmaceutical industry is the most profitable industry in the United States. They continue to see record profits at the expense of the American consumer and therefore have the responsibility to keep medicine affordable for all people, especially for our low-income consumers.  It is not enough for pharmaceutical companies to proclaim corporate responsibility as a public relations ploy; they must back it up with real action.  Working to maximize the potential of PAPs would be a start.

Here was this very frail man, who for the last 12 years knew that he was dying from leukaemia, speaking in sober, almost subdued tones. Never a hint of demagogy, he had just an obvious, moral compunction to tell the truth. He might illustrate his talk with a quote from a Jane Austen novel, or with a passage from the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, or, quite remarkably, at Westminster Central Hall in London a couple of years ago, to an audience of nearly 1,500 people, with a series of huge maps to demolish the fraud behind the Oslo 'peace' agreement (laced with a stinging indictment of the Palestinian leadership who had allowed the Israeli map makers to outmanoeuvre them). There is a wonderful irony that the man who made a lifetime study of the historical misuse of the power of knowledge by the ruling classes in the west was himself able to put his own powerful knowledge at the disposal of the dispossessed. Of course, this meant mainly the Palestinians. But what had really excited Edward Said at the turn of the new century was the way in which Palestine had globalised. The Palestinian flag now has to adorn worldwide protest against globalisation and war. As he wrote in his last essay 'Dignity, Solidarity and the Penal Colony', with death fast approaching, 'In the past six months Ihave lectured in four continents to many thousands of people. What brings them together is Palestine and the struggle of the Palestinian people which is now a byword for emancipation and enlightenment, regardless of all the vilification heaped on them by their enemies. 'It is an extraordinary thing that Palestine was a central issue this year both during the Porto Alegre anti-globalisation meetings as well as during the Davos and Amman meetings, both poles of the worldwide political spectrum.' This essay drew its inspiration simultaneously from the cascading horrors of everyday life in Palestine and the troubled mind of the dissident Jewish Czech writer Franz Kafka. 'There is a remarkable story by Kafka, In the Penal Colony , about a crazed official who shows off a fantastically detailed torture machine whose purpose is to write all over the body of the victim, using a complex apparatus of needles to inscribe the captive's body with minute letters that ultimately causes the prisoner to bleed to death. This is what Sharon and his brigades of willing executioners are doing to the Palestinians.' But Edward Said went to his grave confident that the Palestinians would never give in to it. Edward Said read, absorbed and fully appreciated much of the greatest literary, philosophical and political works that underpin what we sometimes call western civilisation. But the word western, as a description of this civilisation, troubled him deeply. It suggested a flaw. He summoned all his erudition, eloquence and gravitas to expose it. His objection was that western civilisation had misused its knowledge. He spells it out in his most important work, Orientalism . Some left wing critics have baulked at the influence of postmodernism on the book. But, although this does make the book sometimes difficult to read, the sheer power of the argument breaks through. The book is not just about imperialism and colonialism. Edward Said is getting at something far deeper, with a much longer history. It is about the very foundation stones of western civilisation itself. In Orientalism there is a description of Napoleon invading Egypt at the end of the 18th century and the building of the Suez Canal, later, in the 19th century: 'What more than anything impressed the first Arab chronicler of the expeditions, Abd-al-Rahman al-Jabarti, was Napoleon's use of scholars to manage his contacts with the natives.' Napoleon had brought with him virtually an entire French university. Its scholars already had knowledge of Egypt, that is, of its classical past. They understood that European civilisation had roots in this part of the world. Its occupation of the territory helped lay claim to those roots. The thinking was this: the natives have missed out on their own history. Never mind. An additional advantage of the occupation is that the natives can now be educated about their own past. This might have been more convincing if the great archaeological finds that the Europeans then began excavating had ended up in Cairo's museums rather than those of London and Paris, or if the 'natives' were, in any sense, to be treated as equal partners in the rediscovery of the past. But this was not the intention. 'Because Egypt was saturated with meaning for the arts, sciences and government, its role was to be the stage on which actions of world historical importance would take place. By taking Egypt, then, a modern power would naturally demonstrate its strength and justify history; Egypt's own destiny was to be annexed.' The real significance of Europe's intervention in Egypt would become blindingly obvious later in the following century with the digging of the Suez Canal. As a Thomas Cook brochure helpfully pointed out (yes, it's the ancestor of our own T Cook--the travel industry was one of the great entrepreneurial initiatives of the day) the Pharaohs had begun a canal project. So once again Europe was simply recalling the glories of the ancient bygone age on behalf of the natives. Or was it really another European crusade with modern technology?"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Afather and son survey the remains of their home in Palestine"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Civilisation"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "'The whole world seemed crowded in to render homage to a scheme that God could only bless and make use of himself. Old distinctions and inhibitions were dissolved: the Cross faced down the Crescent, the West had come to the Orient never to leave...' Except of course, as Orientalism points out, when Nasser, Egypt's first genuinely independent nationalist ruler, had the effrontery to take over the canal in 1956. Then all the foul racism locked into western civilisation came hurtling to the surface. Islam had posed a major problem for the western civilising mission. The French and the British had been ready to celebrate every earlier glory, but about this one, they were silent. Not that the western scholars were ignorant. They knew that Islam had carried the torch of civilisation after the fall of Rome 1,400 yeas ago. Orientalism reports on Gibbon in his classic history, Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire , marvelling at the speed at which the Islamic revolution had finished off the Roman Empire. But to remind themselves, and the natives, of Islam's former glory would be to undermine the whole project. This was western civilisation rediscovering its roots to enforce its power and authority in the emerging modern world. There was no way it was going to recognise an eastern civilisation equally. 'Islam was a provocation in many ways. It lay uneasily close to Christianity, geographically and culturally. It drew on the Judao-Hellenic traditions. It borrowed creatively from Christianity--it could boast unrivalled military and political successes. Nor was this all. The Islamic lands sit adjacent to and even on top of the biblical lands. Moreover, the heart of the Islamic domain has always been the region closest to Europe...Arabic and Hebrew are Semitic languages, and together they dispose and redispose of material that is urgently important to Christianity. From the end of the 7th century to the 16th century, Islam in either its Arab, Ottoman, North African or Spanish form dominated or effectively threatened European Christianity. That Islam outstripped and outshone Rome cannot have been absent from the mind of any European.' Islam had to be marginalised. The 'western' in western civilisation takes its debut, at least in part, from this ousting of Islam. Was this not what the Crusades had been about, 1,000 years ago? Less well known is the way one of the greatest artistic leaders of the European Renaissance, Dante in Florence, humiliates the memory of Islam's founder Mohammed. In Dante's Inferno , the eternal punishment inflicted upon Mohammed for being an 'imposter' is, as Edward Said says, a 'peculiarly disgusting one', the detail of which the reader here will be spared. Dante wished to characterise the 'Orient as alien...and incorporate it on to the theatrical stage...for Europe'. Islam is turned into the outsider against which 'the whole of European civilisation from the Middle Ages on is founded'. Palestine's most accomplished and brilliant spokesperson, then, should also be remembered for his exposure of the roots of the west's Islamophobia. The worldwide anti-war movement that has begun to forge an extraordinary coalition between Muslims and the reviving secular left is itself an unintended tribute to him. The Palestinian flag helps bind together this unlikely coalition. Edward Said knew more than anyone else that the Palestinians could not defeat Zionism and its US backers by themselves. The more that the global anti-war movement rallies to Palestine, the greater the prospect of unleashing the wider forces necessary to bring Zionism crashing down."}]}

From his observations, Agassiz concluded that this blanket of boulders, sand, and clay had been spread across much of Europe by large continental glaciers during a prehistoric Ice Age. Much of what Agassiz saw could be explained only by glacial action. Because a glacier is a solid mass of ice, it moves very slowly, and as it moves, it picks up all sizes of debris, ranging from huge boulders to fine silts and clays. As the ice melts, all the debris is left behind as a layer of poorly sorted material. From the nature and distribution of glacial deposits, geologists have formed a picture of what the Earth looked like during a glacial event. In the same manner, geologists have recognized rocks that were once ancient beach deposits because most beaches are composed of well-sorted sand. The action of waves along the shores of ancient seas washed out the silt and clay and left behind rounded grains of sand, just as those along present shorelines. Offshore, where the bottom waters are calmer, the finer sediment settles as mud. In a general way, the size of the sediment grains shows the direction of slope on the sea floor, because the sandy sediment will be near the shore and the mud will be offshore. This same principle of sorting also applies to ancient rocks; marine sandstones and conglomerates were formed closer to shore than were the finer textured marine shales and siltstones. The same concept of sorting can be used with nonmarine formations, such as river and delta deposits , to determine the direction of paleoslope (ancient slope). Rivers (like waves) sort the rock debris, leaving the coarser materials near the head of the stream and carrying the finer materials downstream toward the coast."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Fluviatile cross beds in Supai Sandstone, Grand Canyon, Arizona.

By determining the direction in which the cross beds are inclined, geologists can tell the direction in which water flowed when the sand grains were deposited. Even today, sands are forming cross beds, particularly in river channels and in shoal areas where ripplelike dunes form across the channel. Like dunes in a desert, these dunes slowly move in a downstream direction. The current carries the sand grains up the gently inclined upstream side of the dunes and deposits them on the steeper sloping downstream side. The inclined layers of sand are deposited on the  front of the dune, producing beds with a downstream (downcurrent) dip. Dip measurements from a great many cross beds in rocks of the same age that are exposed over a wide area show a useful pattern of ancient flow direction (paleocurrent).

In fact, during much of geologic time, large parts of the continental United States were covered by shallow seas in which lime, mud, and sand accumulated. The maps show that the mountain ranges have buckled the Earth's crust from time to time. Most of these ranges were located along the eastern and western margins of the present continent, and erosion of newly formed highlands contributed sediment toward the center of the continent. Eventually, these ranges were worn down (as in the Appalachian region during the Cretaceous Period). The process of mountain building continued, however, either by renewed uplift and erosion of old mountain ranges such as in the Appalachians, or by building new and youthful mountains such as those that make up the Coast Range of California. The appearance of our continent has been continuously changed by this complicated sequence of mountain building, erosion, and deposition of sediment in slowly sinking troughs, followed by more crustal movement. These changes are still going on today, although they are so gradual that only occasionally do we become aware of them. One dramatic effect of change is the jolting movement of a portion of the Earth's crust during an earthquake. Another is the fire and devastation associated with the building of a volcano during eruptions, like that of Mount St. Helens in 1980.

The sordid affair began when McManus, at the time V.P. for CBS Sports, went\nto an Upper East Side bar on the night of the 1997 U.S. Open and met Charlotte von Vogt , a then 46-year-old part-time prostitute and\nformer bra model once known for having “the most beautiful breasts in the\nworld”—at least according to famed flack Dick Falk .\nThe exec reportedly enjoyed a few rounds of cocktails with the buxom blonde, then invited her back to his Park Avenue apartment for a nightcap.

Tentatively called One Park Avenue after the company’s Manhattan address (“We don’t own the rights to that title yet,” the source noted, saying the producer would have to license them from the building), the show will be “about the lives of the people who work here versus just about the magazines.” According to multiple AMI sources, those willing to sacrifice their remaining shreds of dignity to the company’s multimedia ambitions will indeed be paid. “We get pitches all the time from people, and this is just one of many,” the source said. “I’m sure if you call any magazine company, everyone is looking to get their name on TV. Imean, Glamor , Vogue , Us Weekly , Rolling Stone , Seventeen —they’re all looking for opportunities to get on TV.” The source declined to name the producer who pitched the series, saying only that he was “pretty well-established” in the genre.

After all, the former Gucci designer has previously told reporters the “entire issue would be naked,” and his recent work has certainly showcased his fondness for letting it all hang out—he posed au naturel for a 22-page spread in last month’s W , his new line of cosmetics for Estee Lauder is called Amber Nude, his ad campaign for the fragrance Youth Dew features a naked Carolyn Murphy , and an advertisement he produced for a new line of sunglasses reportedly features porn stars whom he says were paid “to have sex on set.” Neither Ford nor VF spokeswoman Beth Kseniak returned calls about the incident. McAdam’s manager, Shelley Browning , confirmed that McAdams “presently does not have a publicist,” but referred questions about the cover shoot to the magazine.  Van Iden herself did not return calls. UPDATE: So much for dignity. Even though McAdams fired her publicist for neglecting to tell her she was expected to pose nude, we hear\nshe ultimately decided a VF cover was too\ngood to pass up and returned to disrobe anyway. We also hear Van Iden, her\nfired rep,\nwasn’t even on set when it happened. Atop-tier Hollywood player\nwrites\nin: “Ame was absolutely set up by Vanity Fair .

Ever since the unknown 26-year-old actor—whose career highlights consist of a season on One Life to Live and an episode of Will & Grace —landed the part over Warner Brothers’ reported favorite Jim Caviezel , fanboy bloggers have been wondering whether the famously beefcake-friendly filmmaker’s decision had more to do with his libido than his director’s eye. Of course, if Singer cast an object of his desire in a role, it wouldn’t be the first time. According to Alex Burton , the unknown who played Pyro in Singer’s first X-Men blockbuster, he was given the part after a hot-tub session with the director at a Hollywood party. “Bryan created that role especially for me,” says Burton, who went on to act in exactly zero films post- X-Men . (Singer, it seems, has a thing for water. Following the filming of Apt Pupil , a number of young male extras on the movie filed lawsuits claiming that they had been bullied into stripping naked for a shower scene and that Singer had held private screenings of the wet ‘n’ wild footage at his home. The suits never reached court.) Whether or not Routh (“rhymes with mouth ,” according to Newsweek ; “B.J.” to his friends, according to IMDB ) knows his way around a loofah, early press on the film has only fanned the proverbial flames. As Superman Returns actress Parker Posey told Newsweek (albeit, completely out of context), “Poor Brandon. He’s got everyone touching him all the time. He’s lying on his stomach and he’s got five people coming up and pulling his underwear down, sticking their hands up the butt of his suit. Ican’t imagine what it’s like.” (The article goes on to say that “the biggest issue for the studio” was what size to make Superman’s “package.”) Further driving chatter on online message boards is the out director’s track record of putting together gay-friendly productions. Kevin Spacey , who has long ducked questions about his sexuality, was the centerpiece of Singer’s breakout film The Usual Suspects (he also appears in Superman Returns , as Lex Luthor), and the director’s two X-Men movies—about teen superheroes fighting for acceptance (and starring Hugh Jackman , Alan Cumming and Sir Ian McKellan )—were widely interpreted as allegories for coming out of the closet. In fact, one particularly out-there bit of gossip making the rounds is that Singer cast Routh specifically because he wanted a closeted actor who could “come out” as a political statement-cum-publicity-stunt in the run-up to the movie’s June ‘06 premiere. Asked about Routh’s path to the silver screen, his publicist at PMK, Simon Halls , said that while he rarely comments on his clients’ personal lives, “Ithink it only fair to tell you that Brandon is happily involved with his longtime girlfriend, and any claims to the contrary are just plain silliness.” Arep for Singer did not respond to calls or detailed e-mails seeking comment.

Sources say a number of the city’s news outlets have recently received legal letters from Lynda Goldman , a high-powered attorney—and partner at pitbull entertainment lawyer Marty Singer ’s firm, no less—whom the former Wmag staffer has hired to keep her personal details out of the press. Though Goldman would not specify which publications have been contacted, she confirmed that she was retained “to encourage the media to behave in a responsible manner so that this victim isn’t victimized further.” The former Wstaffer—whose identity, while known in media circles, has been kept out of print—has been keeping a low profile since the Halloween attack, when Braunstein, a onetime co-worker at the fashion glossy, reportedly gained access to her Chelsea apartment by masquerading as a fireman, knocked her out with chloroform, and tied her to a chair before sexually molesting her for 12 hours. “I’ve been dealing with some issues because we’re very concerned about her privacy while this guy is still at large,” said Goldman. “It’s obviously very disturbing that he’s still out there and that he’s evaded the authorities for all this time, so any kind of identifying information that could lead him or other people to locate her is a major invasion of privacy that could put her life in jeopardy.” Among the published details she finds particularly worrisome are where the victim works, where she lives, and even the name of her next-door neighbor, the attorney said. “And that’s not an inclusive list,” she added. While some have speculated that the victim hired a lawyer to keep her own identity under wraps until she is prepared to go public in some remunerative fashion, Goldman insists that’s not the case. “Iwasn’t retained because she’s working on a book or movie or any nonsense like that,” she said. “Iwas retained because she was concerned, as anyone would be in her circumstance, about her privacy and her safety.” She added, however, that her client might be interested in telling her side of the story “somewhere down the road when this guy is incarcerated.” Goldman—who explained she was chosen to represent her client because the two women “share a mutual friend”—said although she herself relies on newspaper reports for developments in the case, she is frustrated by how much info the media-savvy Braunstein might be gleaning from the coverage. “Some of the reporting I’ve seen just seems to me incredibly irresponsible,” she said. “If I’m reading a report in the press of somebody saying, ‘We just saw him at x location going to all these strip clubs,’ don’t you think that he reads the papers and says, ‘Oh, guess Ibetter not go to any more strip clubs?’” Asked whether she had considered the possibility that police had planted those stories to flush Braunstein out, Goldman admitted, “Idon’t know what law enforcement does during these situations, but as a citizen reading this stuff, it just strikes me as foolish.” Photo: NYDN"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Regan Flack Fights Back"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Publishing seductress Judith Regan has gotten away with her vindictive tantrums in the past, but sources say she may have chosen the wrong foe in her former PR director, Paul Crichton . Friends of the well-liked publicist say he hired an attorney to look into a possible libel suit after Regan dispatched a minion to smear him in the New York Post . “Paul’s lawyer and his friends are all urging him to sue Regan and [Regan Books parent company] HarperCollins for defamation of character, slander, libel, whatever, for what they said about him in the Post ,” says a source close to Crichton, referring to last Wednesday’s Page Six item in which Paula Conway —identified as “Regan Media’s interim PR director”—accused the publicist of clearing his desk “at like midnight” and sneaking away after being questioned about “unauthorized spending in his department.” “It was all a lie—he was never under investigation for anything,” says the source. (HarperCollins reps declined to comment on a departing employee, but a company source confirmed to the New York Daily News ’s Lowdown column that there was never an investigation.) Furthermore, a top-level Regan Books employee said she didn’t know anything about Conway or an “interim PR director.” According to our source, that’s because “Paula is really just a freelance publicist who happens to be a close personal friend of Maureen Regan , Judith’s sister.” The two women are also co-authors of a book called The Beauty Buyble: The Top 100 Beauty Products of 2006 , scheduled to be published by Regan’s imprint next year. The real reason Crichton decided to leave—after shepherding 13 of Regan’s books onto the New York Times best-seller list—was that his boss was working him like a Siberian husky in the Iditarod, says our source. We’re told that the slight, 32-year-old publicist lost 10 pounds after taking on the responsibilities of associate publisher and director of marketing, in addition to his regular duties, when those positions were vacated in July. “Paul worked his ass off, but Judith was insisting that he sign a three-year contract at the same pay he was receiving before he took on the additional jobs and, on top of that, move to L.A.,” where Regan recently moved her operations, the source says. “When he called her to say he wouldn’t sign and to give notice, she hung up on him. Anyway, you can’t blame him for not looking forward to working with Victoria Gotti , Janice Dickinson , and Kimora Lee —all of whom have books coming out next year.” But while rumors have been circulating that Crichton may want to vent some of his frustrations by writing a tell-all detailing his ex-boss’s mean streak and infamous private exploits (like her ill-fated affair with wannabe Homeland Security czar Bernard Kerik ; call it, The Devil Wears Nada ) the publicist’s pal laughs the notion off, saying, “he’s no Bridie Clark .” Another former Regan Books employee, Clark is already hard at work on a roman à clef about the company—in which staffers are thinly disguised to skirt her confidentiality agreement, entitled Because She Can . Besides, Crichton may not have much time for writing. We’re told he’s starting a new job next Monday. Crichton himself could not be reached for comment, and calls to a Regan Books publicist were not returned by press time.

Long admired for sustaining one of the arena-rock world’s most stable marriages—their eleventh anniversary is later this month—the couple recently fell out over Sambora’s desire to give their 8-year-old daughter, Ava Elizabeth , a sibling, according to a source close to the band. We’re told the 44-year-old Locklear, who frequently complains about movie execs’ disdain for aging actresses, thinks a second child would hurt her chances at landing the sexy roles she specializes in. “She doesn’t want another kid because she thinks she’s Hollywood royalty,” says our source. “But Richie is an only child and desperately wants another kid.” Another strain on the couple is the fact that Sambora has just embarked on a seven-month, 20-country world tour with Bon Jovi to promote their new album Have a Nice Day —and we’re told the band is doing everything they can to convince him to “dump [Locklear] and move on.” “The members of the band never liked her anyway, particularly Jon [Bon Jovi],” says the source. “The band’s a bunch of blue-collar stiffs from New Jersey who feel that they got lucky. They’re regular guys, and Heather is spoiled—she still thinks that’s she’s an ingénue.” But Sambora isn’t the only one looking for a way out, we hear. According to our source, Locklear has been “stepping out” on her husband. One person the Perfect Man actress has been spotted with frequently in recent months is her ex-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee . As the New York Post ’s Page Six reported, Locklear invited the tattoo-festooned sex-tape auteur back to her place with six female friends after celebrating her birthday at a Manhattan restaurant in October. Apparently she’s forgiven Lee for his affair with porn star Debi Diamond , the incident that ended their marriage of seven years in 1993. Asked about the marital issues, a spokeswoman for Locklear and Sambora said, “There is absolutely no truth to any of this.

Richardson first became a thorn in Schwarzenegger’s beefy flank when she was quoted in various news stories—including a landmark Premiere magazine article headlined “Arnold the Barbarian”—saying that the actor had pulled her onto his lap and pinched her nipple after a December 2000 interview for her London-based show Big Screen . When Schwarzenegger’s team attacked her in an October 2003 Los Angeles Times story about the then-candidate’s wandering hands—claiming that she’d hopped on his lap, seductively cupped her breasts and asked, “What do you think of these?”—the 35-year-old vicar’s daughter filed a libel suit against the governor and two of his associates. Since then, we hear, the governor and his lawyer, Marty Singer , have tried every lowdown trick in the book to weasel out of the lawsuit—even going so far as to refuse to accept the service of legal papers for nearly a year, according to a source close to Richardson. (We’re told Singer only relented after her barrister, Graham Atkins , sent him at least three personal letters demanding that he take the case seriously.) Schwarzenegger has also tried to distance himself from the suit, saying Sheryl Main (the Columbia Tristar flack quoted in the L.A. Times story, now a member of the governor’s communications team) and Sean Walsh (a former campaign spokesman, now director of the state Office of Planning and Research) were not acting with his knowledge or at his behest when they disseminated the slur. Our source says that, in papers filed in his defense, the governor has even denied any official connection to “Californians for Schwarzenegger,” the nonprofit reelection committee that is paying the trio’s legal fees. If that’s the case, the governor may want to refresh his memory. According to municipal documents, Schwarzenegger owns Main Street Plaza, the Santa Monica building that houses the committee’s headquarters. In another curious passage in his defense papers, we’re told that Schwarzenegger “denies that he has a history of sexual misconduct… and the Claimant must prove the grounds on which she alleges that any such history is now admitted or well-documented or was at the time of his election campaign a matter of public knowledge.” While the governor may somehow be under the impression that Brits can’t read American publications, which have obsessively covered Arnold’s multiple groping allegations, the governor’s own admission that “where there’s smoke, there’s fire” and that he’s “behaved badly” towards women have been trumpeted by a dozen UK papers as well. At least Richardson is having it easier than Rhonda Miller . After the former stuntwoman announced the day before Schwarzenegger’s election that he had grabbed her breasts, Walsh told reporters that Miller had a history of prostitution and drug abuse. Though the allegations were completely untrue, Miller’s suit was overturned in court thanks to America’s defendant-friendly libel laws. (Luckily for Richardson, Brit law puts the burden of proof on the defense in such cases.) At the end of the day, Schwarzenegger’s maneuvers will probably come to naught. Ever since a judge declared the governor was “not peripheral” to the case, experts have predicted that a settlement is the only way for Schwarzenegger to avoid an inconvenient appearance before a judge in a powdered wig—probably during his 2006 reelection campaign. Reached for comment, Singer declined to discuss his defense strategy—”I’m not an English attorney, but I’ve been told that you’re not supposed to comment on papers filed”—but denied that he or Schwarzenegger had resisted being served. “We resisted jurisdiction ,” Singer said. “That’s why the papers weren’t accepted, per se. When the process server came to the office, it was voluntarily accepted. There was no evasion of service.” The high-priced attorney did confirm that there had been “numerous communications between me and the plaintiff’s lawyer,” but he wouldn’t go into detail. As for a settlement, “we haven’t discussed it,” he said, adding, for good measure, “You’re a tabloid reporter, and these are stupid questions.” Aspokesman for the governor could not be reached by deadline.

Sources at Us Weekly say the mag’s West Coast editor, Ken Baker, has gotten a little too close to Paris Hilton , and that his not-so-secret obsession with his number-one source is affecting his coverage. According to insiders at the gossip glossy, the 35-year-old Baker spends a large part of his day on the phone with Paris, and insists on putting a positive spin on anything published about the heiress—much to the consternation of his boss, Janice Min . “Ithink this goes far beyond a crush,” confides a friend of Hilton’s. “Every time her phone rings, it’s Ken. He calls more than any other guy, even more than her boyfriends.” The relationship has clearly benefited Baker, who is seen as something of a wunderkind in the business for his ability to bring in celebrity exclusives. Since Paris first appeared on the national scene in 2003 with her infrared sex tape, Us Weekly has broken the lion’s share of Hilton-related scoops—her break-up with Nick Carter , her harrowing account of her hacked Sidekick ordeal, and her engagement to Paris Latsis . (The couple’s breakup, we broke . US weekly followed up a week later with the “official” story , straight from Hilton herself.) What could the two possibly be talking about? According to a mag insider, “Paris uses Ken to plant negative items about her enemies, like Nicole Richie .” In fact, one of the memos found on Hilton’s pilfered Sidekick—“tell ken about jess trying to bone JT”—was widely deciphered as a reminder to tell Baker that Jessica Simpson was stalking the wild Timbersnake . (The phone’s address book, conveniently enough, contained Baker’s digits, too.) Even in public, Baker has made little attempt to conceal his admiration for his prize canary: he once told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteran , “When it comes to Paris Hilton, you either love her, loathe her, or lust after her, but either way … you have to admit she’s fascinating,” and even based a character on her—the inventively named London Marriott—in his new satirical roman a clef, Hollywood Hussein . Sadly, the feeling apparently isn’t mutual: “Paris thinks it’s funny when he calls, and will sometimes taunt and even abuse him,” says Hilton’s pal. “She brags that he’s obsessed with her and wants to fuck her.” That’s gratitude for you. Asked about his special friendship with the hotel heiress, Baker played down his role in bringing home the Hilton bacon and denied there was any “quid pro quo” involved. “Paris has chosen to give exclusive interviews to Us on several occasions because, Iwould imagine, she realizes our young readership is her fan base,” he said. “Also, Us Weekly has covered several major news events concerning Paris Hilton with aggressive journalism. For example, we were the only magazine to run a cover on her Sidekick scandal and, most recently, we broke news that Paris had ‘stolen’ Mary Kate Olsen ’s boyfriend. I’d imagine Paris would have prefered these stories weren’t given so much coverage, but as a news magazine that is our responsibility to our readers.” Baker went on to say that the idea Paris toyed with him on the phone was a “fiction,” adding that he hadn’t interviewed her in over a month. “If you hear from her, tell her Isaid ‘Hi!’” We tried to, but Hilton’s crisis manager, Elliot Mintz , did not return calls or e-mails, and her publicist, PMK’s Jack Ketsoyan , was “traveling” and could not be reached.

Schaffel—who recently aired a phone message on Good Morning America in which the singer declares, “Ilove you, Marc. Ireally need you to get $7 million for me as soon as possible”—is seeking $3 million in loans to Jackson that remain unpaid. But not long ago he was loyally working as the gloved one’s business partner and producer on both his disastrous 2001 album Invincible and a 9/11 tribute concert Jackson planned to hold in Washington D.C. Jacko watchers may also recall Schaffel’s star turn as an unindicted co-conspirator in the singer’s most recent round of pedophilia allegations. It was for the 9/11 tribute project that Schaffel (who, under the nom de porn “Marc Fredericks,” has directed over 400 gay porn titles including The Man With the Golden Rod and Cocktales ), turned to David Kuo, then an adviser to President Bush and the deputy director of the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives. Jackson’s script featured a little boy holding the hand of an older man on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial while 50 pop stars, including Britney Spears and Carlos Santana , sang the treacly song in the shadow of America’s 16th president. There was just one snag: in the wake of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, Washington’s memorial sites were closed or heavily secured. According to Joe Becker , a West Wing producer enlisted to work on the video for Jackson’s tribute, Kuo was the team’s “man in the White House.” Despite the lockdown, Jackson and Schaffel were cleared to make the video at the site. “Representatives of the Parks Service said that the go ahead for us to use the Lincoln Memorial had come straight from the White House,” Becker recalls, adding that Jackson returned Kuo’s favor by providing backstage passes to a concert at RFK Stadium in D.C., and that the presidential adviser then “invited members of my staff to the concert and had them over to the White House mess hall for lunches.” In the end, the project was scuttled after Schaffel’s XXX-rated resume became public. Becker says he lost $120,000 of his own money that he had invested in the filming, expecting to be reimbursed. “When it came out that Schaffel was in gay porn and that Jackson had some serious legal problems, Kuo tried to act like he never knew them,” Becker said. “It would have been laughable if Ihadn’t been taken for all that money.” Reached for comment, Kuo acknowledged that he had met with both Schaffel and Jackson about the tribute—”Imet with hundreds of people a week at the White House”—but denied that he had helped gain them access to the Lincoln Memorial. “After 9/11 the White House was tasked with reaching out to people from the charitable world and Jackson had gotten in touch with us about some song that he was doing just like he had done ‘We are the World,’” Kuo said. “Ididn’t have a relationship with either guy, and Inever invited staff on the project to come eat lunch at the cafeteria.” Kuo claims that concert promoter Clear Channel, not Jackson, provided his backstage passes to the RFK concert. And his opinion of Jackson? “Imet him for a few minutes,” Kuo said, “and Ihad no particular reaction.” Kuo insisted that as far as he knew, no pedophilia charges had been brought against Jackson at the time. Kuo has since stepped down from the Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives to take a contributing editor position at beliefnet.org , which recently published his attack on the administration for not doing enough for religious groups (“There was minimal senior White House commitment to the faith-based agenda,” he wrote).

Hillary Clinton . Publicly at least, the junior Senator from New York still insists she hasn’t made up her mind about a presidential run. But while her coy denials and growing war chest have kept many Democratic opponents on the sidelines, at least one party poobah has not been shy about checking out her competition. Sources close to the Democratic National Committee claim that Bill Clinton has recently held a series of secret meetings with Virginia Gov. Mark Warner , a much-hyped party moderate who is rapidly emerging as his wife’s most significant challenger for the Democratic nomination. The affable, press-friendly Warner recently sealed his star status in the party after engineering the election of his lieutenant governor, Tim Kaine , to take his place in the governor’s mansion, handing the Dems one of their most significant electoral victories in traditionally red-state Virginia earlier this month. Sources say the former president has grown enamored of Warner, a detail-oriented policy wonk who, like Clinton, rose to prominence as the moderate governor of a conservative Southern state. Even as she fights off competition from the right, Hillary has other problems to worry about. As a host of prospective opponents, including senators John Kerry , Joe Biden , and Barack Obama , have lined up to demand a swift departure from Iraq, Mrs. Clinton’s stay-the-course message has eroded her support among the party’s progressives. Furious over her refusal to join a growing chorus of Democratic voices calling for an immediate withdrawal, a few leading party doves are accusing the former first lady of putting politics before principle in an effort to cultivate New York’s Jewish vote. “Ithink a lot of Democrats were surprised when she said that we should stay in Iraq at least through the December Iraqi elections,” says one high-level party insider. “But you can’t win New York State without the support of the state’s pro-Israel Jewish community.” While pundits claim that Democrat contendors historically need two thirds of the Jewish vote in New York to win a Senate campaign, Clinton received a mere 53 percent in her 2000 run against Rick Lazio —a scare she presumably doesn’t want to see repeated. But the senator’s supporters dismiss this charge as “ridiculous,” pointing out that polls show that the state’s Jewish community is as divided about the war as the general electrorate is. “It’s just race baiting,” claims an aggreived Clinton pal who is outraged by the Washington whisper campaign. “Their justified opposition to the war has caused them to adopt the GOP’s worst tactics, but the poll numbers disprove the whole theory.” Due to the Thanksgiving holiday, reps for the Clintons and Governor Warner could not be reached for comment.

My tastes being different (since my IQ so obviously is, too), Ihaven't divulged it so far. But the time has come to spill the beans. My favourite writer is Abuzilowich Milasinovic. Who's he? Oh, shame on you! Abuzilowich Milasinovic was the first recipient of the Abuzilowich Milusinovic award for emerging talent. He won it in April 1998 for his book \"Adding up the summers\" and was the first Eskimo to win this award, which was not much of a surprise since he was actually the first to win the award too. It was he who put the Eskimos on the literary map by winning such a prestigious award. The literary world sat up, took notice and honoured his achievement by naming a prestigious award for emerging talent, prestigious because it was named after a legendary writer like him who had won it. So impressed were they that the award was instituted retrospectively from 1998 onwards. He went on to win it in the year of inception, as mentioned above. In case you do a google search on his name, you will find that \"Abuzilowich Milasinovic  did not match any documents\". He clearly has done enough other things in life to not have the time for matching any documents, whatever that means. Of late, he has been working as a career consultant. Before that, he was in an igloo for ages. Ionly know him through his work- and Idon't mean the igloo by that. Ifind Abuzilimovich Milasinovic's depiction of the sweltering Arctic summers to be extremely moving. Below is an excerpt. He does tend to digress from the main point at times.: \"... It is difficult to juggle writing with career consultancy, as difficult as juggling snowballs in the harsh arctic summers, since they have an unfortunate tendency to turn to water in mid-juggle in the heat. The sheer frustration at having to throw up the snowballs only to watch them melt makes me almost want to throw up, and Iam not referring to the snowballs when Isay \"want to throw up\". Though a teetotaller, the sight of seeing the balls melt when so high has made me crave for a highball a couple of times, and once again Iam not referring to the snowballs when Isay \"crave for a highball.\" That is the price Ihave to pay for having an oddball hobby, and for the third time, Imust clarify that Iam not actually referring to the snowballs themselves when Isay oddball hobby. Any allusion to the tragedy mentioned above depresses me, so after the paragraph above, I'm not exactly dancing with joy. I'm less close to dancing with joy than Iwas on that tragic afternoon two months ago when Inarrowly missed the world record of juggling a snowball (Yes, juggling just one. That's the hardest.) for 337 minutes when it melted after 336 minutes and 40 seconds. Ibroke down at having lost an opportunity to break the world record. The only mitigating factor was that it was my own mark that Iwas trying to best, and that Ihad bettered my world record 392 times already, since nobody else actually juggled with one ball, let alone a snowball. However, it was catastrophic enough to melt even a heart of stone, and no, Ido not mean melt literally, as in melting a snowball. (What a depressing couple of paragraphs these have been. Imust remember to never mention this snowball diversion again to anybody.) In fact, Ihave decided that Ishould do away with one of my main professions, where Ido not count the dalliance with snowball juggling as a full-fledged profession. Idid career consultancy for myself to find out which one Ishould stick on to- writing or career consultancy, and abandoned writing. But now that I've written about the experience, Ifind myself on the horns of a nightmarish logical catch 22 ish dilemma, which is as difficult to come out of as, as Ihave mentioned previously, juggling writing with career consultancy or juggling snowballs in the harsh arctic summers. It has snowballed into a crisis of career threatening proportions, and no, Iam definitely not alluding to juggling the snowballs when Isay \"snowballed into a crisis\"...\" -  from \"Adding up the summers\" by  Abuzilimovich Milasinovic. Ibelieve he has a sequel titled \"Chilling out in the winters\" ready. Describes the tropical South Indian winters. Can't wait to get my hands on it. What a versatile writer!"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "posted by Rajk @ 10:48 PM 4 comments"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Friday, August 18, 2006"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Jest not cricket"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "(Profiles of cricketers! What better topic can one put one's efforts into? I'm not going to pretend that this is completely original. It is not an ethical scruple that comes in the way, but a knowledge that such plagiarism would be hard to carry off, considering how famous that post is. However, Ipromise to not write even one sentence which has even a slight similarity with anything in that post. This might be construed as parodying Sidin. Idon't want to do that. No one makes fun of Sidin. Not even me.) Sunil Gavaskar Gavaskar decided early in his career to play only the balls that would get him out and to leave as many balls as possible. This would have been a sound strategy but for the fact that he was such a good batsman that only an unplayable ball could get him out. As a result, he could only play the unplayable balls and tried to do so for the first two years of his career with catastrophic results. Wisely, he soon realised that this was impossible, and took the career-changing decision to not play any ball. Consequently, he wasn't the most exciting of batsmen to watch. His primary contribution has been to develop 8137 ways of not offering a shot. The only hope for bowlers was that Gavaskar would put himself to sleep which rarely happened once he got his eye in. He is the first cricketer to have been the answer to a quiz question , the question being \"Who is the first cricketer to be the answer to a quiz question?\" Gavaskar's most memorable innings came in his debut 20-20 match. Chasing 56 for victory, he scored a glorious unbeaten hundred in 853 balls and singlehandedly led India to a famous win with 33.4 overs to spare. It was an innings that will not be forgotten by those who managed to watch it completely which, incidentally, was the attendance on the day- crowd who left in disgust- crowd who fell ill due to boredom- crowd who were evicted for throwing stones. Old timers still mention the innings fondly, usually preceded by the words \"Thank God Imissed...\" Some of his play outside his offstump has become legendary. Spectators recall the ball hitting the wicket keeper's gloves with a sweet thud when he left it outside the offstump, which was most of the time. He also played an unforgettable innings chasing 138 in a Test Match and led India to the threshold of victory. It was a testament to his ability to shut off eveything but the ball. India eventually finished on 134/0. Scoring 6 runs in 107 balls when his opening partner had scored a 100 in 90 balls was a staggering achievement, but doing so when India needed quick runs was the mark of a champion. Gavaskar later said that it was very much like Bradman's 254 at Lord's- every ball went where he wanted it to go, to the keeper. Gavaskar expressed delight at being unbeaten at the end, particularly because he was beaten virtually throughout the innings. Such, he wrote, are the delightful paradoxes of the game. The only blot in his career has been accusations from animal lovers that another of his glittering knocks at Lords was responsible for the unfortunate death of Peter, the Lord's cat, due to sheer boredom, in 1965. Gavaskar has always denied these allegations. Staunchly proud of his coutry, he attacked a ticket counter at Lord's which refused to sell tickets to Indians, accusing them of racism. He put his reputation on the line to stand up for his country men. It is another matter that the tickets were not being sold to Englishmen also, primarily because all the tickets had been sold out. Whichever way, it is remembered today as the most daring, and in fact only, counterattack in his long career. Dennis Lilee said of him- \"I'd like to see him play with a stump- I'm sure he'd do okay since he hardly makes contact with the ball anyway.\" With the emergence of Gavaskar, a nation woke up to the fact that come rain or shine, cricket would always be sunny from then on- as sunny, pleasant and comfortable as a Chennai summer day. Anil Kumble Anil Kumble was to bowling what Dravid is to batting. Dravid redefined batting by not playing a shot, Kumble redefined spin bowling by not spinning the ball. Dravid was associated with the straight bat; Kumble with the straight ball. It is an irony that a man named after a circle preferred to bowl straight. This wasn't because he couldn't spin the ball. One of the cleverest bowlers of all time, Kumble estimated early on in his career that a leg break- googly bowler could beat batsmen only half the time- either when he played a leg break mistaking it for a googly or when he played a googly mistaking it for a legbreak. He discovered that if he bowled straight, a batsman playing either for the googly or the leg break could be foxed. Consequently, his leg breaks never turned. He had a variation- the deadly flipper which was bowled with the same action as the leg break and didn't turn. In fact, it was identical to the leg break in all respects, except that he called it a flipper. To understand how this enabled him to get wickets, one should remember again that Kumble was one of the cleverst cricketers to have played the game. Having read in his childhood how Clarie Grimett used to snap his fingers, thus leading to the impression that he had bowled a flipper, and then bowl a leg break, Kumble used to do the same. The batsmen, having read the Grimett story themselves, would realise that Kumble was bowling the leg break while pretending to bowl the flipper. Howeve, since they also knew that the two were the same, this paradox would so confuse them that they would be dazed for a while. One second of indecision against Kumble would of course be deadly. Kumble's moment of glory came when he took 10 wickets in an innings against Pakistan. The umpiring decisions were all correct, though one of them, that of Akram being given out leg before wicket when Younis was in fact the batsman facing, is sometimes debated. On Indian tracks against lefthanders in the second innings, Kumble was deadly, especially if the track had stones planted on it at crucial spots. He used to call them 'his precious stones.\" Kumble is particularly noted for his dive. The dive was always like the rotation of the windmill which allows the wind to pass through. Stopping the ball was never the priority. After all, why risk getting injured when the whole team depended on you? Never one to stand in the way of young talent, Kumble has decided to call it a day when people ask why and not why not. In an announcement that made his sacrifice and quest towards perfection abundantly clear, he said in a recenrt conference that he would retire after taking eleven wickets in an innings. When a journalist reminded him that it had never happened so far, he said that that was precisely the reason why he wanted to be the first to do it. Since he had taken 10 wickets in an innings once, he hoped to be able to replicate the feat, since everyone knew that No. 11 was the easiest to get out. His logic was as sharp as ever. Acareer that started with a paradox has ended in one- people wonder how this gentle giant, this non-spinning spinner can simultaneously be the proud master of world cricket while being a humble servant of Indian cricket. Such are the questions that this cricketer who had all the answers will leave for us. All said and done, Kumble is undoubtedly the finest spinner to ever play cricket and the second best leg spinner India has ever produced. Venkatesh Prasad Prasad had a fascination for the theory of relativity and spent his career examining whether there was a lower limit for speed. The speed at which Prasad bowled has now been accepted as the lowest possible velocity possible. Prasad had a very good record against many batsmen, especially the ones he had never bowled to. Among batsmen he did bowl to, Gary Kirsten was his bunny. It all started when Prasad bowled Gary Kirsten in the second innings with a ball he bowled in the South African first innings. Kirsten was so bamboozled by this incident that he used to quake in his boots when facing Prasad later on. Kirsten said once that facing Prasad was his most educative experience on the Cricket field, since he used to read the autobiographies of famous batsmen when waiting for the ball to arrive. He claimed to have read more books in this fashion than in his entire life outside the stadium. Frequently, Prasad bowled so slow that all six of his balls in the over were in the air at the same time. This enabled India to take 6 new balls. This was his primary contribution to the team and the reason why his slow ball was considered to be such an asset. Prasad's batting was less of an asset. In fact, he was such a horrible batsmen that even net bowlers refused to bowl to him, saying they'd rather bowl at the stumps without a batsman. To improve his batting credentials without taking recourse to any other bowler having to bowl at him, he devised the unique training regimen of bowling in the morning, having lunch and a siesta and returning late afternoon to face the balls that he had bowled in the morning. His batting against himslef improved by leaps and bounds. However, facing himself was hardly the ideal preparation to face any bowler who bowled faster than a lethargic snail and consequently, his batting at the international stage hardly showed any signs of improvement. He worked on his fielding to make up, and toward the end of his career, so improved his fielding that he was able to reach as close to any ball in the outfield as possible without actually being near enough to stopping it. This gave Indian cricket its second enduring image of the 90s along with the Kumble dive, that of the ball crossing the boundary and Prasad running past it just after the nick of time. The distance between him and the ball has now been accepted by physicists as the shortest distance possible. After a glorious few years, Prasad lost his place in the side when the selectors found out that the years had taken their toll and that he had lost his lack of pace. He announced his retirement when his bowling slowed down so much that he had diffulty in getting the ball to come out of his hand. Ajit Agarkar Agarkar is the only cricketer to have his biography started during his playing career. However, the book is yet to be finished because a chapter on three reasons why he's not a total waste as a cricketer is still not completed even after three months of it having been started. Agarkar is an animal and bird lover with a particular liking for ducks. Ateam mate challenged him to eat duck for five meals in a row. He lost the bet, but made amends on the cricket field. Widely panned for being short and wide all the time, he once bowled eighty balls without even one being short and wide. This was particularly impressive when you consider that all of them were either short or wide. He went for 137 runs, but not before he had demonstrated his point. As a bowler, his variety was bewildeing. His arsenal included bouncers outside off and down leg, full tosses, overpitched deliveries, noballs and wides. He is the only bowler to have achieved the quadruple (the feat of bowling at least one wide each down leg side and outside off stump to both lefties and righties in the same match) 50 times. He used to practise with a red carpet laid out on the entire pitch. He used to be able to pitch the ball anywhere outside the carpet at will, in keeping with the great traditions of Indian fast bowlers. This used to be called Agarkar's red carpet welcome to batsmen. Sachin Tendulkar Though considered to be among the modern greats, Sachin Tendulkar has many weaknesses. For example, he is particularly susceptible against fast bowling. Once, Shoaib Akhtar bowled him with a ball faster than the speed of light. Some attributed this to the fact that at those speeds, the mass of the ball becomes infinite, making it impossible to play. Sachin himself came up with the lamest of excuses saying that he had been unable to spot the ball. His second weakness is a complete inability to play the unplayable ball. But causing most concern to his fans is that he looks totally lost against both Shane Warne's doosra and Murali's googly. In the Adelaide Test match of 2003-2005, Murali bowled him thrice in an innings with a googly. Warne went one better by taking a rare hattrick- he had Sachin bowled, lbw and caught in the deep all in one ball. Tendulkar's other main weaknesses are listed below: 1. Can't play spin 2. Can't play left arm medium pace 3. Can't play incoming ball from the right hand medium pacer 4. Can't play outgoing balls from the right hand medium pacer 5. Can't play short/full length balls/ yorkers. Also, he has a tendency to be caught behind when playing on the off side, lbw when playing on the legside and bowled when playing straight. It is a mystery how he has scored so many runs, one that has baffled analysts for long. He cannot play under pressure- his matchwinning innings at Sharjah were due to the fact that a sand storm had reduced the atmospheric pressure. Contrary to poplular belief, he did not play well in the crucial World Cup Match against Pakistan- the Pakistani players are even worse under pressure. Tendulkar has had a colourful career. His contests with leading bowlers have made compelling viewing though most of them have got the better of him, sometimes using unconventional methods. Famously, McGrath came up with the ace strategy of bowling to him with an invisible ball. Tendulkar had no answer to that delivery which McGrath insists was an inswinger and was trapped in front of the stumps. It was a victory for the bowler, who prior to the delivery had asked Tendulkar to hit it if he could. Umpire Buckner was involved in this controversial dismissal. In his autobiography, \"Alaw unto himself\", he mentions that that \"Tendulkar played down the wrong line\", was \"palpably plumb\" and that that was \"the best ball that he had never seen.\" Tendulkar's bowling has proved to be very useful. He counts Inzy Ul Haq among his bunnies, so fact which was immortalised in a recent newspaper heading, \"End-UL-HAQ kar?\" Such complimentary headings cannot hide the fact that Tendulkar has himself been the bunny of many bowlers- McGrath dismissed him 540 times, which forms a major proportion of his 500 Test wickets. Razzaq, Pollock and Kumble have also had a lot of success against him at the international level. Surprisingly, Buckner has dismissed him more number of times than even McGrath. What is stunning has been that Buckner has dismissed him in every way possible- many times lbw, equally as many times caught behind, a couple of times for obstructing the non striker, thrice for handling the bat, four times for obstructing the sun, seven times bat before wicket, twice for running on the pitch and once for beating Lara to 10,000 runs. Buckner has also given him out once, since he predicted that he would show dissent when being given out. Tendulkar promptly protested, thus completely vindicating Buckner's decision. In addition, he has also got him out in modes that are too ridiculous to be discussed here. Ravi Shastri Ravi Shastri once played an innings so glittering that that led Edison to invent the bulb. This was when he hit a 100 in 20 balls against Germany. The last 50 runs were particularly breathtaking and came off just 35 balls. Shastri was the first to complete the all rounder's double of clean bowling himself 510 times and hitting 100 sixes of his own bowling. He was such a supreme all rounder that he frequently used to clean bowl himself and hit a six off himself off the same ball- a feat that was unheard of till then. However, he soon found that he was the ideal spin bowler. This discovery was made when he once pitched a ball outsde the stadium and turned it so much that it hit off stump. Another time, called on to break an opening partnership between Shoaib Malik and Imran Farhat that was assuming threatening proportions, he did the unthinkable. He got so much drift with his very first delivery and gave it so much flight that the ball pitched in the dressing room and dismissed Inzy, who was due to bat one down, leg before wicket. That magic ball left Pakistan reeling at 735/1 without either opener having been dismissed. Such an instance had never happened before in the annals of cricket and has never happened since. Umpire David Shepherd later wrote that it was \"absolutelty plumb\", saying it would have \"gone on to clip leg stump\". On a dead pitch not offering much turn, it was a sterling effort. As a spinner, he had it all- flight, loop, turn, bite, bounce, drift, nip and real purchase off the wicket. The amount of turn he extracted meant that the wicketkeeper had to field at point most of the time. He got so much purchase off the wicket that he used to finish all his shopping during the match. As a batsman, he was also a proponent of the SPCB movement- Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Balls. He used to charge down the track and defend balls with a dead bat. He used to see the ball early and play it late- so much so that he sometimes saw the ball before the bowler bowled it and played it after it hit the stumps. Though a defensive player at times, he could drive beautifully- especially when he wasn't drunk. This explains why he was given a car in the World Championship of Cricket in 1985. Rajk Rajk started off as a fast bowler who used to run so fast when delivering the ball that the momentum took him past the stumps in his follow through, and the wicket keeper had to catch him before he reached the boundary. He remains the only player to be caught behind regularly off his own bowling. This sight was so arresting that he frequently forgot to deliver the ball and batsmen forgot to play the undelivered ball, thus getting out to him. Later, he switched to leg spin bowling and would have played for India but for Kumble's arrival on the scene, much like Rajinder Goel and Bedi. He was hammered by any factor and hampered by many factors. He bowled with a Tennis ball, which made drift very hard to obtain. He compensated for this by judicious use of the seam. Secondly, he bowled on pitches fields where the tracks were not conducive to spin bowling. But the biggest hurdle was unimaginative captaincy. Not realising that attacking spinners were bound to be hit around a bit, captains immediately took him off the attack after conceding 50 runs from 2 overs. Also a spectacular fielder, he once ran 100 metres and with the match delicately poised, took a stunning one handed catch diving forward at full stretch, only to realise that he had run into the adjoining field and caught a catch when they were practising high catches before the game. The unltimate compliment came from Tendulkar, who said that \"Rajk was without doubt the best legspinner to never play the game.\" Javagal Srinath The toughest five balls he bowled were the ones he bowled wide off the off stump so that Kumble could pick up the last wicket after he had taken nine wickets against Pakistan. For an accurate bowler like him, it would have been near impossible. He relished the challenge so much that he bowled similar balls throughout his career afrter that. Such was his control that he used to practise with a hanky on the pitch on a good length spot and not hit it throughout practice, even if he bowled 10000 balls. This proves the awesome variety of his bowling. Saurav Ganguly He famously hit an explosive hundred against SL in Taunton with so many sixes that the residents of the town thought they were being bombed. Towards the end of his career, Ganguly spent 20% of the time convincing the media that he'd never fought with Greg Chappell, 20% convincing them that he didn't have a problem with the short ball, and 60% convincing them that he'd never fought with Greg Chappel about having a problem with the short ball. The remaining time he spent in improving his rapport with the coach and comfort factor against the short ball. His inclusion/exclusion in the team was used by scientists at the University of Michigan as the starting point for random number generation. It is said that Dravid used to carry a coin around with him and toss it to determine whether Ganguly should play or not. His career ended when Greg Chappel suggested a new system whereby the coin was substituted by two dice. If the sum of the two scores on rolling them was greater than 14, Ganguly would play. Ganguly also played soccer. Dravid had a high regard for Ganguly's abilities as a soccer player, once paying him the ultimate compliment- that if he played soccer with God, God would be off side first and then Ganguly. His natural instinct to kick the ball led to a large number of lbw dismissals while playing cricket. Awonderful defender, he could play on either wing. By an amazing coincidence, like in cricket, Ganguly alternated between being left out and being right back in soccer too. Rahul Dravid The great batsmen make fielders redundant by the brilliance of their stroke play. Dravid is the greatest of them all- he makes fielders redundant by refusing to play any shot. Most batsmen have no shot as their favourite. Dravid's favourite is no shot. While other batsmen would play bread and butter shots, he would offer none and hence got the nickname of \"Jammie\". He is a textbook cricketer- a champion at book cricket, which is also the only game where he ever scored more than two runs in one try. Dravid has always been a tough nut to crack for opposing captains. This is particularly true of one-day cricket where over the first half of his career, opposing captains worried themselves sick about how to get him out. However, he evolved as a batsman, like all champion cricketers do, and posed tougher questions towards the second half of his career when captains started losing sleep over how to not get him out, since they felt their best chance was to keep him at the crease. In an ODI final recently, when Dravid was caught at point, he had faced 60 balls and had a strike rate of 5. The captain, who desperately hoped that the fielder would drop the ball, promptly admonished the fielder saying that \"You've just caught the World cup, my son.\" Dravid is famous for knowing where his offstump is. Once, when Lee had sent his offstump cartwheeling out of the ground, he was able to locate it in the crowd because he still knew where his off stump was. Dravid's batting is built on sound fundamentals and the simple strategy of boring the bowler to death and putting the fielders to sleep. He then attempts to find the gaps between them. Dravid is so strong on the leg side that 0-12 fields are frequently employed to stop him. He plays the swivel pull beautifully- eyes on the ball, rocking back, judging the length early. It is a shot of great beauty, especially in the rare instances when he succeeds in making contact with the ball too. Dravid's batting philosophy in Tests is simple. Give the first 90 overs each day to the bowler, see out even the horrible balls and and then look to dominate. This is not because of a limited repertoire of shots. He had all the shots in the book, but never plays even one in the interest of the team. Wisden, talking about his debut innings, remarked that \"Dravid, a compulsive leaver of the ball, played an innings so breathtaking that it was supposed to be the best innings by him in England till then\" and added that \"so pretty was the innings that it was even prettier than Ganguly's cherubic face when he was in a deep slumber at the non-striker's end. Fielders stood rooted to the ground, maybe because they figured out they weren't required since no shot was being played. Some say that they were actually in a stupor induced daze. It is even rumoured that a couple were sleepwalking.\" He frequently dropped anchor, doing to the team's score what an anchor does to a ship. But his finest hour was an innings that is still talked off with awe by people fortunate enough to see it. India were in a crisis as usual. In an innings of vintage class, Dravid showcased his superb defensive technique- getting in line with the ball and playing it with a still head and a dead bat. He proceeded to do this ball after ball, six times in a row. So complete was his mastery that he even defended balls which were wide outside off and down leg, which would have been called wides. It was such an astonishing display under the circumstances that even the fielding team purportedly patted him on the back after the over. Nothing- not even the docile nature of the track, the utter ineffectiveness of the bowling or the fact that India required 24 runs in 12 balls at the beginning of that over- could shake his resolve. He was a batsman well and truly in the zone. Sadly, Tendulkar, uninspired by such mastery of defence, chickened out and took the easy way out by hitting the last six balls for four. As ever, in a country that refuses to acknowledge any other batsman, all the plaudits went to him."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "posted by Rajk @ 12:43 AM 7 comments"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Tuesday, August 15, 2006"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Business to back"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Why haven't Iposted?

But for good measure, Iadded, \"Even though lying down is good for you, if you attack my dedication to work, Iwon't take it lying down.\" This was followed by a polite laugh, just so that he wouldn't take that as a threat. He didn't. With a dreamy look in his eyes, he said he'd been looking for somebody to assist him in an ambitious endeavour. That was the beginning of how Igot lumbered with this tough assignment, which has kept me busy for the past few days. I've been busy over the first few days of the past few days watching grass grow and watching paint dry. The two were meant to prepare myself for the last undertaking. Those were not particularly candidates for the most exciting days of my life. Between the two, watching paint dry was more satisfying, if you get my drift. Imean, you can't be certain whether the grass has grown and all that, but with paint you can be sure. And then Igot my assignment. The mail said- \"Discuss urgently: Dodo.\" The first line he spoke to me when Imet him was, \"Congrats! You've been chosen to spot a Dodo.\" \"Adodo? But... a dodo hasn't even been spotted for a long time. Ibelieve they're extinct\", Isaid, shocked. He said that that was the challenge of the whole thing. It was not a big deal, he said, spotting a crow, for example, but a dodo represented an opportunity. That's why I'd been handpicked to do it. Good logic, that was. But Icouldn't stand around appreciating it. Ihad dodos to spot. Itook the bull by the horns. With trepidation, Iset out for my vantage point. The first day was pretty bad. Itried to get a dekko of a Dodo and failed. The second day was worse. Itried and failed again. The third day... well, Iguess you can take it from there. So Iwent back to him and told him that Ididn't think I'd be able to do it. \"Iknew it\", he said, grinning. Iwanted to say Iknew it too. But the thought crossed my mind for a second whether the whole thing wasn't unfair. Imean say you know something's impossible, why would you ask somebody to do it? Only for a second mind you. Because the second second was taken up by absorbing what he was trying to say next. \"Iwant you to collect material on the dodo on an emergency basis. Basically, we want to be ready in case we're attacked by dodos. Ihave reasons to believe that this is highly probable in the distant future.\" So Iwent about trying to do that. You won't believe the kind of resistance Iencountered when Itried to do that. People said they'd never even seen a Dodo. Isaid that's why it was an emergency. Imean if you haven't even seen a dodo, what chance have you when something happens, say when you're attacked by a million dodos? But that didn't convince anybody. So Iwent back to my boss and told him Iwas convinced it was impossible to convince a soul. \"Impossible is nothing, is impossible\" , he mumbled. \"Ididn't get that', Isaid, furiously scratching my head. \"Oh, sorry. That's a board room hangover. Now that the Adidas punchline is fashionable, Idon't know whether to say impossible is nothing or nothing is impossible. So Itake no chances\", he said, with a wicked grin. \"But this statement doesn't make any sense.\", Itried arguing. \"Hey, it's used only in corporate meetings, ok.\" Good logic. Can't argue with that. Anyway, he said I'd been chosen to stretch the frontiers of the human spirit. The chapter entitled \"Anti-dodo enabling\" was to be written by me. \"Icreated the whole thing\", he said proudly. \"There was no such chapter initially. Talk about lack of foresight\", he said, chuckling. That's how Istarted work on the chapter. Imean that sounded like a huge thing to do, stretching the frontiers and all that. My boss kept giving me weird feedback. Once, he said that Ihad talent as a comic writer, an addition to what Ithought was a considerable list of talents. \"If you write stuff like this, people will laugh at you.\" That's exactly what he said. Talk of oblique compliments. It took me a long time, this chapter did, but now Iam, as Isaid, over and done with it. This presents with infinite possibilities when schmoozing in the office and listening to colleagues boasting about their achievements. For example, Ioverheard the following conversation the other day: \"I've increased sales in the southeastern part of northwestern Siberia by 0.04%. You?\" , said braggart 1. \"Ibrought about a 300% increase in the sale of a water purifier in the middle of the Sahara desert. \", said braggart 2. \"Iincreased sales of antiperspirants in the arctic by infinity', said braggart 3. \"How did you do that?\", asked braggart 1, enviously, incredulously. \"Ididn't even go there. Ijust made a receipt and paid the money myself. We never sold any stuff out there. So you see, I've increased the sales by a factor of infinity. I'll get a very large bonus which more than covers the cost of the stuff, which Ipaid for. Not to mention how happy my boss was. Everyone wins.\" He thought he was a dead cert to win that one. Fat chance. He reckoned without me. Choosing my moment, Iburst on the scene with the coup de grâce: \"Huh, I've anti-Dodo-enabled the company. Frankly, what good is any of you?\" Braggart 1, braggart 2 and braggart 3 shrank away quickly into the oblivion of their cubicles with a mixture of hopelessness and apprehension. The little pleasures of life, to see your colleagues running scared of you. So well, we're anti- Dodo enabled. Some people working in other companies heard this and were scared because they didn't know what it meant. One guy hadn't heard even of what a Dodo was. And us? We're anti-Dodo attack enabled. Iget awfully excited when somebody mentions the word \"Dodo.\" The other day, Ijumped up and shouted \"Where, where?\" when my colleague said something about dodos. It turned out that he was just remarking that something was as dead as a dodo. Itold him- \"You dud, you think Dodos are dead?\", and he replied, \"You dumbo, you think they're not?\" Ialmost felt like throwing him to the Dodos, to give him a scare, since they were herbivores, but you can't do that when you don't see them dodos in the first place, eh? Doesn't matter. It's just a matter of time. The dodos are coming. Idream of people reading the first line in my chapter sometime, \"Dodos: Do's, don'ts\". Iwhisper the first few lines of the chapter to myself in my sleep sometimes, \"The first don't is to avoid killing a dodo, whatever be the provocation, be it even that it is trying to kill you. This is because dodos are extinct and we can't afford to kill any more of them. Also, dodos are prone to getting agitated very quickly, particularly if they have just been killed. So killing them will only exacerbate the situation if the dodo was agitated to start with ...\" Yes, Ivery much dream of a flock of dodos attacking the company and our repelling them all effortlessly. It's thrilling. It really is."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "posted by Rajk @ 11:41 PM 3 comments"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Friday, November 18, 2005"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Love, love me do"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Sarah braced herself up.

And this has been some series. The last day means that drama has followed drama and a gut-wrenching final hour of the Test another similar one at Edgbaston as England strained every sinew to break the Australian resistance. Australia were eventually saved by a combination of grits, luck, and do not forget, weather. It's a series that has had everything. This match had both captains returning to batting form. It also must have had Terry Alderman, the former Australian swing bowler, wondering whether he will be accused of abetting the Aussie batsmen in suicide. Here is what he said of Giles before the series: \"Idefinitely believe if any of our batsmen get out to Giles in the Tests they should go and hang themselves. But I'm confident that won't happen.\" By a quirk of fate, Giles has got seven wickets and they have all been of top order batsmen. But the unbelievable fact is that they're all different. In other words, he’s snaffled each Aussie top order batter exactly once. It is as if the Gods wanted to join him in cocking a snook at the Aussies. Alderman's not the only one who got a prediction wrong. In fact, would there be anybody who'd predicted even a fraction of the excitement, the thrills and spills we've already seen? As the by now famous line goes, this has been the best Test since… Edgbaston, of course! There is no doubt as to which side played the better Cricket at Old Trafford. Any notions of an Australian superiority are as unfounded as a gazelle having a superiority complex because it has just escaped capture by a lion. England have their sights firmly set this time around. Australia have gone from the stalker to the stalked. What of this series? Where does it go now? Can it get better? It seems unlikely, but weren't we wrong when we thought the same thing at Edgbaston? The story of the match can’t be easily told, but there were similarities to the Edgbaston Test- England with a huge first innings total and the Aussies shot out cheaply. The difference from Edgbaston is that only one side could have won this Test. England are the more settled side, with every one of their batsmen having made a contribution and a bowling line up that has a settled look to it. Bell, Hoggard and Geriant Jones all made crucial contributions. Though Flintoff didn't have to swing the match England's way this time with  his bat, he did reverse swing it their way, ably helped by Simon Jones. Many Aussie batsmen looked clueless, not the least Katich and Clarke, both losing their stumps to some delightful reverse swing bowling. Ponting played a wonderful knock, as did Vaughan a few days before him. When he fell with four overs to go, it seemed likely that Harmison had dealt the killer blow. But as Iwatched the final few balls of the match (in a pub, and in an indescribably tense atmosphere), the suspicion dawned on me that Australia might just hold on by the skin of their teeth. So it proved, but were they made to sweat it out or what! There is the joy of the rebirth of the thrilling draw. Adraw, or the possibility of one, along with a loss, win and tie has always been one of Test cricket’s attractions. This is something that one day cricket will always be bereft of. This draw flies in the face of all who believe that a drawn test cannot be a compelling watch. There is also the joy of cricket’s rebirth in its native land, one that spurned it for football. Now, kicking the ball might take a back seat for a while at least while this battle captures the imagination of an entire nation. The Ashes, like England, have indeed risen from the ashes!"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "posted by Rajk @ 9:06 PM 0 comments"}]}

Ihope that it can serve future Computorians\nto write \"IT at CERN: its birth, its life ...\" - Miguel Marquina (editor)- 1. INTRODUCTION The origins of computing machinery can be traced back to 3000\nyears ago when the Chinese introduced a primitive form of abacus,\nor 300 years ago when Schickard, Pascal and Leibniz invented the\nfirst arithmetic machines. For us at CERN it all started 30 years\nago when one of the first electronic digital computers, a huge\nFerranti Mercury, was installed. It was the beginning of a success\nstory which has changed the way to do physics and, as a matter of\nfact, to do any work at all in the Laboratory. The story goes on and the changes brought in by the new\ninformation technologies continue to affect us at an astonishing\nrate. Those who witnessed the beginning of the information era were\nconscious of the potential impact of those mar marvellous machines\non Physics as well as on Society, but they could hardly imagine\nwhat was to come. In retrospect, we can say that the 30 years which\nseparate us from the days of those first generation machines, have\nbeen years of struggle, of sweat and tea tears, of doubt and of\npainful reappraisal, but also years of discovery, of excitement, of\nachievement and of pride to the actors in this unique\nadventure. Of those 30 CERN years, Imissed only the first three. Idid not\nmiss, however, the joys of programming first generation machines,\nalthough in a different environment. Actually, when Ijoined CERN\nearly in 1962, the only machines around were still made out of\nvacuum tubes. Iam, therefore, rather well placed to tell my\npersonal account of the what, why and how of the evolution\nof automatic computing at CERN. Ishall not even attempt to be exhaustive, let alone objective.\nIshall tell the story as Isaw it, or rather as Ilived it.\nInstead of compressing 262800 hours into 1, Ishall select and\nreport only those events which, in my opinion, are either real\nmilestones or make an interesting story, and Ishall follow them\nthrough to their consequences, even if this means breaking the\nstrict chronological order. The basic features of the large\nhigh-performance systems which have played a major role in the CERN\nComputer Center are listed in Appendix\n1 . 2. THE BIG BANG It took six days for God to build the Universe and a little over\ntwo years for the Ferranti engineers to produce our Mercury ,\na large assembly of complex circuitry hidden inside a row of\naustere cabinets, making few concessions ons to people's curiosity.\nAt about the same time the PS was built in five years and today one\ncan build accelerators 1000 times more powerful, always in about\nfive years. The Mercury was 1000 times less powerful (16.6 kHz)\nthan a modern personal computer which is now mass-produced by\nrobotized assembly lines at the rate of 2 or 3 per minute! The purchasing contract was signed on the 25th of May, 1956 and\nstipulated that the machine with 1024 40-bit words of fast [ 120 microsec to read/write one word from the\naccumulator] core store and a slow [8.75 msec\nlatency] drum store having a total capacity of 16384\nwords of 40 binary digits, would be shipped to CERN in early\nFebruary 1957 and installation shall be completed by 1st May,\n1957.... The details of the progress of manufacture will be\nsubmitted at intervals of one month. The Mercury had a clock\ncycle of 60 microsec. It took 180 microsec to add and 300 microsec\nto multiply two long words of 40 bits. It had floating point\narithmetic. Division, however, had to be programmed. It is\ninteresting to note the absence of the word software from\nthe contract, the only relevant mention being: any programs and\nsub-routines which Ferranti will prepare will be made available to\nCERN free of charge. Unbundling and licensing were unknown\nin the 50's. The computer actually arrived during the summer of 1958 and passed the acceptance tests in October of that year. Following\nits successful introduction, a thick file of orders revealed the\nurgent need for spare valves and of tape bins (a critical\ndevice in those days of punched paper tape input/output!). At the end of 1958, the availability of a programming language\ncalled Autocode , attracted the first users to\nthe computer centre and marked the beginning of the 30 years of\ncomputing covered by this paper. It is interesting to note that the\nfirst Mercury Autocode compiler was written in 1956\n(by R. A. Brooker), two years before the appearance of the first FORTRAN compiler! It had many features which appeared later\nin FORTRAN. Due to memory limitations, variable names were\nrestricted to a single alphabetic character (5-bit Ferranti code).\nIt is worth noting that in the mid 50's the European computer\nindustry was still competitive. As far as competence, innovative\nideas and successful products are concerned, European companies\nlike Ferranti, English Electric and Elliott in England, Telefunken in Germany and Bull in France had little to envy their American\ncompetitors (e.g. ERA/Remington Rand, NCR, IBM ). The\nsize and the drive of the American market were, however, going to\nmake the difference quite rapidly in the 60's. The reasons behind the decision to acquire a Mercury were\ntechnical, political and financial. Technically the Mercury was\ndefinitely one of the most advanced machines around. It was\nconsidered superior to the Ferranti Pegasus, to the Elliott 404, to\nthe English Electric 'Deuce', to the Bull 'Gamma 311' and to\ndrum-type machines like the IBM 650. Ferranti was set up to produce\na dozen units and CERN was going to get serial number 6. The fact\nthat Harwell and Saclay had ordered Mercury's was given a certain\nweight. CERN had no experience in electronic digital computers and\nit was better to be part of a club of users. As to the price (one\nmillion Swiss Francs), it was five times cheaper than equivalent\nAmerican machines like the ERA 1101. Discussions went on for several months at CERN in 1955 and 1956.\nExternal experts were involved. Fifteen years after Konrad Zuse's\nrelay-based Z3 considered by many as the first general purpose\ncomputer, ten years after the electronic ENIAC, and six years after\nMaurice Wilkes' EDSAC, people were still debating on the virtues of\nbinary versus decimal machines, on the importance of floating point\narithmetic, on the size of words (the Z3 had 22-bit and the EDSAC\n32-bit words; the ENIAC was a decimal machine with 10 digits\nwords. The size of central memory was 64 words for the Z3, 2n for\nthe ENIAC and 512 for the EDSAQ, and on the best way to input and\noutput data (punched film, 5-7-8 channels papertape, or cards).\nPractical problems had to do with the unreliability of the\nhardware, the organization of the operations and the recruitment of\nexperts. Obsolescence was already a problem. CERN decided that the machine should be purely binary, that\n32-bit words were too short, and that the speed should be as high\nas possible (in particular multiplication time should be under a\nmillisecond). It also concluded that the speed and size of\nmemory were very important (several tens of thousands of binary\ndigits were a clear necessity), while the availability of\nfloating point hardware was considered a very desirable,\nalthough not quite indispensable, feature of a scientific\ncomputer. But what really makes it worthwhile to have a\nmachine, is the enthusiasm for carrying out the most difficult\ncomputations, as an American physicist put it in a letter\ndescribing his experience with a digital computer or 'the\ncourage to go ahead and solve problems which would have seemed too\ndifficult to do otherwise.' The computers of that time had colorful names like ILLIAC at the\nUniversity of Illinois, AVIDAC at Argonne, MANIAC, UNIVAC, etc...\nMost of them were prototypes. Everything was very much\nexperimental. The operations arrangements at the ILLIAC were\ndescribed as follows: 'The user deposits his punched paper tape\nin a box with instructions or the operator. The operator takes\nthese tapes, and inserts them in the machine in turn. If the code\nis correct, the machine delivers the answers and these may be\npicked up by the user the next morning. If there are errors in the\ncode, the operator carries out the test routines requested and the\nresults of these tests are deposited so that these may be reviewed\nby the user the next morning. Thus, the whole operation of the\nmachine becomes a fairly automatic affair'. This was more or\nless the style adopted for our operations thirty years ago. One of the first applications at CERN was the analysis of the\npapertape produced by the Instruments for the Evaluation of\nPhotographs (IEPs), used to scan and measure bubble chamber film.\nThe first reports convey a certain deception due to the slow tape\nread/write speed. Since everything had to go through the\naccumulator, the CPU was blocked during I/0. It was immediately\nclear that there was a big mismatch between the power of the\ncomputing engine and its input/output capability. After some struggling with faulty tubes, tape bins, machine\ninstructions and Autocode , people with lots of data\ndiscovered the existence of an IBM 704 in Paris, which offered\nsignificant advantages such as magnetic tape units, card\nreaders, line printers and FORTRAN! FORTRAN II allowed\n6-characters variable names and, most important, it simplified the\nexchange of programs with Berkeley and Brookhaven. The 1959 CERN\nAnnual Report indicated already that as the needs\nincrease, it will be necessary to envisage the replacement of the\nMercury by a more powerful system. It was also quickly realized\nthat these so-called electronic brains required quite a lot of\nhuman effort to be effectively exploited. Hence the proposal to\ndouble in 1960 the computer center staff (from 10 to 20). So, by the end of the 50's, the fundamental forces, sociological\nand technological, characteristic of every computer service, had\nbeen discovered, including the illusion that upgrading the\nresources would solve all the problems and achieve the ultimate\ngoal, i.e. make the users happy! 3. THE LESSONS OF THE EARLY 60'S The next big news was the arrival of the IBM 709, an\nimproved version of the 704, in January 1961. It was still a clumsy\nvacuum tube machine but it featured FORTRAN and all those fancy\nperipherals apt to improve the quality of life . The word length was 36 bits, the characters became 6-bit BCD,\nand the core memory size jumped to 32K. The CPU was 4-5 times\nfaster than that of the Mercury. However, to compile a typical\nFORTRAN program could take several minutes! Tape bins made way\nfor card trays. Magnetic tape units read and wrote at 75 ips on 7\ntracks and the density was 200 bpi. Peripherals were attached via\ntheir controllers to data channels. It was a significant advance in\nthat it allowed as many as six peripheral devices to access core\nmemory buffers while the CPU performed other work. Another\nimportant device which came with the 709 was the so-called Direct\nData Connection, allowing for direct transmission of data from\nexternal equipment to memory via a channel. The speed was not\nridiculous: in principle up to 1 Megabit/sec. The 709 was also\nequipped with one of the first interrupt systems. The bad news was still the poor reliability, although the\nprogress was already quite substantial. Unscheduled maintenance\nrepresented 11% of the total time. Scheduled maintenance took away\na time slice of similar size. So the down-time of the 709 compared\nnot too unfavorably with the up time of the very first electronic\ncomputers.... The on-line card reader and the printer did, however,\nslow down the operations considerably. After one year of experience\nCERN added a small IBM 1401, in order to speed up the input/output,\nthe job sequencing and the operations. The concept of SPOOLing\n(Simultaneous Peripheral Operation On-Line) with its 1/0 files\n(virtual reader/printer) has its origins in those days. Programming\nfor the 709 was considered a difficult activity to be left to the\nspecialists who could understand and keep up-to-date with the new\ntechniques and the operating conventions. The machine was an\nexpensive resource which had to be used efficiently. To give an\nidea, the list price was in the region of ten millions francs\n(1960 Swiss francs!). In those days a magnetic tape cost 60 $\n(some 260 SF!). It was at that time that the first inescapable\ncommittees appeared, e.g. Computer Scheduling Committee,\nComputer Users Advisory Committee and the Data Handling Policy\nGroup. The Mercury had still its faithful users but suffered from the\nchronic lack of modern, fast peripherals. In 1962, as part of a\nlifting operation, it was enhanced by the connection of an Ampex\ntape unit, compatible with IBM specifications and operating\nat 3333 characters per second (over 3 times the speed of the\nfastest paper tape reader and some 20 times faster than a tape\npunch). Also, two papertape-to-card converters were installed to\nease the transfer of data from the Mercury to the 709. By the\nend of 1962 it was possible to read the paper tape from IEPs into\nthe Mercury, give it a first processing pass, write the results\non magnetic tape and input it onto the IBM 709 for further\nanalysis. The first application packages appeared at that time,\ne.g. THRESH and GRIND used for the geometrical reconstruction and\nkinematic analysis of bubble chamber events. It is amusing to note\nthat, in spite of the growing workload and the frantic development\nof codes, the machines were normally switched off at weekends. But\nthe practice of 24 hours/day, 7-days/week service was around the\ncorner. It is also in interesting to realize that things like the\nconnection of the Ampex tape unit to the Mercury were entirely\ndesigned and implemented on site. The next problem was how to use all those Autocode programs on the 709. One just wrote an Autocode compiler for the 709. The difficulties of developing software were\nsoon to be learned. The first Conference recognizing the existence\nof a software crisis was held in Munich in 1968. Why is software\nalways late and unreliable? People working today with modern CASE\n(Computer Assisted Software Engineering) or OOP (Object Oriented\nProgramming) tools are still trying to solve the problem. But the\nanswer in those days was: better programming languages . CERN FORTRAN was defined to ensure compatibility with other\nlaboratories and facilitate portability of codes. It was felt,\nhowever, that FORTRAN was used mainly for historical reasons and new, more powerful languages would be needed to fully exploit\nthe potential of the electronic computer. As we all know, CERN was\nnot affected by, or it missed completely, the language explosion\nwhich started in the early 60's. ALGOL, Lisp, PL/I, PASCAL, Modula\nII, ADA, C, PROLOG, etc... did not raise above the level of\nminority cultures. FORTRAN evolved through its versions II, IV, 66,\n77, 8X, and it still dominates the CERN programming landscape. It took some time to saturate the 709, but it was already clear\nthat young physicists were becoming addicted. It was at that time\nthat the first embryonic Operating System appeared under the name\nof FORTRAN Monitor System. Many other important events occurred\nin the early 60's, such as the connection of computers on-line to\nfilm measuring devices including the very fast automatic flying\nspot digitizers (HPD, Luciole, etc..) forerunners of the modern\nimage digitizers and the first attempts to connect computers\ndirectly to experimental equipment (on-line experiments). The IBM\n709 was operated on-line to an HPD to measure both bubble and spark\nchamber films. In September 1963 the 709 was replaced by a 7090, a transistorized version of the same machine, about four\ntimes more powerful. It was at that time that the investments and the efforts started\nto pay off. Over 300 000 frames of spark chamber film were\nautomatically scanned and measured in record time using an HPD\nFlying Spot Digitizer on-line to the 7090. At about the same time\ncomputers were connected on-line to experiments to monitor the\nequipment and to collect digital data from the first filmless\ndetectors (e.g. sonic spark chambers) onto magnetic tape. The first\nsuccessful demonstrations with fully auto automatic digital pattern\nrecognition showed that computers could be programmed to replace\nslow human operators in a variety of tasks. Stories about computers\ndoing things faster, better and more reliably than human beings got\naround producing the usual mixture re of emotional reactions. In\n1970 the European Physics Society held a Conference at CERN on the\n'Impact of Computers on Physics' and Iremember the reassuring\nstatement of an eminent physicist that 'so far computers have not\nsignificantly contributed to any discovery'. It was going to take\nanother decade to see the HEP community wholeheartedly accepting\nthe computer as a critical component of their research and\nadmitting it to their current technological foundation trilogy: accelerators, detectors and computers. 1970 was also the year when the 'CERN Computing and Data\nHandling School' was launched to educate young physicists and\nstimulate the sharing of computing experience between high-energy\nphysicists and computer scientists. It turned out to be an\nexcellent idea. The School is still alive and well, fulfilling a\nclear need. As to the cross-fertilization across the\nphysics/computer science boundary, it has developed into an ideal\npartnership. Actually the two disciplines have influenced each other from the\nvery beginning. It was the physicist Bruno Rossi who built the\nfirst logic circuits which then were developed into computer\nhardware, and physicists have always been among the most\ndemanding consumers of computer cycles. Enrico Fermi, when asked in\nthe early fifties which research project would he recommend to the\nyoung Italian physicists, told them to design and build a computer.\nIndeed, physics research could not have become what it is without\nthe computer, and conversely, the development of the computer has\nbeen deeply influenced by the needs and vision of basic\nresearch. The study of the fundamental properties of elementary matter\ninvolves the frontiers of human knowledge and pushes the technology\nto the limit of what is possible. Computer scientists have been\nplaying with models and formalisms, architectures and languages,\ninventing tools and methodologies of a rather theoretical nature\nand they have been sometimes accused of developing general\nsolutions in search of specific problems. When a dense problem\nspace meets a rich solution space some good news can be\nexpected... Evidence of synergistic effects has been accumulating\never since the beginning of the information era. High-energy\nphysics and information technology are among those disciplines\nwhich, in the second half of our century, have shown the most\nimpressive advances. Appendix 1 (part 1) All the major computers having served in the CERN Computer\nCentre in the period 1958-1988 are listed in chronological order,\ntogether with some configuration details and their characteristic\nfeatures. FERRANTI 'Mercury' [1958-1965] First generation vacuum tube machine (60 microsec clock\ncycle, 2 cycles to load or store, 3 cycles to add and 5 cycles to\nmultiply 40 bit longwords, no hardware division) with magnetic core\nstorage (1024 40-bit words, 120 microsec access time). Mercury's\nprocessor had floating point arithmetic and a B-Register (index\nregister). Magnetic drum auxiliary storage (16 Kwords of 40 bits,\n8.75 msec average latency, 64 longwords transferred per\nrevolution). Paper tape I/0. Two Ampex magtape units added in 1962. Autocode compiler. At the end of its career it was\nconnected on-line to an experiment (Missing Mass Spectrometer). In\n1966 the Mercury was shipped to Poland as a gift to the Academy of\nMining and Metallurgy at Cracow. IBM 709 [1961-1963] Vacuum tube machine ( 12 microsec clock cycle, 2 cycles to\nadd and 15 on average to multiply 36 bit integers, hardwired\ndivision and floating point arithmetic, index registers) with core\nstorage (32 Kwords of 36 bits, 24 microsec access time). Card\nreader (250 cpm) and card punch (100 cpm). Line printer. Magtape\nunits (7 tracks, 75 ips, 200 bpi). Introduction of the Data\nChannel. FORTRAN compiler. FORTRAN Monitor System. IBM 7090 [1963-1965] Transistorized second-generation machine ( 2.18 microsec clock cycle) with core storage (32 Kwords of 36 bits, 4.36 microsec\naccess time). Card 1/0, Tape units (7 tracks, 112.5 ips, 200/556\nbpi). Eight Data Channels. Interrupt System. FORTRAN compiler.\nBasic Monitor Operating System (IBSYS). Connected on-line to Flying\nSpot Digitizers (HPD and Luciole) to measure bubble and spark\nchamber films. CDC 6600 [1965-1975] Serial Number 3 (pre-production series machine). Transistor\nmachine designed by Seymour Cray and very compact for its time. CPU\nclock cycle 100 nsec . Core memory: 128 Kwords of 60 bits.\nMemory access 1 microsec, but independent memory banks allowed for\nup to one access per clock cycle. Instruction prefetch. Ten\noverlapping functional units. Ten autonomous peripheral processor\nunits (PPU's) each with 4K of 12-bit words core memory. Huge disks\nover one meter in diameter holding 500 million bits. Tape Units\n(half inch tape, 7 tracks, 200, 556 and 800 bpi, and one inch tape,\n14 tracks, 800 bpi). High-speed card reader (1200 cpm). First multi-programmed machine in the Computer Centre. However,\nSIPROS multiprogramming operating system was abandoned by Control\nData. Basic SIPROS operating system had to be made at CERN. Then\nChippewa OS (COS) was installed. It evolved to SCOPE which was\neventually used after adapting it to CERN needs. This resulted in a\nnon-trivial amount of changes, thus deserving the renaming to CERN\nSCOPE. The 6600 was connected to various FSD systems and to two\non-line computers, the SDS920 and the IBM 1800, via CERN-made data\nlinks. In terms of processing capacity the 6600 was about three\nquarters of a CERN unit or ten times the 7090. The change-over from the IBM 7090 was planned to take three\nmonths starting in January 1965. Major engineering overhauls had to\nbe done instead during the first few years and ended up in a\ntwo-months shut-down in 1968 in order to modify the 6600 to\nincorporate logic and packaging improvements which had been\nintroduced in the production machines. During this long period of\nstruggling with hardware instabilities and software development and\nchanges, computing work was done partly by sending jobs to outside\ncomputers and partly by processing data on a CDC 3400, and later on\na 3800, temporarily made available at CERN by Control Data. CDC 3800 [1966-1968] The 3800 was a member of the 3000 series CDC family of\ncomputers, incompatible with the 6000 series machines. More\nconventional than the 6600, the 3800 had a 48-bit architecture. The\ncore memory (64 Kwords) was replaced by a faster one (800 nsec)\nduring its staying at CERN. This machine was eventually acquired by\nthe State of Geneva and installed at the local University. At CERN\nit was replaced by a CDC 6400. It is worth noting that CERN\nacquired other machines of the 3000 s series, e.g. a 3100 for the\nFOCUS project offering semi-interactive facilities and quick\nsampling of experimental data at the central computers, and a 3200\nfor interactive graphics applications."}]}

Iwant to talk about Bruce Schneier's new book Beyond Fear .      Bruce was nice enough to send me a copy back in May, when Iwrote about systematic errors in risk perception . Iread it in one big gulp, and ever since then I've been carrying it around in my briefcase, waiting to have enough time to write a review. Here it is. Bruce Schneier is a security expert who achieved his fame in the field of cryptography and Internet security and has subsequently branched out to write and consult about general security issues. Beyond Fear is his attempt to demystify security for the post-9/11 general public. His general thesis is that all security decisions, ranging from a homeowner's decision about whether to buy a burglar alarm to a government's decision about whether to spy on its own citizens, are based on the same general concepts. By understanding these concepts, we can make rational decisions about whether and how proposed security measures should be implemented, rather than being driven by fear. Schneier proposes a five-step process for evaluating any security measure: (1) What assets need to be protected? (2) What are the risks to these assets? (3) How well does the security solution mitigate those risks? (4) What other risks does the security solution cause? (5) What costs and tradeoffs does the security solution impose? Schneier models the five-step process in sidebars throughout the book, applying it to security decisions as diverse as \"should Iuse my credit card to make purchases over the Internet?\" and \"should Iinvade Iraq to protect my country from terrorism?\" The five steps seem simple, even obvious, but consider how often they're overlooked in public debate. For example, since 9/11 we have frequently been told by pundits that \"giving up a few rights is a small price to pay for safety,\" and have been encouraged to skim over inconvenient questions about how much safety we're actually getting for the price. Ifound two of Schneier's concepts particularly useful. First is the notion that everyone involved in a security decision has their own agenda, and that, as illustrated here , these agendas are often driven by factors unrelated to security – such as profit or PR or the need for people to feel safe. Non-security agendas aren't necessarily bad things. For example, Schneier points out that during the 2002 sniper attacks on the Washington DC area, many parents drove their children to school despite the fact that, statistically, the children were at greater risk of dying in a car accident than a sniper attack. Driving them to school was valuable because it provided emotional security, not because it increased their physical security. Schneier's point is not that non-security agendas must be eliminated, but that they must be understood - and not mistaken for real security factors. The other concept Ifound especially useful is that every security decision involves tradeoffs.  We can't decide to have \"no compromises\" when it comes to security, we can only decide where our compromises will be, who will bear the brunt of them, and how we will deal with them. Explicit discussion of security tradeoffs is often avoided, as anyone who's read the \"child safety\" sections of parenting magazines can attest. That makes it awfully difficult to reject proposed security measures. (\"Well, why wouldn't we want to do it, if it saves just one life... if there's the smallest chance...\") We can't make rational decisions about security without articulating and choosing among the associated tradeoffs. The first part of Beyond Fear outlines the basic principles of Schneier's approach to security decision-making. The second part of the book discusses specific elements of threats, attackers, defenses, and countermeasures (for example: \"Brittleness makes for bad security,\" \"Detection works where prevention fails\"), in short chapters filled with vivid real-world examples. Schneier's got a gift for logical exposition; reading this book, Ifrequently found myself saying \"how obvious!\" in response to a point Iknew had never occurred to me before. At the end of the book, Ifelt much more confident in my ability to understand security debates and participate intelligently in the discussion. Beyond Fear is beautifully organized, clearly expressed, and not the least bit dull.

It's frequently brought out as a pro-choice trump card: \"Well, what about children who would be born deformed and suffer terrible pain?\" Some people have made the paradoxical argument that disabled children have a \"right not to be born.\" There are, in fact, \"wrongful birth\" lawsuits. Yes, those are all about children who are much more disabled than me - but I've had friends over the years with osteogenesis imperfecta, with cerebral palsy, with spina bifida, with no arms and legs. Where on the continuum do you draw the line? The answers aren't easy, as this painful article makes clear. It also makes it clear that there are people who choose abortion because of disabilities that are much less severe than mine. Iused to say, \"Idon't have a problem with abortion on the basis of 'Idon't want to have a child right now,' Ihave a problem with abortion on the basis of 'Idon't want to have THIS child.' \" But Ican't sustain that kind of moral smugness in the face of stories like this one - Ican only admire the courage it takes to make such an impossibly hard decision. Iwould probably do the same thing, and to hell with my disability-rights politics. \"Icould never have your strength,\" people say to parents of disabled children - as if these parents have some sort of special quality that makes their situation easier than it would be for other people. Iknow differently. Some parents of disabled children - mine, incidentally, among them - rise to the occasion and do a fantastic job. Others don't. My dissertation added to the research literature demonstrating that congenitally disabled children are at greater risk of parental abuse. So I'm under no illusions about the stress, pain, uncertainty, and financial and physical burdens that come with parenting disabled children. And yet Ialso know that disabled people can make valuable contributions to both family life and society at large. Iknow that life as a disabled person - even a severely disabled person - can be well worth living. Where does that leave me? With Barbara Ehrenreich . Her op-ed in yesterday's New York Times takes on \"the prejudice [...] that a termination for medical reasons is somehow on a higher moral plane than a run-of-the-mill abortion.\" Ehrenreich supports the right to \"run-of-the-mill abortion,\" of course, and so do I. Absolutely. But Ialso refuse to concede that women who abort a disabled fetus have made a choice that's better or more understandable or more deservedly legal than women who have aborted a fetus because they fear they'll never finish college with a baby, or because they've always disliked children. It always comes down to a personal choice, a personal weighing of uncertain costs and benefits. Imay not always be morally comfortable with the resulting decisions - but, then again, no one has asked me to be. Idon't have to approve of every single abortion to remain determinedly pro-choice.

Unconscionable...\" Idon't actually think there's anything ridiculous about having a website set up to link homeless people with employment services and other government assistance programs. More homeless people have access to the Internet than you might think, through public libraries and homeless shelters - but, more importantly, a well-designed employment resource website would be invaluable to case managers, job coaches, and others who provide direct services to homeless people. My clients don't have home Internet access either (or, often, homes), but Ido searches on their behalf all the time. I've been surprised by difficult it is to find up-to-date Internet information about local services. (Last two searches: an HIV support group for a heterosexual man; organized recreational activities for an adult with mild mental retardation. The support group was so impossible to find that Igave up and created one instead.) Acomprehensive web directory would save me a hell of a lot of time and trouble. So: no, it's not a bad idea. It is, however, a terrible website. There are links to Labor Department press releases and relevant employment laws. There are descriptions of targeted programs and service provision grants , neither of which include information (even telephone numbers) that would actually help clients access services. There's a link to a job search website designed for the general population - Icouldn't find any information there about job training, supported employment, job coaching, or other special programs for people who aren't quite workforce-ready. Some obviously relevant information is missing: for example, links to the federally-funded state Departments of Vocational Rehabilitation, which provide employment services to people with disabilities. The one thing on the page that seems genuinely useful is a link to an HHS website that helps case managers apply for federal benefits on behalf of their homeless clients . In other words, it's a resource that (a) already exists, (b) has nothing to do with the Labor Department, (c) is largely antithetical to the stated goal of helping homeless people find employment, and (d) is for service providers rather than clients. If you want to know what the government is doing to help homeless people get jobs, this website is perfect. If you want to actually get a job for a homeless person, it's useless. So what we have here is nothing more than a government-funded advertisement for Bush's \"compassionate conservatism,\" dressed up as a resource that actually helps the poor.

The Times article also cites the Association of American Publisher's report that total sales of \"consumer book products\" increased 6% worldwide in 2003, a gain mostly attributed to increased sales of e-books and audiobooks. Who's buying all the books, if people have stopped reading? In the second place: Igrew up in a small ex-industrial city with three tiny, poorly stocked bookstores.

More Americans have access to larger bookstores carrying more titles than ever before. How does the rise of the big-box-booksellers jibe with the supposed decline in  reading?

One of the most vicious online arguments Iever had was with a man who maintained that \"only one or two percent of Americans read anything at all,\" and Isee that similarly extreme claims have even made it into published books . It's tempting to believe that our culture is going to hell, and that only a fast-diminishing remnant of civilization remains to hold back the outer darkness... Isuppose. So Idon't know what to make of the Census Bureau survey. The word \"literature\" is repeated so frequently in the New York Times piece about the survey that Ibegin to be suspicious about its meaning. It's a word with highbrow associations, and Iwonder how the average person applies it. If the Census Bureau asks a voracious consumer of Harlequin Romances about her tastes in \"literature,\" will she consider that it applies to her daily reading, or will she deny that she reads any literature at all? My suspicions are bolstered by the fact that the survey found reading to be highly correlated with visiting arts museums and attending performing arts events, and by the quotes from expert commenters. The chair of the NEA refers to \" literary readers,\" not readers. History professor Kevin Starr talks about books in the context of \"high culture,\" and notes that \"You can get through American life and be very successful without anybody ever asking you whether Shylock is an anti-Semitic character or whether `Death in Venice' is better than `The Magic Mountain.'\" Even before this \"decline in reading,\" more people were reading Stephen King and Barbara Taylor Bradford than exquisite literary classics, and yet that's not the context in which the NEA and the New York Times are discussing the state of American letters. Of the three books I'm currently reading (Ted Sturgeon's More Than Human, Dorothy Sayers' Busman's Honeymoon, and Anthony Trollope's Framley Parsonage) two are genre fiction (science fiction and mystery), and one is a 19th century novel which, Isuppose, Icould classify as \"literary fiction.\" Isuspect that only the third one counts as \"literature\" to the Times - I'm not sure about the Census Bureau.

She survived but for the rest of her life will need to be hooked up to feeding tubes for 12 hours each night. Edwards filed suit on the Lakeys' behalf against Sta-Rite Industries, the Wisconsin corporation that manufactured the drain. Attorneys describe his handling of the case as a virtuoso example of a trial layer bringing a negligent corporation to heel. Sta-Rite offered the Lakeys $100,000 to settle the case. Edwards passed. Before trial, he discovered that 12 other children had suffered similar injuries from Sta-Rite drains. The company raised its offer to $1.25 million. Two weeks into the trial, they upped the figure to $8.5 million. Edwards declined the offer and asked for their insurance policy limit of $22.5 million.

Here are the main points where they differ: (1) The content-review process established in the old guidelines is now extended to information posted on the web. (2) The new guidelines require \"medically accurate information regarding the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of condoms in preventing the sexually transmitted disease the materials are designed to address.\" (3) The new guidelines clarify that program materials need to be judged acceptable by a community advisory board which reflects the demographics of the group being served, not just the demographics of the general population, and require that the advisory board be selected by the health department. (4) The new guidelines specify that public health officials need to certify that the average person would not find the content of HIV prevention curricula \"obscene\" according to the Miller standard . Items 2 and 4, obviously, are the ones that have Doug Ireland up in arms. Let's look at them one at a time. Condoms: Ireland says, \"they demand that all such materials include information on the 'lack of effectiveness of condom use' in preventing the spread of HIV and other STDs — in other words, the Bush administration wants AIDS fighters to tell people: Condoms don’t work.\" But Ireland's tightly edited quote is a substantial distortion of the actual proposed guidelines, as you can see by comparing it to my item (2) above. Prevention materials are actually required to provide medically accurate information about condoms, whether that information focuses on their effectiveness (for example, in preventing HIV) or their lack of effectiveness (for example, in preventing herpes). Here's what the CDC considers to be medically accurate information about condoms and HIV , taken from their own factsheet:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "HIV, the virus that causes AIDS: Latex condoms, when used consistently and correctly, are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. AIDS is, by far, the most deadly sexually transmitted disease, and considerably more scientific evidence exists regarding condom effectiveness for prevention of HIV infection than for other STDs. The body of research on the effectiveness of latex condoms in preventing sexual transmission of HIV is both comprehensive and conclusive. In fact, the ability of latex condoms to prevent transmission of HIV has been scientifically established in “real-life” studies of sexually active couples as well as in laboratory studies."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "So the CDC is going to require that HIV prevention literature explicitly state that \"condoms are highly effective in preventing the sexual transmission of HIV,\" that being the \"comprehensive and conclusive\" medical opinion. I'm okay with that. Nothing in the proposed guidelines for community organizations requires an \"abstinence only\" approach or devalues condoms as HIV prevention. Nothing. Ireland's extrapolating from the Bush Administration's preferred approach to high school sex-ed programs to interventions for high-risk communities, and that extrapolation is unwarranted. Obscenity: Here's Ireland: \"These new regs require the censoring of any 'content' [...] They require all such 'content' to eliminate anything even vaguely 'sexually suggestive' or 'obscene' — like teaching how to use a condom correctly by putting it on a dildo, or even a cucumber.\" With all due respect, that's simply nonsense. The only place the phrase \"sexually suggestive\" appears in the new guidelines is the requirement that \"educational sessions should not include activities in which attendees participate in sexually suggestive physical contact or actual sexual practices.\" And the guidelines specify that, although prevention materials are not supposed to directly promote either heterosexual or homosexual sex, that requirement \"may not be construed to restrict the ability of an educational program [...] to provide accurate information about various means to reduce an individual's risk of exposure to, or to transmission of, the etiologic agent for acquired immune deficiency syndrome.\" In other words, it's perfectly allowable to teach people how to put on a condom. The Miller standard for obscenity requires that an average member of the community would find the material \"prurient\" and \"patently offensive,\" and that a reasonable person would find that the material has no scientific value (or artistic value, et cetera, but that's not important right now). It is by no means the case that all sexually explicit material is obscene according to the Miller test, yet Ireland writes about the proposed guidelines as if they prohibit any sexual explicitness in HIV prevention literature. Just as the \"how to insert a tampon\" line drawings inside every box of Tampax aren't considered prurient, and illustrated urology textbooks aren't considered patently offensive, \"how to put on a condom\" illustrations will certainly pass the Miller test. Finally, Ireland complains that \"the CDC will now take the decisions on which AIDS-fighting educational materials actually work away from those on the frontlines of the combat against the epidemic, and hand them over to political appointees,\" by which he means public health departments. As someone who does consulting work for a public health department, I'm insulted on behalf of my colleagues. Who the hell does Ireland think is \"on the frontlines\" if not the people who staff STD clinics and counseling and testing services? At any rate, the guidelines specify that only one member of the review panel should be an employee of the health department, and that the rest should be representative members of the community being served. (Which means, for example, that you can't have a review panel made up of old white men deciding what information is appropriate for young black women.) Again, Ireland is extrapolating well beyond what the guidelines actually say. There's plenty of outrage to be found in the Bush Administration's approach to HIV prevention - say, in their relentless pushing of abstinence-only sex ed programs for teenagers and their political scrutiny of NIH grants . It's not surprising that people immediately leap to think the worst of anything associated with the present government. But in this particular case, Ithink that Doug Ireland is frothing up a lot of public anxiety over very minor changes. [Otter's note: Sorry to have disappeared on y'all without warning.

Oil spills into rivers, bays, and the ocean are caused by accidents involving tankers, barges, pipelines, refineries, and storage facilities, usually while the oil is being transported to us, its users (as in the photo at right, which shows a supertanker, the Amoco Cadiz , sinking off the coast of France in 1978). Spills can be caused by: people making mistakes or being careless. equipment breaking down. natural disasters such as hurricanes. deliberate acts by terrorists, countries at war, vandals, or illegal dumpers. Then what happens? Oil floats on salt water (the ocean) and usually floats on fresh water (rivers and lakes). Very heavy oil can sometimes sink in fresh water, but this happens very rarely. Oil usually spreads out rapidly across the water surface to form a thin layer that we call an oil slick. As the spreading process continues, the layer becomes thinner and thinner, finally becoming a very thin layer called a sheen, which often looks like a rainbow. (You may have seen sheens on roads or parking lots after a rain.) Depending on the circumstances, oil spills can be very harmful to marine birds and mammals, and also can harm fish and shellfish. You may have seen dramatic pictures of oiled birds and sea otters that have been affected by oil spills. Oil destroys the insulating ability of fur-bearing mammals, such as sea otters, and the water-repelling abilities of a bird's feathers, thus exposing these creatures to the harsh elements. Many birds and animals also ingest (swallow) oil when they try to clean themselves, which can poison them. Depending on just where and when a spill happens, from just a few up to hundreds or thousands of birds and mammals can be killed or injured. Once oil has spilled, any of various local, state, and federal government agencies as well as volunteer organizations may respond to the incident, depending on who's needed. People may use any of the following kinds of tools to clean up spilled oil: booms, which are floating barriers to oil (for example, a big boom may be placed around a tanker that is leaking oil, to collect the oil). skimmers, which are boats that skim spilled oil from the water surface. sorbents, which are big sponges used to absorb oil. chemical dispersants and biological agents, which break down the oil into its chemical constituents. in-situ burning, which is a method of burning freshly-spilled oil, usually while it's floating on the water. washing oil off beaches with either high-pressure or low-pressure hoses. vacuum trucks, which can vacuum spilled oil off of beaches or the water surface. shovels and road equipment, which are sometimes used to pick up oil or move oiled beach sand and gravel down to where it can be cleaned by being tumbled around in the waves. Which methods and tools people choose depends on the circumstances of each event: the weather, the type and amount of oil spilled, how far away from shore the oil has spilled, whether or not people live in the area, what kinds of bird and animal habitats are in the area, and other factors. Different cleanup methods work on different types of beaches and with different kinds of oil. For example, road equipment works very well on sand beaches, but can't be used in marshes or on beaches with big boulders or cobble (rounded stones that are larger than pebbles, but smaller than boulders). People also may set up stations where they can clean and rehabilitate wildlife. Sometimes, people may decide not to response at all to a spill, because in some cases, responding isn't helpful or even adds to the damage from the spill. Who takes care of the problem? In the United States, depending on where the spill occurs, either the U.S. Coast Guard or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency takes charge of the spill response. They, in turn, often call on other agencies (NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service are often called) for help and information. The goal of new federal regulations is to prevent oil spills from happening. People who cause oil spills now must pay severe penalties, and the regulations also call for safer vessel design in the hopes of avoiding future spills. In the U.S., people who respond to oil spills must practice by conducting training drills, and people who manage vessels and facilities that store or transport oil must develop plans explaining how they would respond to a spill, so that they can respond effectively to a spill if they need to. What about the rest of us? Because oil and oil products in the environment can cause harm, we need to prevent problems when we can. For example, by avoiding dumping oil or oily waste into the sewer or garbage, we avoid polluting the environment we live in. Sometimes, we can find ways to avoid using oil in the first place: for example, we can bicycle, walk, or take the bus rather than taking a car to some places we need to go. When we use less oil, less needs to be transported, and there's a lower risk of future oil spills. We should understand that it is because we rely on oil that we run the risk of oil spills. That means that all of us share both the responsibility for creating the problem of oil spills and the responsibility for finding ways to solve the problem."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "References Some of the information on this page came from the following linked source.

The portal \n            ( http://servir.nsstc.nasa.gov ) is online \n            now, though it is still incomplete. The importance of having daily \n            wildfire data available during the spring fire season convinced them \n            to pre-release the site, Irwin says. It will be finished later this \n            year. Above: Ascene from the flyby. False colors in this satellite image of Lake \n            Nicaragua represent types of land cover: green is forest, while purple, \n            red, and pink represent specific combinations of agriculture, bare \n            soil, and urban areas.

Now instead we hope that the information will flow freely,\" \n            says Rafael Guillen, Irwin's primary technical collaborator in Central \n            America and an expert in Geographic Information Systems mapping software \n            (GIS). Left: Dan Irwin (light blue shirt) in Central America, flanked by NASA Administrator \n            Sean O'Keefe and Ghassem Asrar, NASA's Associate Administrator for \n            Earth Science. Irwin is the NASA manager of SIAM-SERVER. [ Larger \n            image ] Anything \n            that can be plotted on a map can be integrated into the master database: \n            historic geographic records, modern road maps, satellite spectral \n            data from Landsat and MODIS (MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), \n            or wildlife habitat data from traditional fieldwork. Irwin, Guillen \n            and colleagues hope that all this information, freely available and \n            easy to understand, will help Central Americans make better decisions \n            about the region's beleaguered natural resources. In July, construction will begin on a central data storage \n            facility in Panama. In addition to being the information warehouse \n            for the project, the Panama facility will be a kind of \"situation \n            room\" -- a \"mission control\" for monitoring the health and condition \n            of rain forests, croplands, rivers, and coastal waters throughout \n            Central America. USAID is funding the development of this facility, \n            as well as six smaller facilities in each of the other Central American \n            countries: Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, and \n            El Salvador. These smaller national centers will be staffed by experts \n            with direct access to the central database for helping address the \n            environmental issues in their own countries. Central America is a region with a \n            great richness and diversity of tropical wildlife: though it only \n            constitutes roughly 1% of the planet's surface, the region is home \n            to about 7% of all land-dwelling species. The region is also home \n            to a rapidly growing and widely impoverished human population. Serving \n            the needs of the people without bankrupting the natural resources \n            on which they depend is an enormous challenge to political decision \n            makers. Right: Much \n            of Central America's rich biodiversity in is being destroyed by \"slash \n            and burn\" agriculture. This photo was taken in Petén, Guatemala, \n            by Daniel Irwin. It was local decision makers who came \n            up with the idea for this Web-portal project, explains Irwin. The \n            impetus came from an intergovernmental organization called CCAD (a \n            Spanish acronym meaning \"Central American Commission of Environment \n            and Development\"), which combines and coordinates the efforts of the \n            seven Central American countries' ministries of the environment. Regional \n            treaties charge the CCAD with the task of promoting environmental \n            protection and sustainable development throughout the region. This \n            new Web portal is one tool they sought to help them in their work. \"We're not telling the Central Americans what needs \n            to be done,\" says Irwin. \"Rather we're trying to listen and develop \n            products and tools based on their needs. It is a demand-driven process.\" Once development of the system is finished and local \n            experts have been sufficiently trained, control and operation of the \n            system will be turned over to the local environmental authorities, \n            though NASA will remain available to them for technical support. Meanwhile, anyone with an Internet connection can visit. \n            At the portal you can see plumes from fires and watch rain clouds drift by. Eventually, \n            when the site is complete, you can hop aboard a virtual plane and \n            fly up and down the long Central American coast--just like a high-level \n            environmental minister. As Irwin says, in some ways, it's better than \n            the real thing. SEND THIS STORY TO A FRIEND Credits & Contacts Author: Patrick L. Barry Responsible NASA official: John M.

But up close, St. Basil's Cathedral is downright dilapidated, the Mir space station of churches. While cranes and repair crews in every direction signal the Moscow renaissance, Russia's most recognizable landmark stands comparatively ignored on Red Square amid the boom. The most glorious symbol of old Moscow is getting short shrift in the rush to construct malls, office towers, stadiums and especially the huge Christ the Savior Cathedral just upriver. \"Everyone loves us, everyone comes to us, but nobody needs us,\" laments St. Basil's chief curator, Lyubov Uspenskaya, whose pleas for public or private funds to fix the crumbling bricks and decrepit interior have fallen on deaf ears. \"The state promises a lot, but what we actually receive is only a small percentage of that.\" Few would dispute that the cash-strapped Russian government should pay its pensioners, teachers and state workers first. But authorities who manage to find or raise money for other renovation projects clearly view St. Basil's as a low priority, perhaps because no one stands to get credit or profit from a costly restoration of those famous pineapple and onion domes. Asked about the prospects for a fix up, Culture Ministry spokeswoman Vera Lebedeva had a curt, no-nonsense reply: \"Unfortunately, the government has no money (for St. Basil's), and has no plans to fully restore it this year.\" The story of St. Basil's is as familiar to Russians as the multicolored cupolas are to people worldwide through photographs, children's books or as backdrops for TV newscasts from Moscow. Ivan the Terrible had it built just outside the Kremlin walls in 1552 to honor Russia's victory over the Tatars at Kazan. Formally named the Cathedral of the Intercession, it was nicknamed St. Basil's after a holy man who was buried in the previous cathedral that stood on the site. Living up to his own moniker, Ivan -- according to legend -- had the architects blinded so they could never build anything more beautiful. Despite surviving decades of atheist rule and the wrecking balls that bashed in countless churches under Stalin, the cathedral's bells have long been silent and priests no longer preside at what is now a government museum. Streams of tourists come to have photos snapped out front. But most don't go in, dissuaded if not by the entrance fee (up to 26 rubles, or about $4.30), than by the less-than-welcoming appearance. \"It's a beautiful masterpiece,\" said Fazil Yoosuf, a visitor from Sri Lanka, gazing at the cathedral recently. \"But it's in pretty bad condition in some places. It's clearly neglected.\" Under fading domes and scarred, crumbling bricks, the front entranceway, its white and red stripes faded almost beyond recognition, has the look of a bankrupt barbershop. In the labyrinthine interior, where 10 small chapels lie under the cupolas, reconstruction work that officials say has been under way constantly since 1923 is proceeding at a glacial pace. Glittering icons and bright wall paintings have been restored in some chapels. But overall, the famous cathedral has the ambience of an old barn. The budget apparently doesn't cover the heating bill, so museum employees must work bundled up against the winter chill. The domes were last repainted when Moscow was host for the 1980 Summer Olympics. Officials say it's well past time for St. Basil's to have a true face lift: domes and gold-plating work repainted along with some frescoes and ornaments, basement rebuilt, runoff pipes and pavement redone. And that's just the outside. Uspenskaya estimates exterior renovation costs alone at $3 million. But sponsors can't be found. St. Basil's neglect is in striking contrast to the nearby Christ the Savior Cathedral, a pet project of Moscow's powerful mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. Legions of workers have swarmed over that site for two years, and city authorities and the Russian Orthodox Church aggressively solicited donations via billboards, subway ads and TV commercials to help foot the reported $250 million tab. \"If not for the Cathedral of Christ the Savior, we would have been getting money,\" Uspenskaya said. Another problem, she noted with irony, is that St. Basil's is not collapsing, which is the quickest way to get attention and money. \"We hope that sometime we'll get what we need, maybe when the situation in the country becomes better,\" the curator said. \"Perhaps there are more urgent things to do now.\""}]}

The Corvallis herd includes a group of rams that scientists delicately refer to as \"male-oriented.\" These animals consistently ignore females and bestow all their amorous attentions on members of their own sex. Researcher Charles Roselli says a decade of study suggests sexual orientation is largely hard-wired into the sheep's brains before birth. Now, he's trying to figure out how that happens, zeroing in on genes and hormones. In a bold test of his ideas, he hopes to engineer the birth of gay rams by altering conditions in the womb. Sheep aren't people, but the Oregon work adds to a growing body of research that bolsters biological explanations for sexual orientation across species — including humans. Despite those scientific findings, some religious groups say homosexuality is a lifestyle that can be treated, if not prevented. One such group, the conservative Christian organization Focus on the Family, is sponsoring a one-day conference in Bothell Saturday. The social and political implications of the research are impossible to ignore, leading to unease on both sides of the gay-rights debate. If science proves homosexuality is innate, is there any basis to deny gays equal treatment — including the right to marry? But if scientists unravel the roots of sexual orientation, will it some day be possible to \"fix\" people who don't fit the norms or abort fetuses likely to be born gay? Volunteers needed Researchers will recruit gay men with gay brothers in Seattle this summer to participate in a national study on the genetics of sexual orientation. Scientists will analyze blood samples from 1,000 pairs of gay brothers across the country. Representatives will be at the Seattle Pride Festival June 25-26. More information on the five-year study is available at www.gaybros.com Much of the cutting-edge research is being conducted in other countries, because the political pressure cooker in the United States makes it difficult for scientists to get money, said Brian Mustanski, who juggles studies of the genetics of homosexuality with his main work on HIV prevention at the University of Illinois, Chicago. But controversy can't obscure the facts, he said. \"It's pretty definitive that biological factors play a role in determining a person's sexual orientation.\" Austrian scientists reported this month that switching a single gene was enough to make female fruit flies rebuff males and attempt to mate with other females. Swedish researchers recently found the sexual center of gay men's brains lit up when they sniffed a pheromone-like chemical from men's sweat, but didn't respond to a chemical from women. And last fall, Italian scientists offered a possible explanation for the persistence of gay genes — even though evolution tends to weed out traits that discourage reproduction. The team from the University of Padua found that mothers and aunts of gay men had more offspring than female relatives of heterosexuals, suggesting genes that influence homosexuality in men may increase fertility in females. That the evidence comes from such disparate directions leads scientists to suspect several different biological pathways may lead to homosexuality. Both genes and hormones appear to be important. Nor do researchers discount the possibility that social factors may play a role. \"Itend not to be a nature-versus-nurture kind of dichotomist,\" said Roselli, of the Oregon Health & Science University School of Medicine in Portland. \"Ithink there's probably a very complex interaction that's going on between both biology and the environment that is involved in determining these types of behaviors.\" \"Shy breeders\" Gay sheep may show whether neurohormones fix sexual identity Though they don't talk about it much, ranchers have long known that about 8 percent of rams never father offspring because they only have eyes for other males. Australian sheepherders call them \"shy breeders,\" Roselli said. Upbringing doesn't seem to make a difference. Domestication and captivity aren't responsible, because rams with same-sex proclivities occur in the wild. Roselli's rams come from the U.S. Sheep Experiment Station in eastern Idaho, where federal researchers keep a herd of 3,000 to study genetics, breeding and grazing impacts. They've also been quietly looking into sexual orientation, a subject so touchy the lab's U.S. Department of Agriculture boss won't allow his staff to discuss it with the press. Roselli and his colleagues at OSU are using the gay rams to test what is called the neurohormonal theory of sexual development: that hormones from a developing fetus fix its sexual identity by orchestrating brain organization. Too much or too little of these powerful chemicals, or shifts in timing, may lead to homosexuality, the theory predicts. Last year, Roselli found that a brain region linked with sexual behavior was twice as big in heterosexual as homosexual rams. The difference seems to exist even before birth, he said. The gay rams also had lower brain levels of an enzyme that activates testosterone and promotes typical male sexual behavior. A 1991 study reported similar differences in the brains of gay and heterosexual men, but the findings haven't been confirmed. Human brain studies are problematic for another reason: Brain structures can guide behavior, but behavior also can cause brain structures to enlarge or shrink, making it difficult to say which comes first. So in addition to brain studies, Roselli is waiting for a group of lambs born last spring to reach sexual maturity. Their mothers were dosed with drugs to block the action of male hormones in the fetuses. If Roselli's hypothesis is correct, rams born of this experiment will be disproportionately gay. \"Ijust knew\" Studies indicate sexual orientation is set very early in life Hormones have long been suspect in homosexuality. Doctors used to treat gay men with testosterone injections, until it became clear adult homosexuals don't have blood hormone levels that differ significantly from heterosexuals. But rats, hamsters, ferrets and other lab animals flip-flop their sexual behavior when scientists manipulate the hormones they're exposed to before birth. Such experiments would be unethical in people, but some rare medical conditions offer human parallels. Ahigh proportion of girls with a disorder that causes them to secrete male hormones before birth grow up to be lesbian. About 40 case studies have shown boys who are surgically altered and raised as girls because of genital deformities are overwhelmingly attracted to females once they reach puberty — indicating sexual orientation is determined very early in life and is difficult to alter. That view is supported by a series of studies in the 1980s that found nearly 75 percent of young boys who dress up like girls, play with dolls and consistently choose stereotypical female pursuits will grow up to be gay. Asimilar, though less pronounced, pattern is found in girls who prefer trucks over tea sets. Still, most gay people don't have gender-bending childhoods. As in heterosexuals, the majority say they became aware of their orientation at puberty. \"Ijust knew,\" said Seattle attorney Andrew Kamins, who is gay. \"It's as simple as that.\" Those who argue homosexuality is a choice haven't been able to dispute that fundamental point, said Michigan State University neuroscientist Marc Breedlove. \"If you're going to say people choose a sexual orientation when they reach puberty, you're going to have to find some people who remember making that choice, and there aren't any,\" he said. \"The evidence is starting to look pretty good that hormones early in life influence the probability of who you will be attracted to 10 years later, when people start to get their first crushes,\" he said. The hand test Can the length of one's fingers suggest sexual orientation? Breedlove found support for the neurohormonal theory by photocopying hands at gay street fairs. In heterosexual women, the index and ring fingers are usually about the same length. In heterosexual men, the index finger is shorter, on average, than the ring finger. It's one of several differences between the sexes that seem to be set before birth, based on testosterone exposure. Breedlove found lesbians' finger lengths were, on average, more like men's. The same holds true for other traits, like eye-blink patterns and inner-ear function. \"Every time you find a body marker that gives an indication of prenatal testosterone exposure, lesbians on average are more masculine than straight women,\" Breedlove said. \"This can't be a fluke.\" Patterns aren't as clear in gay men, with some hints they may be exposed to either less or more testosterone before birth. All of the neurohormonal studies also leave a major puzzle unanswered: If hormones shape the brain and the brain directs behavior, what is controlling the hormone levels in the first place? Slam-dunk proof? Twin studies provide evidence that homosexuality runs in the family When Vince Healy finally came out as gay, his disapproving Catholic family was familiar with the story. His older brother had been living with a man for several years. It didn't make things any easier, the 45-year-old Ballard man recalled. \"Iwas very unhappy at the prospect of being gay,\" he said. \"Ikept thinking: Imust be a late bloomer.\" As the youngest of three brothers, one of whom is straight, Healy illustrates the two most robust findings in the science of homosexuality: It runs in families, and the number of older brothers a man has can increase his chances of being gay. About 3 percent of American men and 1.5 percent of women describe themselves as gay or bisexual, according to the National Institutes of Health. Those percentages are three to five times higher among people who have a gay brother or sister. Of course, family dynamics might be the reason, not biology. What scientists call slam-dunk proof that genes are part of the equation comes from twin studies. Genetically influenced traits are more likely to be shared among the closest relatives, and that pattern holds for homosexuality. For fraternal male twins, the gay-gay concordance rate is about 22 percent. For identical twins, it's 52 percent. Based on those results, scientists conservatively estimate homosexuality is about 40 percent due to genes, said Alan Sanders, director of behavior genetics at Northwestern Healthcare Research Institute in Illinois. But genes clearly are not the only factor, or identical twins would always share the same sexual orientation. \"That means there's a significant environmental contribution,\" said Sanders, who is leading a five-year, $2.5 million project for the National Institutes of Health to try to identify the genes involved. Earlier research has pointed to several possible gene regions, but those studies were small and not definitive. With DNA from 1,000 pairs of gay brothers, Sanders' project will be much more powerful. It's very unlikely to uncover a single \"gay\" gene, he said. As in most complex traits, multiple genes and environmental factors probably work together. So far, scientists can only speculate how genes linked with sexual orientation might work. Perhaps they dictate the size of brain structures, which in turn regulate hormones before birth. Perhaps genes directly adjust prenatal hormone levels, or merely predispose people to a gay orientation. Environmental factors could be exclusively biological, like chemical exposure or infection. One theory, backed by some evidence in rats, is that the chemical and hormonal milieu of the developing fetus can be disrupted when pregnant mothers are stressed. Social factors may ultimately prove to play a role as well, Sanders said. None of the psychosocial theories for homosexuality have panned out so far, including Freud's distant-father/domineering-mother dynamic. \"There have been psychological and social explanations for homosexuality for 100 years, and they haven't come up with anything concrete,\" said Ray Blanchard, head of Clinical Sexology Services at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Afew studies suggest a higher rate of childhood sexual abuse in gays and lesbians, though there's no evidence such experiences trigger homosexuality, said Mustanski, the University of Illinois geneticist. Fraternal birth order The number of older brothers may affect your chances of being gay Blanchard's work on gay brothers offers an alternative explanation so odd he originally dismissed it as \"obviously bogus.\" But when he looked into scattered reports that many gay men have older brothers, he was astounded. The findings now have been confirmed by more than a dozen studies, including several of his own: Every older brother a man has increases his chances of being gay. Aman with four older brothers is three times more likely to be gay than a man with none. Blanchard estimates one out of every seven gay men owes his orientation to this \"fraternal birth order\" effect. It's possible to argue for social explanations — bullying by big brothers, indulgent mothers. But Blanchard believes it's biology. Gay males with older brothers weigh less at birth than heterosexual males with older brothers, hinting that something different is happening to them in the womb. Apossible explanation lies in the mother's immune system, which can be activated by cells from a male fetus. For first sons, the effect would be slight. But subsequent boys could cause the immune response to ramp up until it somehow affects a baby's sexual orientation. The idea is feasible, Blanchard cautioned, but still unproven. Not all gay men have older brothers. Not all lesbians have short ring fingers. For some people, genes may be the dominant factor in sexual orientation. For others, it could be hormones. Just as sexual orientation spans a spectrum, scientists suspect there may be a range of mechanisms to explain it. Over the next few years, scientists will begin to fit the divergent lines of evidence into a comprehensive picture of the way sexual orientation arises in both gays and heterosexuals, Mustanski predicts. \"We have these converging lines of evidence that are pointing to the importance of biology. Now we have to connect the dots.\" Sandi Doughton: 206-464-2491 or sdoughton@seattletimes.com Copyright © 2005 The Seattle Times Company"}]}

watched some awful good looking girls go topless so some middle aged \n           man could airbrush their chest to decency, at least woodstock decency. walked to the main stage to catch the ending of james brown getin down \n           with his black self as the intermission gave me time to check, or steal \n           someone's schedule to see the next band, jamiroquai, not my fav, but \n           thi shat he had on and his dancin \"cried homosexuality\" as \n           my girlfriend sez, but thats all good, he made me shake my ass and start \n           off my day all soul funked out. live came next with their serious rock \n           all about the water, they impressed me with their state of mind. sheryl \n           crow came next, so we decided to get the fug outta there to eat or wander \n           some more, anything's better than that. came back to see the last of dmx, and readied for a triple line up \n           of the offspring, korn and bush. offspring was fun to listen with, honestly, \n           safe punk for everybody, but they made nsync jokes so they were go enough \n           for me, korn were kinda korny to me, im still with the opinion bloody \n           beavis and butthead had with them being kinda unoriginal and lost in \n           a soup of mirroring bands, but the lead singer guy was wearing a kilt, \n           so big ups to that. kelly was totally in love with bush so we had to \n           weasel ourselves to the tippidy front of the stage, ill have to admit \n           that i thought gavin, the lead singer guy, was cute in a totally non \n           homosexual way, and so 4 people to the front up went kelly to crowd \n           surf to the front to leave me alone with her $300 elph camera singin \n           to bushes cover of \"this one goes out to the one i love\" found \n           moby was playing at the aircraft hanger rave afterwards, so after the \n           show, i found the veggie burger stand, got one with everything, a big \n           cookie, a frozen nonfat yogurt and icky food bar, then realizing i had \n           3 more days to survive the retardedly high prices and only seeing $20 \n           of the $300 i took out in my wallet, oh well, guess ill just make alot \n           more pb and j sandwiches.... but made it to moby and moby was awesome. for a techno \"artist\" \n         he came out with drummer, bass player and guitar and an odd assortment \n         for himself, along wit hthe usual electronic keyboard thingy. moby was blazin on the guitar, bangin on the drums, makin good noise that \n           made me happy happy. go see moby if you have a chance, that little vegan \n           can make some good tunes. his last song(?) was just him and the computer, \n           making a low, hollow beat the progressively got fast and faster while \n           he stood up on the table and looked all krovy krovy scary with white \n           lights mimicking campfire ghost story sessions. after moby, moby fan needed to get home, but home was hard to find \n           after all that music and miles to walk with little knowledge of where \n           mi was supposed to go. i literally was walking for an hour and a half \n           through the maze of tents, people and port o potties tryin to find that \n           damn tent, i gave up and decided to sleep in a corner under a huge american \n           flag a tent circle brought, one of those monsters that you have to steal \n           from a government building, and wait till the mourn. passing the same \n           guy in the chair with the unsightly look on em, the same people playing \n           the drums, the same 40 year old bastards tryin to get all the girls \n           to show em their titties was too much. i turned around and saw in the \n           trees the caution signs, turned slightly left, saw the crappy orange \n           adobe, looked beyond, and their was my hokey tent, i climbed in at 4:00 \n           am and woodstock day one ended. im \n           not sure when i got up, but it was way too early. at what was now the \n           usual pb and j sandwhiches, the bananas were getting a little too ripe \n           there, especially after i stepped on them from the night before. but \n           such is life. saw this massachusettes band named guster, which was coo, \n           got passed out free condoms which was excellent and checked out all \n           the grassroots independent tents trying to make a difference. signed \n           a million petitions on gun violence, abortion, kelly bought this weird \n           thing you fill with water and it keeps you warm for ten dollars, we \n           then found the same thing for 3 for ten dollars, heh heh. got miself \n           to the anti racist action tent and saw all the cds that they were givin \n           for donations and realized i had all of them cept 1, i made a note to \n           buy it and this book on the philosophy of punk, good reading. counting \n           crows was ahh... boring (\"this is a song about when i was in my \n           twenties and i wasnt doing anything\") , limp biscuit was unapologenically \n           dumb, rage against the machine rocked (of course) and metallica got \n           silly after the 4 t h encore. after metallica, i once again \n           went back to the rave this time to see norman \n           cook , who i deemed the dork of woodstock. i got real close and saw \n           how he mixed his rhymes, ciggarette in one hand, beer in the other, \n           dopey buck toothed smile and horrible haircut, makin the jocks and hippies \n           dance dance dance. i honestly don't know how he does what he does, it \n           looked like he had like two turn tables, he'd take a live sample, screw \n           around with it, make a transition from the last beat while looking at \n           the crowd and flailing his arms, and unlesh his new tune, it was interesting, \n           but got kinda boring when you have no room to dance and people wanted \n           to crowd surf (?). oi got outta there in time to see the smoke from a fire near the mountain \n         bike course lurking towards the aircraft hanger rave spot and found my \n         way home first shot. third day last day, totally tired of my wet shoes, the bathrooms or \n           lack of them, the cost of food, the smell of other peoples sweat on \n           me, the amount of change i didnt have, the fact that i had to go home, \n           the fact that i didnt know wat was up with my girlfriend. did \n           the last of the wandering of the stores, kelly finally got a green shirt \n           she dug, i couldnt find anything for my girl jess, for the quarters \n           i found in my wallet, but i kept searching. saw elvis..... costello, sat down twenty people away to listen to jewel yodel, kelly \n           once again fell in love at the lead singer, this time of creed, and \n           i got myself physched to see my favorite band of the show, the red hot \n           chili peppers, i \n           really wanted to be close for the peppers, got about 9 people away from \n           the front, the feeling that there is 250,000 people trying to get to \n           where you are is pretty core. i looked around my backside to see what \n           the hell was sticking out and saw a mother and her two little children \n           right in front of the stage. the mother was obviously in total delusion, \n           thinking she would somehow make it through the set, she was trying to \n           get all these tall strong guys near her for added protection. kelly \n           and i noticed that we were surrounded by lots of teenage girls, which \n           usually means that were in no fly zone for crowd surfers and mosh men. this \n           being not the case as flea comes out stark naked and starts the chillis \n           set. which rocked unequivetly, i sang with them in all there songs, \n           as the crowd in back of me pushed with the force of the trojan armys \n           opponents. i had to hold on to kelly, who held on to anything she could \n           to survive this total crushing force of the fans persecuted with the \n           same conditions as i, but i didnt care, the songs were good, the peppers \n           were inside, anthonys hair was bleach and short, the songs melancholy, \n           funky and honest, the crowd fuckin crazy, the set seemed to short, the \n           fires the fires!? before the planned encore by the red hot chili peppers, it was announced \n           that there was a small fire near one of the towers and if we all cooperated \n           the firetruck could go in and take it out, i looked around my shoulder \n           and saw three nice blazing demons all scatter brick a brack around the \n           whole place. earlier that day the pax tent, which worked for less gun \n           violence in the usa, was giving away free candles for a vigil, i didnt \n           see no vigel, so i think everyone used them for the song \"under \n           the bridge\" and then later these little waxy things made great \n           starters,oop. the peppers i guess wanted to finish and they did, the \n           only thing i could say that sucked was no higher ground, but a new tradition \n           was made; all menstruating women had to throw their tampons on stage, \n           i think i heard of that one before, but people did it, great another \n           thing being thrown at me. walking back after the last set was interesting. kellys sandled feet \n           werent quite operational, so i offered to piggy back her all the way \n           back to camp, missing the rioters, the fires, the drunken masses, just \n           the masses, the people throwing whole tables and metal cans into the \n           fire, the leaking bathrooms and drinking fountains. the fires were awesome, \n           i totally dug the whole anarchy fuck everything mentality thang, i didnt \n           dig it when i thought of fires near my tent, and the rioters near the \n           tent and the grrr.... not a happy night. finally got all set to collapse in my stinky sleeping bag with kelly, \n         got into that nice happy floaty feeling and then i hear. \"oh my god, get out get out!\", i look up to see about five people flying away from my tent. i honestly \n           thought the tent next to me caught on fire, which wasnt much of a leap \n           of faith since they kept me up with their drunken/high/wasted philosophy \n           about life and breakfast cereals, this guys laugh was unbearable, hyena \n           like, uncontrollable crap. but lo, my fear/hopes faded just a bit as i saw it was a bunch of darn \n           hooligans that stole one of the souped up golf carts to take a ride, \n           he rode over one tent, which was vacant i think and got the fug outta \n           there with a winter ass shade on his face just mowing throw everything. yells of, \"i heard this is has been deemed a national disaster, \n         the fuckin national gaurd is coming, their closing us off, were under \n         martial law!!!\" but i was tired, i put on my contacts just so the next time i get awaken \n         by screams of tripping out girls or a tank rolls by, i could at least \n         see myself die. i needed to get to work on monday, it was supposed to \n         be my last day, i couldnt miss that. 3 hours of sleep is all you need. i looked over to the tent next to me that was giving me hell. deserted. \n           no one there. just a box of cereal samples, the collapsed tent, trash, \n           (shit that stuff was everywhere) and a prize for me. three beat up bead \n           necklaces. two purple, one green, showing the hellbent week in their \n           condition, and free for me, perfect. i plan on telling an extrapolated \n           version of that itty bit and give her the beads, maybe for a goodbye \n           gift, maybe just to end a night of talking and holding each other. well \n           see... 3 \n          frapachinos later a large (i mean large) hazelnut coffee and 2 hours \n          into driving back to ct, i was filled with astonishment of the show \n          i went to the people i saw, the good times, the fuckin bathrooms, the \n          messed up showers, the bands the bands. a new friend to miss when i \n          move, couldnt beleive i didnt see anyone i knew. got to work a half \n          hour late, high on adrenaline and caffeine, no one even asked what that \n          green band around my neck was or those 3 sets of beads around my neck. \n          went home.. tried to collapse, went out again skateboarding. which in \n          the state of my knees, legs feet and mindset should have been impossible, \n          but those kickflips kept coming out. i found myself screaming at anyone \n          i saw, being totally rash and filled with the fucked up mentality that \n          the show gave me. it hasnt calmed down, i hope it doesnt. lifes too \n          short to play it safe, im glad i blew off all those important things, \n          spend all my college money, went with someone i barely knew and had \n          alot of fun. summers been so good to me, ive been living this song \n          mark told me about, ive been doing so many crazy things this summer, \n          i thought the worst was getting into a relationship with a girl i just \n          met and have to leave in two weeks, but this show is quite a close second. \n          i know people are goin to blow off the show as what it eally was, corporate \n          sponsored greed, media driven hype, spring break in the summertime, \n          but screw that, it was fun, it was scary, its something im glad i was \n          apart of and something now that i have to get the vdeo for just to see \n          myself again. good things: no fights i dont think i saw one person get there ass kicked. my theory for this \n           is simple. i could have beat the shit outta someone during a show that \n           ticked me off, but about twenty people would do the same thing to me. \n           kinda a nuclear war, no winners scenario, kept the balance because of \n           fear of the outcome. either that or everyone was too tired to fight \n           or didnt want to get all stinky after taking that one shower for the \n           week. canadian \n           pride i didn't check a map or anything, so i'm not sure how far from canada \n           i was, but everyone from canada showed it by wearing the red and white \n           maple leaf flag on em, patches, t-shirts, whatever, it was really cool \n           maybe they didn't want to be thought of as american while goin to woodstock, \n           maybe their government has brainwashed their little minds, maybe i should \n           be so proud of my country (ha!) but thats not gonna happen anytime too \n           soon lots of stuff to fix.. canada actually looks pretty good. vive \n           canada or however you say it in franche. kelly kelly is cool, were both dorky computer people that hooked up online, \n           she made me realize you can start a real world relationship in the www \n           world, heck shes been doin since she had her 8086 and chatting on west \n           harford bulletin boards way before aol. i keep getting drawn in by really \n           laid back people, sorry kids no sex took place, we didnt even wake \n           up in embarrassing positions in our teeny tent, so jess rest assured. watermelon food was inflated to the point of idiocracy. 4 dollars for water?! \n           yeah. but there was a stand sellin watermelon for a dollar and that \n           waterelon was gooood. other good eats was the big meal at the tibetan \n           stand and al the vegetarian delights offered to me, its nice to not \n           have to go to a hot dog start to ask for just the buns. bad things bathrooms 250,000 young adults can not use port of jons correctly, theyre too \n           much of a target to deface, push over and screw up. i would have certainly \n           paid 20 bucks more on my ticket for something, anything better. the \n           small was quite a scream, and having the bathrooms right next to the \n           clean water was a really good idea, really. the \n           water system there was free water available to us. it came out of pipes that were \n           attached to these huge concrete things, but by the second day, all the \n           fixtures were busted and not in any shape to use, so water got scare \n           or just hard to get to. what was really something they must have looked \n           over was the drainage to all the water that freely flowed outta the \n           pipes. ie, there was none. there was a group of bathrooms on the top \n           of a small hill in the concert area. each day i walked near it, the \n           muddiness of the grass that sat beside it got larger and larger till \n           it covered clear across the whole aircraft field, it was impossible \n           not to get your feet wet and muddy and as such my feet stayed nicely \n           wet for four days, dish pan hands are nothing compared to my feet these \n           days. the playlist the list of when the bands were playing was available but it got as specific \n         as what day they were on and of what order. there was even groups not \n         on the bil that werent on the list at all, which made trying to schedule \n         your day impossible. the violent femmes were supposed to play, they werent \n         even there, damn website. i hate when informaton is falsified, oh well. the prices everything was expensive big shock when i got halfway through writing this, i realized i could never write \n          everything that happened to me, theres too many details and odd stuff \n          that happened. i guess this is just goin to be something to remind myself, \n          to look at one day to use to get all the finer points back into mi noggin. \n          maybe you went to this show, and have another twist to it, id love \n          to hear, ill link to yours, or even post it for you lets hear it. sorry i didn't take any pics, something bout bringing my canon ae-1 \n          with all its lenses, flash and motor drive didn't sit well in my mind, \n          luckily, this crazy person snaps \n          some good ones update 8/7/99 : my friend kelly who i went with put up her \n

{"file_number": "166", "plaintext": [{"tag": "div", "text": "Child poverty"}, {"tag": "h1", "text": "Low income families to receive 1bn in tax credits"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Phillip Inman Thursday  March     17, 2005 The Guardian Families on low incomes were given a boost yesterday with a promise by the chancellor of a £1bn giveaway over the next three years."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The move was welcomed by anti-poverty groups, which said the chancellor had reacted to evidence that without a rise in benefits he could miss government targets designed to halve child poverty. Opposition MPs said much of the money would not reach families until next year and the changes were an example of his \"pay later\" budget. The bulk of the £1bn will ar rive in 2006/7 and 2007/8 through the tax credit system for families with incomes of less than £22,000. The government will spend an extra £260m in the first year and an extra £480m in the second year, raising in line with earnings the amount families receive for each child through the child element of the child tax credit. Other tax credit payments will continue to rise in line with inflation, the chancellor said. Alarge increase in childcare payments through the tax credit system announced in the pre-budget report in November will also go some way to helping families on higher incomes with large childcare bills. From April, the cost of childcare eligible for payments rises from £135 to £175 for a family with one child and from £200 to £300 for two or more children. From 2006, the amount of childcare families can claim rises from 70% to 80% of the total bill and the family income ceiling rises from £42,000 to £59,000. Lone parents in the home counties will benefit following the decision to extend a pilot in London, Bradford and Edinburgh that boosts incomes in the first year of work. The chancellor said he wanted to add areas where housing is expensive to the scheme. The extra payment is worth £40 a week up to a maximum of £2,000. There has been a 40% increase in the number of lone parents returning to work since 1997, which Mr Brown would like to see rise further in the second half of the decade. Mr Brown said he was asked by some lobby groups to use the resources available to him to raise personal allowances by more than inflation. \"But having examined representations made to me, Ihave found that using £1bn to raise the personal allowance would give a family in work on median earnings (£23,400 a year) with two children just 80p a week or £40 a year. But using the same resources to raise the child tax credit will give that same family £5 a week, or £260 a year. So the best way to   do most to help low and middle income families is not through a further rise in personal tax allowances but through tax credits that offer the best family tax cut.\" The rise in the child element of child tax credit will total 13% over three years. Including child benefit, he said, families will receive up to £63 a week for the first child and £111 a week for two children. Mr Brown said: \"Because of rising child tax credits a total of 3 million of Britain's 7 million families with children will now receive more in tax credits and child benefit than they pay in income tax - and have their income tax liability effectively wiped out.\" One Parent Families, the   charity that campaigns on behalf of single parents, welcomed the tax credit increases but said: \"Further child tax credit increases will be essential in future years if the government is to achieve its ambition of halving child poverty by 2010.\" The Low Incomes Tax Reform Group said it was disappointed the government had failed to acknowledge the hardship of the 80,000 tax credit claimants who were overpaid, mostly due to computer errors, and have been forced to make repayments. It said the chancellor should address severe admin problems with the tax credit system before making low income families even more reliant on it. 'This rise makes no difference when I'm losing through their incompetence' Londoner Ailsa Forbes says the increase in tax credit payments announced yesterday will make little difference to her weekly budget. Ms Forbes, a lone parent with two small children, is one of the many victims of the tax credit system who must survive on a fraction of her entitlement while her dispute with the Inland Revenue, which calculates annual tax credit allowances, goes through an internal appeals procedure. The Inland Revenue believes Ms Forbes has been overpaid child tax credit and has clawed back more than £700. She says the dispute goes further, since a computer error in September last year fixed her payments at a level below one agreed with the Revenue. \"It has been stuck at the wrong amount and the Revenue blames the computer, which it doesn't seem to be able to change,\" she said. \"I'm going into my third year of child tax credit problems, and frankly this   rise makes no difference when I'm losing so much more through their incompetence,\" she said. Ms Forbes, who works part-time as a product designer for a chain of retail outlets, is one of many single parents to suffer problems with their working tax credit or child tax credit payments. The charity One Parent Families said in a recent report that a quarter of single parents were overpaid tax credits last year and more than nine in 10 had been forced to make re payments from their current benefit allocation or were waiting to hear how much they had to pay back. Working tax credit and child tax credit provide income top-up payments, including childcare subsidies. As at December 2004, 5.9 million families were receiving tax credits. However, it has been dogged by errors. In the first few months computer errors meant millions of payments were delayed. One Parent Families said there was a growing problem from overpayments that in 80% of cases were due to administrative error. Ms Forbes joined about 78,000 claimants who asked for overpayments to be written off as they were due to error. Only 1,600 have been written off so far. She has taken her case to the adjudicator's office, the Inland Revenue's internal watchdog, but has been told to wait at least six months for a verdict. In the meantime, she said, she must live on whatever the Inland Revenue computer decides to pay her."}]}

Specific \n        research topics include how consumers select between competing bundles \n        (i.e., how information processing differs when compared to selecting between \n        individual products), the role of bundling in reducing churn in the marketplace, \n        and the optimal configuration of the bundle (the number of products in \n        the bundle as well as the relationship between the products in the bundle) Relationship \n        Marketing In recent years firms have realized that they can leverage their value \n        chains and achieve payoffs such as lower coordination costs, greater market \n        access, and the delivery of quality service by initiating, developing, \n        and enhancing long-term cooperation relationships with suppliers, distributors, \n        and customers. Asampling of research areas in this field include, relationship \n        initiation strategies through the use of market-place signals and social/structural \n        bonds, relationship termination strategies involving hostages, idiosyncratic \n        (specific) investments, and switching costs, etc. Information \n        Processing and Individual Decision Making The area of information processing borrows heavily from psychology as \n        well as economics. In recent years, research has focused on dynamic aspects \n        of consumer preference (i.e., how choices and preferences change over \n        time), information acquisition and use in Judgments (i.e., how people \n        search for information and use information in their decisions), advertising \n        exposure and attitude change (how attitudes are affected by advertising), \n        and customer satisfaction and loyalty. Competitive Marketing Strategies This is an area of immense importance to marketing managers and research in this field requires an understanding of areas outside of traditional marketing such as economics (e.g., game theory) and finance (Capital Asset Pricing Models). One area of study is the wireless telecommunications industry. In this area, one could potentially research how consumers adopt new tecnologies, how should the different telecommunication services be optimally priced given that there are strong cross elasticity across services, and what is the optimum service portfolio. Judgment \n      and Decision Making The study of judgment and decision making is rooted in Behavioral Decision \n        Theory, or BDT, which studies how consumers form judgments and make choices \n        in the marketplace. It is often described as a descriptive alternative \n        to the more normative economic theories of rational choice. In the marketing \n        context, BDT is applied in areas such as (1) the introduction of new products \n        and services, (2) judgment and decision making among multi-attribute options, \n        (3) the influence of market signals on price and quality perceptions, \n        and (4) the impact of description frames on communication and personal \n        selling.

When she finished a Nuer woman took up another chant,\nall joining in. In time a male Nuer cantor (Peter Garkuoth) took over\nleadership, moving between the Nuer with a fly whisk. Telar Deng: asks for silence, calls Rv. MM to pray. Matthew Mathiang: Let up pray. Prays in Arabic language. People in the\nNuer section are discussing issue of distribution of pens loudly; after prayer a\nspokesman requests silence). TD: Today we will start with the formal introduction of some participants\nand observers. It was not an oversight yesterday, but within the programme, to\nintroduce the Commissioners on both sides as well as special guests, foreign and\nlocal. After the introduction Iwill give two opportunities, one to the\nCommissioner of Leer, and one to the Commissioner Tonj County. What will happen\nin the order of their addresses. As Tonj is hosting the meeting, Tonj will come\nfirst, and that of Leer will follow, as a representative of guests. Istart by\nintroducing to you the Commissioners of Bahr el Ghazel to you. Ibegin with\nAndrew Kuac, that is followed by Paul Mayom Akec of Rumbek County. Followed by\nAcuil Tito of Gogrial County. On this side Icall on Joseph Juac Kuol, Commissioner of Leer County. We also\nhave our observers who have come from Khartoum and Iwould like to introduce\nthem to you. First is Gabriel Yoal. We have Samuel Aru Bol Man, Member of\nParliament. We have Faruk Gatkuath. We have Stephen With Munuar. We have also\nbeen honoured to have among us commanders from UDSF forces. One is John Kulang\nPuot. We have commander Peter Riir . We have Gabriel Both Yol. Iapologise, they\nshould have come in order of seniority. Peter Parjang. We have alternate\nCommander Michael Thot Jang. Iwill reserve the other introductions of\nphotographers, etc., for Bill Lowrey to come read their names to us. Bill Lowrey: Would those who are journalists with us please come to the\nfront here. What Iam going to do, is to introduce three people who have been\nwith us during the chiefs' exchange, until now. Then I'll let others introduce\nthemselves. Over the period of about six weeks, including the chiefs' exchange\nvisit, and the lead-up to this conference we have had reporters from Life\nMagazine and the Washington Post . (Mario Maluk is invited forward).\nFrom Life Magazine is the writer, Janet Rightman. And the photographer\nwho is working with her is Malcolm Lenton, not presently in the building, but\nyou have seen him around. And from the Washington Post we have the photographer,\nMichel duCille. The other journalists we have with us have just arrived and will\nbe leaving on the third. They will not be with us the full time, but it is very\nimportant that we support them as they seek to take our story to the whole\nworld. I'm going to ask that each of the three of them, step forward and\nintroduce themselves and their organisation: My name is Stephen Kroshaw and I'm a writer with the Independent Newspaper\n  in London. My name is Thomas Sorenson. Iwork with the Danish Radio in Copenhagen. My name is Tom Pilston, a photographer with the Independent in London. We are grateful for these journalists who have come. They want to see what we\nare doing here and understand so that they can take your story to people around\nthe world, to grasp the importance of what you are doing. In addition to journalists we have partners from organisations which are\nproviding support for you to make this Conference possible. So I'd like each of\nthe partners to come forward, introduce themselves and give a word of greeting\nfrom their organisations. (Jieng women begin singing, \"give us power to\ntriumph over evil; give us power\") Thank you for that wonderful greeting from the women. My name is Jane\n  Conally, Sudan representative from the Christian Aid. What's important is that\n  we go forward with this. Ibelieve CA is concerned to continue to support this\n  series of meeting as well as the process of peace making. My name is Sarah Stuart. Iwork with Jane at CA, as the head of the Press\n  Office, concerned with telling the concerns of our partners to people\n  overseas. This is my first trip to Sudan so this is a very exciting time for\n  me. I'm also writing some articles for BBC radio. My name is Gunter Augustini. Icome from the Protestant Organisation for\n  Development. I'm happy to be here with you and witness this important\n  conference. Iwas asked to convey greetings from the Conference of German\n  churches. Coming from a country that has brought so much suffering to many\n  people, we are very aware that if you cannot solve your problems amidst peace\n  you cannot solve them amidst war. We support your negotiations toward peace. Iaffirm the saying in Swahili, which says, \"When the cattle join together the\n  lion goes to sleep hungry.\" As well there is a staying in Ethiopia that speaks\n  of climbing a tree to see afar. We would like to climb the tree with you to\n  look into the future in the search for genuine peace in Sudan. We will do all\n  we can to support this peace process. Ican only say peace be with you and\n  peace be with you all. My name is Johann Svenson and Icome from the Life and Peace Institute. Our\n  concern is to strengthen the initiatives of local people in their efforts to\n  bring peace. My name is Justin Makuac Maniel, Peace Co-ordinator from the Diocese of\n  Rumbek, working together with the NSCC. We were privileged to be at the\n  beginning of this peace process, meeting at Loki last June. I'm pleased to\n  announce that our Diocesan School in Kitale (Blessed Baghitta Formation Centre)\n  has offered to receive Nuer students to study with them. This is an important\n  advance. My name is Benaiah Odemba. I'm here to represent Catholic Relief Services.\n  We consider the NSCC as one of our strongest partners in Sudan. We are deeply\n  involved in this peace initiative and actually believe in building the local\n  capacity for bringing about peace. As was said yesterday, peace can only come\n  from the people themselves. We believe in peace by and for the people. We look\n  forward to working with you in this important service. My name is Louie Riemen from Church of the Brethren and we have been\n  partners with NCC since it first began. We are now pastors in the US, and our\n  church sends very warm greetings. They ask us to remind you that they pray for\n  you and they pray for peace. (Phil Riemen) It is a special joy to be back for nine weeks to help with\n  this ongoing peace process. My name is Marc Nikkel. Ibring greetings from the CMS as well as the\n  Episcopal Church in the USA, both of which are supporters of this gathering. Igreet you on behalf of thousands of Christians in America and Britain who are\n  praying for you each day we meet. I'm Jamera Rhone. Irepresent Human Rights Watch which is an independent\n  human rights organisation. We report on the abuses of all parties of all\n  conflicts in the world, with the hope that they will be shamed into changing\n  their policies and actions for the good of the people. Iam very glad to be\n  here with you during this very important gathering. My name is Malcolm Linton. I'm a photographer working for Life Magazine\n  working with Janet. We're doing a story about the Conference and we hope it\n  goes very well. BL: Ialso bring you greetings from many organisations in the US who have\ncontributed funds toward this meeting. As well, there are hundreds and thousands\nof people who are in prayer with us each day of our meetings. TD: Okay, we will not proceed with our programme, but Iwould like to\nmake two remarks. First, Rumbek Diocese, and Torit Diocese and others that we have are not\npartners of this Conference. They are actually members of the NSCC. Secondly, we would like to recognise other organisations, such as CEAS and\nWorld Vision who have provided considerable support in preparation for this\nconference. As well, there are a host of other organisations who stand with us\nand support us. Now Icall upon Commissioner of Tonj Country, Andrew Kuac Mayol, to speak to\nus. (Exchange of song begins, Jieng, Nuer, reciprocally) Andrew Kuac Mayol: Brothers and sisters in the Conference Igreet you in\nthe name of the Chairman of the Movement, Dr. John Garang de Mabior. Ialso\ngreet you in the name of the people of Tonj County. It was really a concern of\nour people yesterday that our people did not see me welcoming our guests to this\nmeeting house. People were saying that, as a commissioner of this place, Iwould\nsay a word of welcome to the delegates in general. Let me proceed, because it\nwould have been good for me to welcome yesterday so that the Commander and the\nGovernor were also to hear what the Commissioner of TC was saying. But since\nthat could not happen, let me proceed with a brief speech, even though that is\nnot equal to the speech Ihad prepared yesterday. When we come to the purpose for which we have gathered, we were informed last\nSeptember that there would be a Nuer Dinka meeting in Tonj County. Preparations\nwere made then, but somewhere in the middle we began to doubt that the meeting\nmight not be a success. Why were we doubting? We were doubting because, in the\ncourse of preparations, there were things that were supposed to be done. But we\nfound that little or nothing had been done as far as some services had\nproceeded. Communication was not prompt from Nairobi to our end. We were\nreceiving communication at some points, but at others we were lost in the line.\nThere were times when we had difficulty knowing who was to do what, who was to\nprepare what. But in time we found that Mr. Mario Muor Muor and Tular Deng had\nbeen given certain responsibilities. Icame to this place to speak with the\nchiefs asking that they get on with the work of construction as quickly as\npossible. Building got underway, as did the digging of a well. However, it is\nunfortunate that we have only one well, which results in the congestion which we\nhave experienced. So later on when we saw Mr. Mario running back and forth, we\nwere struck by words like those of Shakespeare, which said: ?? We knew that we\nwould have to redouble our efforts. Buildings would have to be built quickly.\nLike these buildings were build quickly in a way that is inadequate to the\nmodern way of preparation. This is why we have many of us sitting on the ground.\nSo much for that, let us proceed. Here, let us come to the very matter for which we have gathered. It is good\nto say that we are here to record a very important event in Tonj county in\nparticular. This is a rare opportunity, hardly to be equalled in our history.\nThe Nuer and the Dinka are one people given their social and cultural\nbackgrounds. But in the course of time we have been divided by the enemies of\nthe people to fight ourselves. However, it is okay because all of us are aware\nthat sons quarrel with their father, and daughters with their mothers, but there\ncomes a time when a family sits together to resolve their differences.\nYesterday, who could not see the white bull outside here? The bull that was very\nfierce, that was almost on the neck of everyone who passed? That bull was not\nbrought by accident, but it was brought by design, and that was a design for\npeace. So, with the words of the spearmasters over this bull yesterday, Ithought that the entire effort was finished, and that we had come here simply\nfor formalities. If we did understand the words of the spearmasters talking\noutside over the bull, and even inside here, Idon't think we have much more to\nsay. It has been done. We have only to reflect on the wise resolutions which we\ncan make to bring the words spoken to their fulfilment. Something small that Iwould have said before, Iwill have to say now. Our\nmeeting for peace has brought people from far away. Dr. Peter Nyot is here from\nGermany, and Michael Wal has come from the US, both have come from afar to join\nwith us. This shows us that this is a serious matter since those from far away\nare joining with us here. As well, our foreign press people show that this is a\nworld-wide concern, since organisations from far away have sent their\nrepresentatives. We have even asked ourselves concerning some people, how they\nhave come, if they were invited by the churches or other people. I'm seeing\nbrother Samuel Aru with a very serious delegation from Khartoum, so Ihave asked\nmyself if Omer Bashir is interested in peace. Anyway, translation of this kind,\nmakes a very short speech, to be far too long. Therefore I'll conclude by speaking to the Dinka Chiefs and the Nuer Chiefs.\nMine is a word of caution to you. You spoke well yesterday as spearmasters, as\nelders, and as leaders. Iwould want that to be repeated today. because we have\ncome here to look for peace and reconciliation and unity. Iam not saying that\nyou should not air out your views, but that you should air out your views in a\nconstructive manner. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here. Don't quarrel here.\nYou are to say your viewpoints here cool headed, rationally, and without raising\nyour emotions. All of us, the intellectual guest, are here to help you come to\nhelpful resolutions. You must say the right thing. It may happen that at some\npoint one of you will call for us to close the discussion because we are all\nsaying the same things. Avoid unhelpful arguments, matters that are not\nnecessary in our discussion of peace and reconciliation. Let us avoid matters\nthat look like we are in the courtroom. This is not a court we are creating\nhere. So, before Igo, Iwould like my counterpart, the Commissioner, to come here,\nso that we extend to each other, the greetings of peace. (The Nuer\nCommissioner comes forward, and the two grasp hands, holding their hands aloft\nbefore the community; the people on both sides respond with songs, chants,\naffirming the meeting. Nuer move into a full chant with extended responses). TD: Idon't have much to do, since the Commissioner has already invited the\nCommissioner from Leer. Commissioner of Ler, Joseph Juac Kon:  I'm greeting you in the name of\nGod, in the name of our land, you, the Dinka and Nuer, our guests, and you who\nhave organised this conference. As well, I'm speaking of the peace that was\nsigned on the 21st April, 1997. So I'm greeting in the name of the Peace\nAgreement. Iam the person responsible in the government of Dr. Riak Machar for\nthe Co-ordinating Council. Ialso greet you in the name of this Council. When\nthe government was formed, the former commanders who were in the bush, these\nwere chosen to become the governors. . . . Maker Macek. When Iwas appointed and\ncame to Leer as its Commissioner, Iwas told that there was a grassroots peace\ninitiative. Some of my leaders were taken to Loki for the meetings, and soon a\nnumber of abductees taken from our people were returned to us. Iwas there to\nreceive them as they came home. Icame here with fourteen chiefs from my area and others from other areas,\nsuch regions as Akoba and Nasir on the East Bank. And those far north of Bantiu.\nWe all came together with firm hope and enthusiasm for this peace. We came\nhoping that the Nuer and Dinka will be able to live in peace. We, the Nuer from\nthe Western Upper Nile, all came, except those from Menkin in the Bul area. You\nall know the conflict that continues there, and we ask you to hope with us that\nthe fighting in that region will be brought to an end. Icame here with the\nfirst Brigade Commander, and Acting Zonal Commander, Peter Pajiek, we came\ntogether so that he can talk to his forces, to preserve the resolutions of this\nimportant, historical occasion. We also came with Commander Gabriel Both Yol who\nis in charge of security in the Leer State. As well, because of the support of\nthis peace by Dr. Riak Macar, the General Secretary of the USDF has also come so\nthat he can report back the resolutions that are made here. Gabriel Yuol Dok, as\nSecretary of the Party is with us. The Khartoum Agreement was signed by Samuel\nAru. He did not come here because he is a son of this area but because he is\nwith Riak in the Government, and he has come to witness this important event.\nThe Southern Defence Forces/Movement are represented by Commander Peter Riir Puk, (PRP comes forward and says that all the senior officers of the SPLA know\nme). The speech of the Governor of Bahr el Ghazel, Nhial Deng Nhial, made me\nvery happy, when he said that the matter is not simply for the organisations to\ncome together, but that we share common objectives. Having heard this we all\nslept very soundly, with the hope of these words. Also, as we are witnessing\npeople as they speak, we are further convinced by the actions of Commander Selva.\nWe are glad to see his firm, practical commitment to facilitating this effort\ntoward peace between our peoples. Iwant to correct the statement made by our elder William, yesterday, when he\nsaid that he was a thief. He did not mean that he himself was a thief. We are\nall children of one father. Those who are raiding cattle are William's children,\nand thus he identifies with them. It seems this was misunderstood. Historically,\nwe Nuer, have so many Dinka with us, and so many of our chiefs were originally\nDinka. When Dinka came to settle in our land, we usually gave him the first\nplace, choosing him as leader. We have no difficulty with a man from afar being\na leader among our people. Iconclude my speech offering that history. Igreet you all in the name of\nJesus Christ our Lord. TD: (What commander Selva said as he opened his remarks yesterday was\nsimply a joke. There was no reference to the elder, William himself. It was\nsimply a humorous comment). Our next speakers will be women, one from Bahr el\nGhazel, and one from Upper Nile. The first is Awut from Bahr el Ghazel, to be\nfollowed by Deborah Nyandien from Upper Nile Awut Deng Acuil: Iam called Awut, a woman of Rek and Agar Dinka. Ihaven't nothing great to say today. In terms of age Iam younger than most of\nyou. Iam only a child. The joy of the In such occasions, whether you are young\nor old, it will not prohibit from the young from speaking. Igreet you all, and\nconsider you all as my children. Women gives birth to a man, who becomes a white\nhaired elder. What Iwant to say is that this gives us great joy that Nuer and\nDinka should come together for all of us have suffered, with many women and\nchildren killed during the fighting between our peoples. Iexpress my\nappreciation to NSCC and all affiliated churches that have brought us together.\nIexpress my thanks to both for SPLA as well as the USDF, for if they had not\nagreed, it would not have been possible for us to meet in this way. Ithank all\nthe chiefs and elders, Nuer and Dinka, who have come here knowing that fighting\nwill get us nowhere, and that we must discuss our differences in this important\ngathering. Ithank the foreigners who have come all the way to Wunlit to sit\ndown with us and observe our negotiations. Iwill not speak long. This is not a court, but a process of reconciliation. The women of Bahr el\nGhazel, concerning their children, those they have given birth to, that they don't want their offspring to be killed any more. Yesterday someone said that\nthe women had stopped bearing children. Not only have they ceased to bear, but\nthey wish that those who are in the army, as combatants could return to their\nwombs again. It is both the women of Nuer and Dinka who have borne children, but\nit is not our desire that our young should die without good reason. What Ibeseech you, the chiefs and elders of Nuer and Dinka, that you will\nsettle these differences, that you come to final resolutions to stop the killing\nof our children. I'll do as the Commissioner of Tonj has just done, Icall on\nDebora to come forward that we as women can greet one another (Debora comes\nforward; Awut begins to sing, \"Dooray, dooray, we have come for peace\"). We hope\nyou have heard our voices. I've come to express my joy in this peace effort. Ihave nothing more to say, and give place to Deborah. Deborah Nyandien: Iwill speak, and Iwill use my Nuer language. The\nreason Ispeak in Nuer I'll tell you now. Iam called Deborah Yaar Jieng. Those\nfrom Yirol and Rumbek will know me. My father and mother were Nuer who left\ntheir home for Dinkaland long ago. When they travelled, they went to settle near\nYirol where my uncle, Nyibol, my uncles are here now. When Imarried, by\naccident, Mathiang Gok knew that their daughter was taken back to Nuerland. Iwill stop here concerning my own history, going to the centre of what Ihave to\nsay. Igreet you in the name of all women who have been created by God to bear\nchildren. People of God, you the NSCC, and all related churches, Igreet you\nwith appreciation for your efforts to bring our peoples, Nuer and Dinka, will\nhave peace. Ialso greet all our guests who are here. Specifically, Igreet Bill\nLowrey, with thanks a hundred times over for his efforts throughout this long\nprocess until we meet at this stage. The two communities who first went to\nBilpham to train to fight this war against the Arabs. Igreet our elder Samuel\nAru Bol who has come to witness this meeting. Iam a women's leader among women.\nIhave come with 11 women from Bentiu to attend this meeting. Six women have\ncome from Khartoum, all Dinka women have come to observe. The Nuer women have sent a message to the Dinka women, which Inow declare.\nThis is similar to that given by Awut our sister. Since the 1960s, beginning of\nthe war of Anyanya I, we want to know from the men, why our children should be\ndying like this all these years! My word is like that of Awut. You the Nuer and\nDinka women, and even those from outside, Iwant to ask the men this question.\nWhat Iask is how it is that, since the creation of the earth, whether in all of\nhistory any man has died with a child in his womb? I'm not asking for an answer,\nbut Iwant you to think about it. Be quiet, and consider this question. I'll add\nthis as well: Has any man ever felt the great pains of labour in giving birth?\nWomen, we alone know the pain of giving birth, and our words and our thoughts\nmust be taken seriously. Don't discard the importance of our words! You Dinka\nand Nuer don't often consider the thoughts of women, but today hear us clearly,\nconcerning all the children have died among us. I'm saying this because , while\nyour are in discussion, , know that we will watch you carefully. If you don't\nultimately take our words seriously, then you must understand we will make a\nrevolution, and we will stop giving birth. Iknow you men are laughing because\nyou say you are married through payment of bride price over which women have no\ncontrol, and also that women have no power to make a revolution against you.\nHowever, we are speaking today, not as the women of the past. Iexhort you also,\nnot to discuss, without taking a break from your deliberations. Take an\noccasional break. Ithank you and conclude here. TD: Dr. Haruun Ruun invites the two Commissioners who have spoken as well\nas the two women who have just spoken to come forward. HR: Iam emotionally moved and cannot express my feelings strongly\nenough. Iwould like to summarise it in this way. Iwant the two Commissioners\nand the two ladies, and myself to join our hands, and declare that we will\ncommit ourselves to do all we are able to bring this peace to fulfilment. We\nwill urge our friends here in Sudan, in Africa, and outside Africa to stand by\nus, and to pray for us. Let me repeat the joke that was said earlier. The ladies\nsaid, we will go on strike. It is powerful, that women should refuse their\nhusbands. We are no longer traditional ladies, we are women of the modern world\nand we know what we are able to do. Let us join hands. Now, you ladies, also,\nknow that some of our boys are dying because you are saying, if you ;have no\nmoney and you have no cattle how are you going to marry me? You cannot win a\nchild unless you have a cow with milk. We are all responsible for what happens\namong us. And we must all together accept the responsibility and work toward a\nsolution. (The 2 women and 3 men join hands together in the centre of the\nhouse of meeting and photographs are taken. They lift their hands up together.\nThe Dinka begin to sing, \"We have come for peace . . .\"). Thank you, all of\nyou. Thank you. TD: Let me read for you the programme. following. It is now 12:50. We\nwill return at 2:50 p.m. The order of business will be as follows. What we will\ndo is this. Any aspect of clarification can be made later. The Dinka will begin\nto speak of their experiences during recent years. The leaders of the Dinka will\nspeak first. The Commissioners of Yirol, Tonj, Rumbek are full participants and\ncan share in the content of the conference. Ideclare that we are free to go for\nlunch. Afternoon Session, 3:15 p.m. TD: We have guests who have come who need chairs. I'm asking you Dinka to\nassist with this. Let us start our evening session. Before we move to the Dinka\nside we would like to make a few introductions. When we were in Nairobi we\nformed a team of Rapportuers, individuals who we believe are devoted to the\npeace process. These people are here with us, though two were unable to join us\nfrom Europe. Before us are: Mulana Dhol Acuil. Mulana John Luk. Timothy Tut Chol, was responsible for contacts between NSCC and the SPLA On the side of USDF we have Bill Mar. We have Faruk Gatkuoth, also of USDF. The two who could not attend from Europe are Ruth Danier, and Majok Guando.\n  Inow invite Rev. Bill Lowrey to tell us something of the preparations. BL: Ever since the Loki Accord was signed on 10th June, 1998 we have had\na team working on this Conference to take place in BeG. When we met in Loki the\nchiefs and churchleaders from the West side of the Nile put together their plans\nfor this conference. One of the things they said was that this would be a\nconference of the people, in which local people would take the lead, and it\nwould not include poliltical leaders. They may be present as observers but not\nas participants. They said that all of the people must be mobilised to\nparticipate in this conference, that NSCC should prepare the Conference, and\nthat observers from around the world must be invited to attend. So for these\nmany months there have been numerous people involved. Gradually the group has\nchanged, with women and chiefs always part of the process, and always there has\nbeen the desire to have Dinka and Nuer from outside as full partners in the\nprocess. So Inow want to introduce you to some of those people who are here\nnow. Some are not present, but have worked hard over the months, but I'll\nintroduce you to those who are now with us. The Chairman of our Team is Dr.\nHaruun Ruun. We have two people who have worked to mobilise the people in BeG and in\nWestern upper Nile. One is Rev. Matthew Mathiang Deng. The second is Judge Telar\nDeng. We have had two women who have been involved with us, Awut Deng whom you\nheard speak this morning. The second is Nyawaraga Joshua who is not able to be\nwith us today. We have asked intellectuals from the Diaspora to come and be part\nof this team. One of those is Dr. Peter Nyot Kok from Germany, and the other is\nDr. Michael Lual Duany from the USA. Always, as it was possible, we have asked\nthat Chiefs meet with us so that they could observe if we were keeping on the\npath that was set for us at Loki. And I, Dr. Bill Lowrey, have served as a\nfacilitator for this Team. The two chiefs who have been most involved with us\nthroughout this process are, first, Chief Dut Malual, who Iunderstand is sick\nin Nairobi, and we are missing him. The second of them is Chief Isaac Magok from\nLeer (stands, waving his fly whisk). Now Iwould like to tell you a short story from the Bible, that sets the\nstage for the Dinka to tell their story before the Nuer, and for the Nuer to\ntell their story before the Dinka. This is a story that Itold in Loki for the\nchiefs and leaders in Loki, and that was the beginning of three days in which\nthey told their stories, each group to the other. As you know, today is Sunday,\nwhich is the first day of the week. It was on a Sunday, after Jesus had died on\nthe cross and been raised from the dead, that this story took place. Most of the\ndisciples were together in a special room, but one was missing. His name was\nThomas. And suddenly Jesus appeared in the room, and his message was, \"Peace be\nwith you.\" The disciples were excited to see him, but when they told Thomas, he\nwould not believe it. He said, unless Isee him, and put my fingers in his side\nwhere the spear went in, Iwill not believe it. One week later, again on a\nSunday, Jesus appeared in the room and Thomas was present. Jesus said to Thomas,\n\"Reach out your fingers and feel the wound where the spear went in.\" This is a conference about reconciliation. Thomas could not be reconciled\nuntil he could see the wounds that he had helped to cause, and touch the places\nwhere Jesus had been wounded. For seven and a half years now, Nuer have caused\nwounds and injuries to the Dinka, and for seven and a half years now, Dinka have\ncaused wounds and injuries to the Nuer. If you want to be reconciled you must\ntell each other the wounds you have suffered, you must look at each other, and\nreach out and touch one another in the places where you have been wounded. It\nwill be important that you speak the truth, that you not hide anything from\nanother, so that the reconciliation goes deep, and it is a genuine healing of\nthe wounds you have inflicted. When you speak the truth, when you say the hard\nthings to each other, when you identify the issues that must be solved, then you\ncan reconcile relationships, and you can walk out of here, saying now we are\nbrothers and sisters once again. In just a few minutes, you as the Dinka, will\nbegin to tell the Nuer your stories. Do not hold back. Tell the true stories, no\nmatter how painful it may be. In just a few minutes, when the Dinka tell their\nstories, you Nuer, you must listen carefully. Do not debate with them, do not\nargue with them. Relationships begin with listening. And when they have finished\nyou will tell your stories to them. The time of beautiful speeches is over. It\nis now time for the hard work of peace. You must make a peace that will last.\nWhen Isit down, this will be your work. You, Nuer and Dinka, must make this\npeace and determine how deep the peace will go. May God give you the strength\nyou need. TD: Okay, Iintroduce to you Dr. Peter Nyot Kok, who will take the chair\nas the Dinka present their narratives. The first speaker will be Chief Dut Yol. Dr. Peter Nyot Kok: Igreet you warmly, you Nuer and Dinka, you chiefs\nand elders, women and youth, you soldiers, may you all be blessed here. The talk\ntoday and onwards is for you the chiefs to talk, not me. However, after you have\nconcluded your statements, Iwill speak. Peace and reconciliation began\nyesterday when a white bull was sacrificed, and libations were poured. We had\nalready raised the house of peace, but what remains is the plastering of the\nwalls and floor and roofing of the building of peace. However, this is not easy\nwork that is before us. If we plaster the house wrongly it is likely that\ninsects will still bight us. If we don't put up good poles it is likely that the\nhouse will leak. Iwill start with what Bill Lowrey has said, that we must draw\nfrom the experience of our ancestors. We do each stage of the work so that it is\nsuccessful, and it is a solid house. During our meeting we will begin with the\nchiefs who attended the meeting in Loki, and we will move ahead so that a\nrepresentative from each county has opportunity to speak. Iam appealing to the\ntranslators who are speaking in Dinka, Nuer or English that you work to\ntranslate accurately, because this is a difficult aspect of our work. Now Iwill\ncall Chief Kulong Marial and, secondly, Chief Juol Macok. Together they will\nhave one hour to speak. Chief Kulong Marial: Iwill not speak at length. Ihave been a chief for\na long time, in the area of Mapeer in Rumbek. By ethnic group Iam Agar from BeG\nRegion. Some months ago Iattended the meeting in Loki for the purpose of\nreconciliation between Dinka and Nuer. When Ireturned from Loki Idisseminated\nthe content of the Accord among Dinka and Nuer. Recently, Ialso participated in\nthe exchange visits of the Chiefs, stopping at Leer, and here. Yesterday we\nbegan our reconciliation by offering a white bull, and we said all that needed\nto be said, and the bull is now in its eternal existence above. It has always\nbeen our traditional practice that, when we have conflicts, as we often do, we\nmake sacrifice and we are able to reconcile and return to our normal life.\nUsually we conclude by confirming an accord between ourselves and Nuer with an\naccord that states we will no longer raid one another so there is no more loss\nof property or life. At the end of every conference we come out with\ndeclarations which are sent to Leer, Mapeer, Tonj, and elsewhere, confirming\nthat we should no longer fight each other. And the present reconciliation, being\nassisted by the churches, means that we address the issues that divide us and\nbring conflict and we put an end to them. Sometimes back we had a conference in\nGainlel, and we sacrificed bulls and that concluded our conflicts between Dinka\nand Nuer. As well, we had a conference at Wuniloor, and that meeting ended our\nproblems until the conflicts of Anyanya Ibrought out new conflicts between\nDinka and Nuer. The border conflicts intensified again with the tension between\nSPLA and Nuer, giving thieves concerned with their own well-being opportunity to\nexploit our differences. As well, our differences have been exploited by our\nenemies. D&Nare brothers, who share common borders. With our sacrifice\nyesterday our hostility was brought to an end. There are people who are against\nthis peace agreement, who have benefited from our hostility. There will be some\nwho will come trying to persuade our peoples on each side to believe that the\nother will not be faithful to our agreement, but we must not listen to these\ndeceptive words. We have always been fighting each other, D&N, but has never\nbefore happened that we deserted lands such as Mapeer. Today it is other people\nwho have come in to exacerbate these conflicts. An example is that our ancestral\nhome of Rumbek was in the hand in the enemy. Now that we have captured it from\nthe enemy we have made alterations and we are able to occupy our own lands\ncomfortably. As Isaid, in respect to Rumbek, Ican now return to my ancestral\nhome of Mapeer and we can settle there once again. Normally, in the relationship\nbetween us and Nuer, what keeps conflicts from being concluded, is when various\npretexts are brought up, saying we must locate the thief, and find the details\nof the case. All of these are delaying tactics, which should not deter us from\npeaceful coexistence. Yesterday we sealed our covenant. It is not in Dinka\ntradition that we should begin accusing one another, or quarrelling with one\nanother, after sacrifice is offered. We should not be doing this here. Our\ngathering here is heard all over the world, in Khartoum and Juba, and many other\nplaces. Thus, in my view, there is no use in talking about past grievances. What\nwe need to focus on is concrete actions to be taken to bring peaceful\nco-existence between our peoples. From this day forward we must stop the killing\nof women and children, and destruction of our properties. We reconcile ourselves\nfrom Yirol, Rumbek and Bentiu. Iwill not proceed further with my address. This\nis the message I'm telling the people of Gogrial and Tuic, that our\nreconciliation was concluded yesterday with the offering of our white bull. This\nis my word. PNK: We have heard Chief Kulong Marial. Our second speaker is Chief Jol\nMacok. Chief Jul Macok Lieny: Iam Agar from Rumbek. Iam grateful to all who\nhave organised this conference. I'm grateful to Bill Lowrey and greet him. Iwarmly greet my brothers from Bentiu, as well as those from BeG. Also, Igreet\nthose from Nairobi. We are here for peace and reconciliation, which we have\naccepted. This conference we declare that we have fully accepted this\nreconciliation. If we were in a court Iwould have asked questions from the\npeople of Bentiu. When people first began going to Bongo, the training camp, it\nwas because of the problem of the South that took them. When those who went to\nBongo split apart, it was unfortunate that we accepted that separation. Inever\nthought there was a government in Leer, until Isaw the Commissioner of Leer. Ihave no bad commissioner from Leer. When we said earlier that we should save\nlives, Ialso accept fully what you said, because Ihave a border with Chief\nMalual Wun. In my community Ihave a few people from Bentiu, like those staying\nhere at Wunlit. Our relationship with the people of Adoor, that is those of\nYirol and Rumbek, is that we are children of one family. We had no part in the\ndivision that had happened. When Isaid Iwanted to ask question of the people\nof Bentiu, Iactually wanted to ask questions of those of Adoor. As a good\ngesture, and to declare that we accept peace, Iwant to say that those who\nraided cattle on the 18th have now been apprehended, and the cattle are to be\nreturned. The civil administration in Rumbek ordered all chiefs to apprehend the\nraiders and return the cattle. This has now been done. (TD: Ibelieve Chief\nChul was speaking of two raids. One was on the 19th of February, and the other\non the 8th. Ibelieve that the those who were responsible for the first have\nbeen apprehended.) Before all who are in attendance here Iwant to affirm\nthat we have agreed to accept the peace between us. At present we have people\nwho have gone from Yirol to Adoor and they have been welcomed by the residents.\nIwill conclude here by saying that we have reconciled with the people of Malual\nWun as of today. PNK: We have one half of an hour remaining from the time given to Rumbek,\nand we invite any other speakers from Rumbek, if they have anything to\ncontribute. From Rumbek we have previously four people. We have Marial Malwal\nArop and Col Madul Rilpiou. Inow give opportunity to Chief Marial Malual Arop,\nto speak toward a peace that cannot be broken, cannot be demeaned by crooks. Chief Marial Malual Arop: What Ihave to say is brief. Our father, Malual\nWun, Igreet them with those who came with him. Ialso greet all the chiefs from\nBeG. Iwant to greet our father Malual Wun is because he was active working\ntogether with my father. When Chief Kulong returned from Loki Iasked if Chief\nMalual was still alive. Malual is now the only one remaining chief with sons of\nthe chiefs who once were his counterparts. We are all children, of this one\nfather who remains, Malual Wun. If there is a complicated problem, and your\nfather is still alive, he would be the one who restrains the children from self\ndestruction. The wisdom of CMW and our wisdom is not the same. He began working\nsince the time of the British with our fathers. Most of us began working during\nthe time of independence with the Arabs. We have always thought that CMW of the\nsaying in Dinka. Alion said to a father to give him his children so he could\neat them. Today all our fathers are gone except CMW. The lion ate all the\nelderly people, but one old person was hidden by his children. The lion that ate\nthe elderly people happened to swallow a snake with water. The snake would come\nfrom his stomach, peaking out from his mouth. On person suggested that he bring\nand old man to take the snake from the stomach of the lion, wouldn't the lion\neat the old man? The lion accepted the old man to be brought. He came and asked\nthe lion to lay down, and tied a rat to the leg of the lion. Then the snake\ncrawled out to eat the snake. To you, our father Malual, you are the only father of all our peoples among\nD&N. Now we want to draw out the snake now. If you have accepted that the\nsnake in your stomach should be brought out by the rat we have accepted to bring\nout the snake, and that is why we have killed the white bull yesterday. Let your\nlion not come again to attack the children and the women. How could we refuse to\naccept peace? The toc which we have been sharing. Is your area Ganlil now\nempty of people? We have accepted reconciliation. When we bypass what our\nbrother said before, and we sit to discuss the past grievances, we are quenching\nthe fire with water and not quenching the fire with more fire. If there is any\ndisagreement between the sides then we will not reach our conclusion. Let us\nclose the old chapter since Anyanya Iand begin a new chapter. This is not a\ncourt. If it were a court we would enumerate our grievances. If we are committed\nto reconciliation, let us not account for the past. Let us simply enter the\nreconciliation and act as brothers. Let peace multiply as each person accepts\npeace and returns home to plant this seed among his own people. We people of\nRumbek, we have a commissioner. We are following the policy that has been put in\nour mind since the conflict began. We are continuing with it. To conclude my\ntalk, it is that we used quarrelled in the past, but today our conflict is\ndifferent. Ibelieve we are one, we can follow each other's footsteps. We have\nnow accepted reconciliation and peace. If people sit in such a house as this,\nthis is a house of God. And if somebody comes against this you, our brother.\nWhatever the quarrel in the past, let it conclude. My word stops here. PNK: Ithank you for your word, you people of Rumbek. Those of Rumbek are\nleft with 5 minutes. Chief Col Madol Arilpiou will speak in this time. Chief Col Madol Arilpiou: The first person Iwill greet is God. As we are\nhere in this house of God, we have been taught by the Christians. God hates\nJealousy and hatred. God has tied the leg of hatred down now. This jealousy is\ncalled You, our brothers, Nuer, and Jieng, we have been made to collide. The two\npieces of wood that have been put together to cause the fire. God has divided\nthings long ago. He gave Nuer the young cow. He gave Dinka the old cow. This\nbrought conflict, that we must now bring to an end. We Dinka we are willing to\naccept reconciliation with all our hearts, but we have some doubt about our\nbrothers Nuer. You, Nuer, when we have something good, you change it into\nsomething bad the following day. The reason Isay this, is that we went to Bongo\nbecause we have a problem. The Arab claims this land. When we went to Bongo it\nwas because of that problem with the Arabs, but then we began to quarrel among\nourselves. We have killed ourselves in greater numbers than our original enemy\never killed us. The conflict between D&N, has led to the point that the\nwomen are now the ones who die in large numbers. In the old days the men died\nand were eaten by birds, but today the women die. This has come from you Nuer.\nYou are the cause of the death of women. You Malual, you stop that attitude, and\nstop killing women and children for no reason. PNK: The addresses of Rumbek County are finished, and Ithank you three\nchiefs. We have heard your words in full. As well Ithank our brothers Nuer for\nlistening carefully to what has been said. This is not the end of those who will\nspeak. We will continue in the days ahead. Now we turn to the list of Chiefs of\nTonj County which Ihave just received. There are three people: Chief Dut Yol,\nChief Gum Mading Akucbeny, and our mother Sadia Manok. Just now Iinvite Dut Yol\nto come speak. You, people of Tonj County, you have but one hour to speak. Chief Dut Yol: My name is Dut Yol Manyok, a man of Tonj County, and the\nsection of . Iwill not speak at length. What Iwill say first is that Iam\npleased that all our people have gathered here. First Iwill speak about those\nthings that have gone bad between us. Idon't know what has killed me. First of\nall, we have simply been staying with the Nuer. When we went to the bush they\ntook our children. What made them to quarrel in Bongo we still don't understand.\nThose who stayed with us as our brothers, they began to kill us. Some were\nstaying with us and our people tried to kill them, but we refused. Those who\nwanted to return to their homes, we accompanied them. Some are still staying\nwith us today. We have the chief called Mading Manyel who was killed together\nwith his entire family and 18 cattle camps. Also 150 people were killed, and 5\nof our young women were taken who are with them until the present day. When they\ncame they also attacked the section of Det Madheu. They took almost 20,000 head\nof cattle. 90 people were killed at once. Also, during the rainy season, they\ncame and attacked the place of Makuac. When they came back to attack for the\nsecond time they took everything, leaving not even a dog or a chicken. they\nraided the entire cattle camp. All the homesteads were burned, all of Makuac was\nburned to the ground. After 11 days Aboc was raided, Cattle camp of , Wunicuei, Mabior, Aboc, Makuac, Waiyaar CC, Wunicuei, Bikliir. They took all the\nchickens, the women children. Only a few of us remained who ran away. Now that\nyou have come Iam not angry, but happy. If even one person remains, and we have\npeace, that person can multiply. What I'm not happy about is our brother Nuer\nwere the ones to start to explain why they have been killing me. This would have\nbeen far better. We have been reconciled by a man called Telar Ring in a place\ncalled Maal. Why they kill us, we would have preferred if they had spoken first\nso that they can explain precisely why they have killed us as revenge. Since\nthey are with us now, and they all know me. some of them have their children\nstaying with us here. Those children who Ihave accompanied back home, they are\nhome now. Inow want our brothers to speak out the grievances they have against\nme so Ican understand. But the source of our quarrel is this, the Nuer and we\nare one. Idon't look at them as enemies. We share one toc and one border\nbetween us. We regard them as our elders to ourselves because their father is\nelder. When their father was born he could not her but was deaf. When my father\nwas born he was blind. He came in a secret way, my deaf uncle to raid my cattle\nbecause my father could not see. My father went to God and said that this\nbrother comes and steals my cattle. And God said, okay, it is something good.\nGod gave a girl to our Dinka father who was blind. Once he married, he never\nproduced another blind man among his children. And the deaf father of Nuer never\nproduced a deaf man. All their children have been healthy. Idon't know what has\nhappened. After we have produced good children we still carry on this old\ntradition because they have not liberated themselves from the way of their\nfather. Today God went to bring a foreigners and told them, if these two peoples\nquarrel, stand between them, and see why they are quarrelling. Today, especially\nit is the Church leaders who have come here. It is the right time for them to\nask us what our problem is so that it can be resolved between us. What Iknow in\nmy heart this year, after they have killed our children, and killed our\nchildren, and taken all our cattle, and all the goats, after all of this, what\nremains is only their brother who is blind is their brother. They can take their\nblind brother and kill him. This is not the first reconciliation talks. We began\nthem in Gainlel, and again we came to Mal. Today, in Wunlit, this is the third\npeace reconciliation. Those of you who have organised this conference, Iask you\nto invite our brother Nuer to speak out precisely what is in them, why they have\ndestroyed us. You who organised this conference, Iwill not bother to talk about\nthe loss of the cattle, or other property, or dead people. What we want from\nyou, our brothers, are those young girls. Sincerely speaking, Iask you to send\nour girls back, we will console ourselves with them. Please release them to us. The second point to finalise my talk: if we want to be reconciled. Yesterday\nthe white bull was killed. Iwill go back to my home and sit in my house, and\ntry to buy simple goat. My talk is ended, but this point Iwill stress. (Goes across the room to put his house on the head f the old chief. he did\nthis to show that his heart is open, he has nothing remaining, but his heart is\nopen to reconciliation.) PNK: Iam grateful for the word from Chief Dut Yol and for the gift he has\ngiven chief Kuol Muon. At the end of his talk, and as a sign of his\nreconciliation he has offered his had to the Nuer chief. Now we invite Chief Gum\nMading Akucbeny. While we relay our story telling about past events, we also\nwant to point to action we need to take to make peace in the future. We have\nbetween Gum Mading and Chief ... one half an hour. Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny: From the beginning Iwant to tell you this\n(begins to sing his own song, to which people respond; begins by saying, \"Iam\nGum Mading . . .\"). My name is Chief Gum Mading Akucbeny. Ithank God and the\nNSCC for choosing Wunlit as a location for this conference. To my mind a genuine\nreconciliation will not include only D&N, but it must include all Southern\nSudanese. This conference has also provided us with opportunity to meet with our\nchildren who have been cut off from us in Khartoum whom we've not met for a very\nlong time. This conference has also provided an opportunity for our kinfolk in\nEurope and America to come so that we can meet one another. It is very good that\nour children whom we've taken to school to learn English and Arabic have also\ncome to Wunlit, and that all people will now be able to hear that we have met at\nWunlit to bring peace to the land. Yesterday during the opening the military\nauthorities of the SPLA were here and we have seen them. We did not, however,\nknow that there were military and civil administration from Bentiu who were\nlikewise with us. We are glad to hear that there is a military commander coming\ndirectly from where Riak is staying to be in our deliberations, and that he will\nreturn to tell Riak of our progress. The first thing Iwould like to say, concerns we chiefs, who have remained\nwith our people in S. Sudan and sent our children to schools or to Bilpham for\ntraining. The problems that occurred at Bilpham did not begin there, but they\noriginated right here prior to their departure. In 1984 a group of young men\nfrom Gogrial and Tonj began departing for Bilpham. As they went they naturally\nhad to pass through Nuerland. As they reached Abuong they were intercepted. Many\nwere killed and others were drowned while some returned. This had nothing to do\nwith the leadership. In the spirit of reconciliation we must begin with the\ngenesis of the problem. It is not with the leadership. We would like to know the\nchief who was responsible for the killing of our young men as they were en route\nto Bilpham. It is important to begin with the genesis of the problem. That is\nwhy Iasked for the senior military commander. That route through Abuong became\nunsafe for our the passage of our people and we were forced to move any parties\nthrough Bor area as our only alternative route. Ichallenge you, asking someone\nto come and tell me that this is not the real state of affairs, as Ihave\ndescribed it. The route through Bor was a far longer route for our people. When\nwe decide to reconcile and become one, Imust tell you that, currently, we now\nhave two of our people with you in Nuer. They have now devastated Gograil, . . .\nand Tuic areas. When you prepared to come, did you first really speak with them\nto ask what they intend to do. If we are sincere about reconciliation Iaddress\nmyself to those from Nuer area. You have with us Carbino Kwanyiny Bol and Matip.\nDoes it really make sense for us to reconcile if they are not with us, because\nthese two people are with you now. If we reconcile without their participation Ibelieve our efforts will be incomplete. s we are all Southerners, we have lost\nour women and children, cattle and properties. Iam glad to here that the\nCommissioner from Bentiu is here with us. As you saw yesterday, we have\nresponsible people with us here from our side. Iwould hope we can also speak\nwith Riak Machar to tell him that we as Southerners have lost everything we\npossess through our conflicts. First let us be practical, you the chiefs from Nand from D. As you have seen yesterday, we don't have an army. Yesterday\nGovernor Nhial Deng Nhial and Commander Selva Kiir were here to guard any\nagreement we come to in this place. What about you? Who will ensure that our\nagreement stands firm in your areas? When Chief Majok came here . . . Tell me,\nif we go to your area will we find that our Dinka are still alive there? As Isaid before, the Nuer are here with their property, they are here with their\ncattle and their children. If you want to take them with you are welcome to take\nthem. But Iwould only ask that you reciprocate, allowing our Dinka people to\nreturn to us also. Iconclude with greetings, and emphasise before the\norganisers, that this peace and reconciliation will be monitored, so that the\nDinka can go to Nuerland and claim their properties and likewise the Nuer can\ncome to Dinkaland to receive what belongs from them. PNK: Ithank the two chiefs who have spoken now for their penetrating\ninsights. Ithank the Nuer for listening patiently to the presentation of the\nDinka chiefs. Among the speakers from Tonj Country is Sadia . . . and in the\nspirit of this conference we would also like to hear the voice of our women. We\nwill begin tomorrow at 9:00 again hearing the narratives of the Dinka. We will\ngive three hours for the remainder of the presentations from the Dinka. Although\nthe time allotted to the representatives from Tong is finished, will give a\nbrief opportunity to Sadia to speak. Ithank you all for your participation\ntoday."}]}

At the start of their latest tour, Nick Greenslade meets key players on both sides, from past and present, to discover why the All Blacks offer the defining test in world rugby Sunday    June      5, 2005 Observer Sport Monthly If the British and Irish Lions were ever to create an official team slogan, and in an age when you regularly hear talk of the Lions 'brand' that may not be too far off, then it could be, 'How to win friends and influence people'. Take the great squad who travelled to New Zealand in 1971. They are lauded not just because they were the first and only squad from these islands to win a series in a country where rugby is the national obsession, but also because of the influence they exerted on the domestic audience.

But these Lions were different: with flair, determination and panache they at first stunned and then seduced the home crowd. 'It would be hard to overestimate their impact on New Zealand rugby,' says Sean Fitzpatrick, a World Cup winner in 1987 and All Blacks captain for much of the Nineties. 'Let me give you two examples, one tactical and one personal. Prior to that tour, everyone had tried to kick like [New Zealand full-back] Don Clarke, who was a legend as far as we were concerned. You ran up to the ball and hoofed it as hard as you could, as he did. Then along came Barry John, the Lions fly-half.' Fitzpatrick recalls the Wales player's unique 'round the corner' kicking style, as he puts it. 'It wasn't just that it was different. It was that it worked so well. After that, it was farewell to Don. Iwas a huge fan of Gareth Edwards, too. Ieven bought myself a red jersey so that when my brother and Iplayed in the garden, he would be the All Blacks and Iwould be the Lions or Wales.'"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The Lions' victory was a wake-up call to New Zealanders, a reminder that obsession did not necessarily equate to dominance and that the same mistake could not be allowed to recur. No one felt this more acutely than Fitzpatrick himself, as captain in 1993. After going one up in a three-match series against the Lions, the All Blacks surrendered the second Test 20-7, leaving themselves just a week to recover and avoid the fate of the losing 1971 side. 'Isaid to the Lions captain, Gavin Hastings, almost immediately after the final whistle, \"Just you watch how the country turns on the All Blacks\". And it did. The week leading up to the series decider was comfortably the worst week of my life. That we won the final Test was entirely down to the fact that we each knew we wouldn't be able to face the country if we lost.' In 1974, the Lions travelled to apartheid South Africa. If New Zealand was the heart of rugby, then South Africa was its muscles and bones, a place where superiority had to be asserted through physical ascendancy. It was 'unmanly' to play any other way. 'Idon't think the South Africans had any idea how much British forward play had improved,' recalls Wales's Mervyn Davies, a key member of a pack that absorbed then repelled a series of ferocious Springbok assaults. Grudgingly - and having watched their team lose the four-match Test series 3-0 they had little choice - the native volk conceded their side's inferiority. Far readier to accord respect to the Lions were the black townships, who supported the Lions because they identified them as their 'enemy's enemy'. The bond between the two groups was sealed when a township side became one of the few South African teams to cross the tourists' try line during the tour. In the early seventies, a Lions tour offered the opportunity to play in a country that few of the team had even visited. For those in the southern hemisphere, it afforded a rare glimpse of the best players from the north. Today, the international rugby calendar is cluttered with teams from these islands heading south to play South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. But these are not tours, at least not in the traditional sense. The back-to-back Tests, crammed into an already tight schedule to satisfy the demand of television networks, are over too quickly. The players spend most of their time in hotels and airports. A Lions tour should be and is different. The sportswriter John Hopkins oncedescribed it as 'a cross between a medieval crusade and a prep school outing'. Hopkins was no doubt thinking about the very first tour, to New Zealand in 1888 - a tour that, boat transportation included, lasted eight months. But he could have been writing about the 1971 tour: 26 matches not just in New Zealand but also in Australia (then considered a gentle warm-up), occupying nearly three months. This was when players, locals and journalists would mingle freely. Frank Keating, of the Guardian, has written of how the press of the day would allow the impoverished amateur players use of their hotel phones to call home. Professionalism has changed all that. The players in New Zealand with the Lions have everything they want. They are comfortable and well paid. Many of them have newspaper columns and sponsorship deals. And yet the point about touring is that it is not meant to be easy. As the 1997 Lions assistant coach, Jim Telfer, warned his men: 'It's a bit like when the British and Irish go abroad. The first thing they look for is a pint of Guinness. The second is a plate of fish and chips. The next thing they do is look for another British or Irish person. That won't do for me and it won't do for you.' Four years later, in Australia, this counsel appeared to have been ignored. If the official tour video can be believed, the closest that the 2001 Lions party came to immersing themselves in the wider culture was a few rounds of golf and a trip to the set of Neighbours. There are many reasons why that particular tour broke up in bitter recrimination, but one of them must be the management's unwillingness to allow the players time off, to encourage them to explore the local history and society. Compare that with Steve Waugh's Aussie cricketers who, at the same time, were making their way to England for the Ashes series but stopped off at Gallipoli to pay their respects to their fallen countrymen. Clive Woodward, coach of this year's Lions, seems eager to atone. At the press conference to announce his squad in April, he declared: 'We will be working with the New Zealand authorities to set up a full social programme. We want this set of Lions to be remembered as much for how they conducted themselves off the field as on it.' Woodward may well be pushing at an open door. 'There was outcry when Clive said that his team would be based in Auckland and fly out for any matches further afield,' says Sean Fitzpatrick, who will be commentating on the series for Sky. 'That's why Iwas delighted when he flew back last Christmas and said that the squad would be travelling around the districts. We want these guys in our community. We want the kids to be able to say they touched them. Lions tours only come to our country every 12 years so it's important that the next generation of rugby players gets a glimpse of them. Just as Iwas inspired by Gareth Edwards in 1971, there will be kids who will get a huge lift from seeing Jonny Wilkinson or Brian O'Driscoll play or train.' In truth, it will not be the Lions' external profile that most occupies Woodward in the forthcoming weeks - that's where Alastair Campbell, his controversial appointment as communications chief, will be required - but the more difficult task of maintaining internal harmony. Afew months ago, Iwas talking to former Ireland captain Keith Wood, a leading figure on the tours of 1997 and 2001. When Imade a casual reference to the British Lions, he immediately interrupted. 'Ithink you mean the British and Irish Lions,' he said. His intervention was a reminder that bringing together players from four different countries into a cohesive unit in less than two months, which is difficult enough, can be complicated further by politics and national rivalries. It is easy to forget how acute tensions were between the home unions at the turn of the 1990s as the Welsh struggled to come to terms with their own decline and as Scotland and England competed for supremacy. 'You'd have the English in one corner, the Welsh in another, and the Scots and the Irish laughing about how much they were going to drink on tour,' says Scott Hastings, the Scotland centre who was part of the 1989 and 1993 campaigns. It is believed that the decision to award the captaincy of the 1993 tour to Gavin Hastings, instead of Will Carling, was made on the basis that few of the Celts in the party felt comfortable about playing under an English captain. Eight years later, in Australia, it was the turn of the Welsh to assert their tribalism. There is a story that when an English player sat down for breakfast with his team-mates from the Principality, they began to speak in Welsh. Perhaps more difficult for Woodward will be the task of making all 45 members of his party feel integrated and involved when only half can be selected in the Test squad. The Lions coach has said that he does not yet know the identity of the 22 players who will be chosen for the first Test squad. We should take him at his word. But there will come a point - no later than a fortnight hence - when the likely make-up of that starting squad will emerge. It is then that his powers of conciliation will be most tested. It is not clear when the term 'dirt-tracker' first surfaced, but it was popularised on the last Lions tour to New Zealand in 1993, when a rump of between 10 and 12 players were left feeling redundant and disillusioned. 'Ithink one of the saddest sights I've ever seen in rugby,' former England and Lions hooker Brian Moore says, 'was that of the midweek team being led off for a swim by one of the management while the Test team went through a private training session.' The performances of the midweek side in the games that preceded the second and third Tests were among the poorest in the Lions' proud history. Stuart Barnes, captain of the 'dirt-trackers', could not hide his disgust: 'Icould never contemplate giving up like some of them did. Ifeel humiliated. It just didn't mean enough for some of our team to play for the Lions.' And yet the dirt trackers can help bolster morale. Never was this more apparent than in Australia in 1989. 'It was that midweek team that kept the tour on track,' says Ieuan Evans, the former Wales wing and a veteran of three tours. 'We had taken a hammering in the first Test and the way they went out and performed straight afterwards lifted everyone. They were called Donal's Donuts [after captain Donal Lenihan], but there was nothing soft about them.' From there, the Lions won the second and third Tests to become the only side to win a series after losing the opening match. Among the various battles that make the forthcoming series so exciting is that between the rival coaches: Clive Woodward, the World Cup-winner eager to enjoy one final honour in rugby before turning to football, against Graham Henry, the New Zealander who was in charge of Wales then picked to coach the Lions on that difficult and fractious 2001 tour of Australia. Henry was the first 'foreigner' to coach the Lions and there was the inevitable backlash, even from within his own camp. 'That was one of the toughest periods of my life, no doubt about it,' Henry told me in Auckland in March. 'Ihad barely given a moment's thought to the Lions job in the 2000-01 season because Ididn't think they would pick an overseas coach. When my appointment was confirmed, there were quite a few former Lions queuing up to say what a bad move it was. That was understandable. Ididn't mind. Ijust felt humbled and privileged to have the job.' None of this would have mattered had he returned home victorious from Australia. He did not. After a wonderful win in the first Test in Melbourne, the Lions were soundly defeated by the Wallabies in the following game and narrowly lost the deciding match. 'Maybe because Iwas an outsider, it made me an easy target when we lost the series.' Yet even if Henry had won the series, there are grounds for believing that he would still have been a target. It is well documented that a cluster of squad members disliked him and his methods. Both in and outside the camp, there was a widespread feeling that the coach had already decided on his Test team even before the squad had departed for Australia. As in New Zealand in 1993, those who believed that they were surplus to requirements soon dissolved into truculent discontent. The very public spokesmen of this fifth column were Matt Dawson and Austin Healey. Both Englishmen could start a fight in an empty house so the New Zealander could have shrugged off their criticisms. More problematic for Henry were the reservations of England and Lions captain Martin Johnson, who would later write in his autobiography: 'If the management had decided to send Matt [Dawson] home, Iwould have been on the plane next to him and so would a lot of the other guys.' It was hardly an endorsement of Henry's leadership. The contrast between Henry and Woodward could not be more marked. The former England coach is the business entrepreneur, ever willing to look beyond rugby for new ideas and to experiment with technology, management consultants and the military to achieve a competitive edge. Henry is a former headmaster and the absence of a corporate background in his CV is thought to have cost him his first chance of coaching the All Blacks when, in 1995, the game turned professional. He distrusts journalists and can often appear guarded and surly. It is impossible to imagine him employing Alastair Campbell, for example, as Woodward has done. Yet he seems more relaxed now, possibly because he is back among his own and because he finally has the job that he always coveted and few dispute his right to hold. If there is a general indictment of Henry's regime with the Lions, however, it is that he overworked his players. Jason Robinson and Keith Wood both told me that the relentless training sessions imposed by the management exhausted a squad already weakened with injury. An opposing view is voiced by current acting England captain, Martin Corry. 'Iwouldn't necessarily agree that we were overworked,' he says. 'You have to remember that you've got players from four different nations, all used to playing in different attacking and defensive systems. The only way you can mould them together in one uniform style in such a short space of time is to put in the hours on the training pitch. If Ihad to summarise the problem with that tour, it was that the players didn't see it through the management's eyes and vice-versa.' Corry is a useful point of reference because, despite only making it on to the tour as an injury replacement and being marked down as a dirt-tracker, he worked his way into the Test team. 'Ionly arrived out in Australia at the end of the first week of the tour but Isoon sensed the tension in the squad,' he recalls. 'The problem was that the coaches placed so much emphasis on winning the Tests. We could have lost all the provincial games and won the Test series 2-1 and that would have been a good tour as far as they were concerned. When you make such a stark distinction, then the guys who aren't in the Test side will inevitably start to feel like secondary citizens. Unfortunately, it only takes one player to complain for the whole negative vibe to start to spread. Ithink you'll find that a lot of the guys who felt unhappy were those who had been on the 1997 tour in South Africa, which was successful. Ihad nothing to compare it with so Iwas just happy to be there.' Henry is at least prepared to acknowledge Corry's point, albeit obliquely: 'Iconcentrated on winning rather than individuals. That tour was the biggest learning curve of my career.' Yet the sour note on which that experience ended has been replaced by a renewed relish. 'This is the biggest rugby, no, sporting event we have had in this country since the 1987 World Cup,' he says now. 'It should be the ambition of every southern-hemisphere player to face the Lions. None of our guys has ever faced them before and with the Lions not coming to New Zealand again for another 12 years, they probably won't get a second chance. So you would hope that everyone would be busting a gut to make this team and to do the same once they're in.' It is an intimidating prospect. Yet you know that Clive Woodward would not want it to be any other way. · Nick Greenslade is assistant editor of Observer Sport Monthly Match dates 4 June v Bay of Plenty, International Stadium, Rotorua 8 June v Taranaki, Yarrow Stadium, New Plymouth 11 June v New Zealand Maori, Waikato Stadium, Hamilton 15 June v Wellington, Westpac Stadium 18 June v Otago, Carisbrook, Dunedin 21 June v Southland, Rugby Park Stadium, Invercargill 25 June v New Zealand, Jade Stadium, Christchurch first test 28 June v Manawatu, Arena Manawatu, Palmerston North 2 July v New Zealand, Westpac Stadium, Wellington second test 5 July v Auckland, Eden Park 9 July v New Zealand, Eden Park, Auckland third test All matches kick off at 0810 BST and are shown on Sky Sports Twenty thousand Lions supporters will travel to New Zealand.

Rangers’ win in the Old firm derby re-ignited their own challenge for the SPL title, while magnificent results for our European representatives in midweek meant that, for once, we have a realistic chance of watching more than one of our club sides competing in the latter stages of the UEFA Cup. While the back pages of our national press should have filled with morale-boosting tales of these exhilarating triumphs, the spectre of sectarianism and racism has raised its ugly head again, instantly dislacing the feel-good factor that all involved with the Scottish game should be currently experiencing. Unfortunately, the sickening examples of intolerable prejudice that have been highlighted in our country recently have been replicated in other European countries. There was the despicable abuse meted out to England’s black players in Spain, and down south a Blackburn fan was in court over his racist abuse of Birmingham striker Dwight Yorke. The fact that Yorke had previously been an outstanding goalscorer for the Ewood Park side, and most probably a revered favourite of his abuser, makes the incident all the more ridiculous and incomprehensible. Scotland in the 21st century is an ever-increasingly multi- cultural assemblage of people who profess to varying creeds and possess differing tones of skin pigmentation. Scottish football mimics this growing diversity with a growing number of players and fans with ethnic origins and religious beliefs which are different from the white men who have traditionally made up the British footballing community. Yet no matter where they come from or what colour they are, every football fan can still identify a sub-standard player from the terraces, and, as a cash-splashing stakeholder in our beautiful game, is well within their rights to loudly vent their opinions on a player’s inadequate display. But it is when a sectarian or racist expletive is added to their harangue that the line has been crossed and acceptable criticism from the stand degenerates into a vile personal onslaught. Athick skin is a necessary prerequisite for all wannabe professional footballers - we all know that there will be regular assassination of our on-field qualities from both supporters and coaching staff. In fact, many players channel the criticism, and find that the passionate pelters help them achieve a greater level of performance than they could ever have otherwise managed. Enjoying an after-match refreshment with my former Dundee team-mate Noel Blake, Imade a mental note to maximise the effort in my performance in the upcoming Dundee derby when an idiotic United fan relentlessly chided myself and Noel over our supposed shortcomings. Noel regarded the situation with his customary grin until the brainless fan then drew attention to the fact that Noel’s complexion was darker than the ruddy exterior of his harasser. Idiotic to bring race into an argument and idiotic to do so with a man who could easily have been mistaken for Marvin Hagler’s twin brother. The incident which saw Dundee ban one of its season ticket holders from Dens for life for verbally abusing two black Celtic players showed that there are means to curtail the despicable actions of a mindless minority. The hard line taken by Dundee in that instance served as an example to any other fans who feel that it is acceptable to have a go at an opposition player on account of the colour of his skin. And the fact that it was an appalled 14-year-old Dundee fan who brought the moronic outburst to the attention of the authorities proves that there are ways that decent supporters can play their part. At Partick, we have three black players on our books: Jean-Yves Anis and Armand One from the Ivory Coast and the magnificently-named Emmanuel Panther, brought up in not so exotic Maryhill and boasting an accent that would not be out of place on River City. In conversation with them on the subject recently, they assured me that there have been few occasions in their careers when they have been subjected to racial abuse. Unfortunately my ex-Livingston team-mate Brian McPhee has not been so lucky. He has the regrettable distinction of seeing fans of visiting sides end up in court two weeks in succession for spouting race-based vitriol in his direction. During my tenure as a Dunfermline player, the reputation of the Pars was tarnished when our black central defender Dave Barnett asked to be released from his contract on the grounds that he could no longer work within our allegedly racist environment. The front pages of the tabloid press were covered with Barnett’s racist claims, much to the bemusement of the staff at East End Park, and particularly our general manager Paul D’Mello, who also happens to be black. It was to everyone’s surprise, then, that when pre-season training commenced the following campaign, Dave was seated back in our apparently racist dressing-room having been granted permission by the Pars bosses to engage in our fitness conditioning. Race was never a problem during my time with the Pars, as Iam sure even Dave would now acknowledge. As Irecall, the only burning crosses Iencountered at East End then were the ones that skelped off my forehead having been fired from the scintillating left foot of our rotund wing wizard Stewart Petrie.

All he's retiring from is Cup competition, calling his final season in 2005 the \"My Salute to You\" tour. He still intends to continue as a driver, just in a less pressure-packed circuit – perhaps the Craftsman Truck Series, which he described as \"kind of interesting.\" \"Iwant to step out where I'm at the top of my game,\" Martin said. \"Iwanted to go out that way, instead of on the decline.

Martin was also one of the key players in helping put NASCAR on the road to becoming what it is today: the second-most popular spectator sport in the country. \"Mark is leaving a heritage that will exist forever in our sport, and that's a great and positive and wonderful thing,\" NASCAR president Mike Helton said. \"The tough part is he'll be missed, certainly, walking around the garage with a uniform on, or in the driver's meeting, or at the level of chasing the Nextel Cup. \"Idon't know if the true value of a Mark Martin will ever be realized and it's unfortunate because the state of NASCAR today is because of the character that Mark Martin portrays.\" That Martin would decide to retire from Cup racing after next season caught many people by surprise. As late as last season, he said he might continue racing through 2006 or 2007. But the pressure brought on by NASCAR's inaugural Chase for the Nextel Cup has taken a toll on the 45-year-old Martin. \"Chasing for the Cup in 2004 has definitely been the most consuming season of my life,\" said Martin, who enters this Saturday night's UAW-GM Quality 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in fifth place in the standings. \"No one can understand how important it has been for me to be a contender, and we have the opportunity in 2004 to go win this championship.\" And if he falls short of that goal by season's end? Well, there's always next year. \"2005 looks like the best-ever for me and my team,\" he said. \"2005 for me is about commitment, racing for a championship for one last time for the Nextel Cup.\" While he has finished seasons runner-up a NASCAR-record four  times and recorded 213 top-five and 338 top-10 finishes in 596 career Cup starts, Martin, who will make his 600th career start at Phoenix early next month, has never won a Cup championship. While there's some lament in his voice, he tries not to let his body language betray his disappointment. \"There are a lot of guys out there who never got to win their first race in NASCAR and I've been fortunate to accomplish a lot of things,\" Martin said. \"Inever worry about the things that Ihaven't done, instead Ifocus on all the things that I've been able to do and that makes me very proud.\" Still, Martin plays it humble in the face of all his accomplishments. \"One of the reasons for my stepping out of the Cup series at this time is because Inever really was convinced deep down inside that Iwas all that good,\" Martin said. \"Ithink I've fooled a lot of people for a long, long time, and Idon't want to take a chance on getting caught up in something where everybody figures out that Iwas a sham and Ireally wasn't as good as the results Igot.\" Well, if that's indeed true, Mark, you certainly did a heck of a job fooling so many of us for so long.

Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd.  has come up with an interesting twist on this principle, one in which air pressure itself (\"aerodynamic-drive technology\") is used to control the diaphragm.  The result is a transparent panel speaker called the \"Sound Window,\" announced by the Japanese industrial giant March 27. The invention is intended to mate acoustic radiating surfaces with video displays, enabling the launch of sound and image from the same surface—or at least, from two closely-spaced surfaces—thereby eliminating the need for the deep cavities required to house traditional moving-coil drivers.  The goal is maximum performance with minimal energy expenditure from an integrated audio/video source with shallow depth—in other words, a television-like device that can be hung on the wall like a framed picture. Sound Windows employ a lightweight transparent panel suspended a fraction of an inch from another surface, such as a video screen.  The sound pressure from a small conventional cone driver acoustically vibrates the transparent panel, which can be 10 times—or more—greater in diaphragm area.  The aerodynamic-drive technology is said to ensure sound-pressure transmission to the entire panel surface.  Matsushita claims this \"acoustic leverage technology\" enables the Sound Window to operate on as little as 1/25 the power a conventional driver would require.  Panel shape isn't critical, the manufacturer states. With varying degrees of success, other manufacturers have experimented with flat-panel speakers.  Matsushita claims that the Sound Window is the industry's first speaker \"that reproduces sound by pneumatically vibrating a transparent panel using aerodynamic-drive technology.\" The device appears to offer the most promise for use in small communications products, such as cell phones, personal digital assistants, and laptop computers.  The Sound Window's extremely low power consumption would appear to make it ideal for such applications.  Matshushita plans to ship the first Sound Window products to industrial customers later this year. Matsushita doesn't specify the frequency response, distortion level, or output capability of the Sound Window.  Presumably, none of these specifications is audiophile grade, but the ingenious device proves that new designs for sound generation are possible for inventors who think outside the box.  Acomplete press release, including an operation diagram, can be seen here ."}]}
{"file_number": "174", "plaintext": [{"tag": "h2", "text": "October 08, 2004"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "The Town Hall Presidential Debate"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This debate ought to provide more entertainment and more candid information than the last two. I’m also not as skeptical about Charlie Gibson than others. Ithink his influence on the questions will be fairly minimal. I’m updating frequently, so come back often. Check Blogs for Bush for a list of other livebloggers and hit them often. Get a lot of opinions as we go along. And don’t forget that Blogs for Bush is also liveblogging with a roundtable. Updates happen there, as well as here. Heck - keep a few browser windows open tonight. It’ll be fun! Here we go. 1) Are you wishy-washy? Kerry didn’t answer this question beyond a “No”. He did launch a pretty boilerplate attack on the President. The President replied with his own boilerplate. Kerry’s problem is that Bush’s boilerplate packs punch. 2) Aquestion about Iraq - was there a threat, even with no WMDs found? President first.  It was a nice move of him to note that September 11 changed the dynamic. Another good point about how Hussein was working to lift sanctions so he could resume his programs. He also is showing a lot of emotion on this question. That could play well (but may play negatively elsewhere). Now Kerry. The world is more dangerous today because the President make the wrong judgements. Kerry is saying that he says Kerry’s changed his mind because he can’t address jobs, or NCLB. “I’ve never changed my mind about Iraq…but Iowuld have used that force…that authority wisely. Iwould have brought our allies to our side. This President rushed to war…and Iran now is more dangerous and so is North Korea”. This one really is a loser for Kerry. Bush rebuts by bringing up the “global test” from the last debate. “That’s the kind of mindset that says let’s keep it at the United Nations and hope things go well… Sanctions were not working. The United Nations was not effective”. The candidates are going directly at each other now. Ithink this plays better to Kerry right now than to the President. 3) Another Iraq question - would you proceed in Iraq with the same plan as the President? Kerry quotes King Abdullah (?) in saying that you can’t hold elections in Iraq and quotes Republican Chuck Hegel also (nice job, Chuck!). “He pushes them away”. Bush has to confront the notion that the President pushed away our allies. I’m guessing that he ought to bring up the Oil for Food bribery scheme sooner rather than later. He’s going to get Iraqi training done faster and get our allies back. Note that he didn’t say how. Were Ithe President I’d ask him directly how he’d do that. S**t or get off the pot, in other words. The President is leading off with a strong card - PM Allawi. “My opponent says he has a plan. It sounds familiar. It’s called the Bush Plan”. He’s also deriding the idea of a summit to ask people to help us in a war that is a mistake. “Iknow how these people think. Imeet with them all the time…they’re not going to follow an American President who says ‘Follow me into a mistake’”. Kerry follows up by saying that the right war was in Tora Bora. “That was the reason Congress gave him the authority to use force” - speaking of WMDs. Idon’t recall that being accurate. “First of all, we didn’t find out he didn’t have weapons until we got there”. Nice comeback from the President but he could be more direct on the Monday Morning Quarterbacking that Kerry and Edwards are doing. 4) About anti-Americanism and how we handled the Iraq situation - especially diplomacy. The President made an interesting admission: that he made decisions he knew would make America unpopular, but that he made them because they were in the right interests of the country. He’s also addressing his reasons for not engaging Arafat and how it was unpopular in Europe but that it was the right decision. This kind of stuff works very well for him. Ican almost predict the Kerry rebuttal. It’s a good point to note that there are 30 nations in Iraq and 40 in Afghanistan. Another good point is that the President ought not to take decisions because it’s popular but because it’s right. Kerry’s saying that the President is promising us more of the same over the next four years. Well, of course! Promising different than that is Kerry’s job. His point is that the President doesn’t listen to advice and that he does. Kerry also hits hard on the President not “winning the peace”. 5) Aquestion about Iran - what will you do as President in Iran. Kerry: “Idon’t think you can just rely on UN sanctions”. Didn’t he just say that he wanted to rely on sanctions in Iraq? Bush really needs to jump on that hard. More on bunker-busters. “That answer almost made me want to scowl” - great aside from the President. Agood note that we’re now doing in Iran what John Kerry wanted us to do - diplomacy and multilateralism. He also hits Kerry hard on his wanting bilteral talks with the multilateral talks in place. (Ijust realized something. This would be more fun if Iblogged it with lots of wrestling lingo. So here we go! *DingDING!*) 6) Aquestion about policing the world and the draft. Ouch. Bush said the word “internet” lie he’d never heard it before. But it was good for him to be emphatic about now having the draft. He’s talking about how we’re moving our troops around to make them more efficient to meet a new threat. That’s a good point and one that hasn’t been made very often lately. Whoa! Bush just jumped in and probably broke a rule to bring a “foreign object” into the debate. He ticked off countries involved in the Coalition and said you can’t denigrate them and lead. Kerry barely fended that off, but he’s bleeding. 7) Aquestion about terrorism - why have there been no terrorist attacks since 9/11 and how will you keep us safe? Kerry’s answer: he can’t say. “We’ve been told that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ but a matter of ‘when” terrorist attacks will happen. And it’s also a matter of taxes. Did Kerry just say we’re not safer because Bush gave rich people a tax cut? Huh? He missed the hold entirely. Bush comes back with a great reversal noting that we have tripled the Homeland Security budget then whaps him off the turnbuckle by noting Kerry’s voting against intelligence budgets. “The test is not if you add money…”. Huh? Kerry seems to be fighting a different match here. Maybe he doesn’t realize this is a Hardcore Match for the Belt!! 8) Aquesiton about health issues - why block Canadian prescription drugs. “Ihaven’t yet. Ijust want to make sure they’re safe”. He could have done without the word “yet” in that sentence, don’t you think? And wouldn’t it have been better if he hadn’t mentioned how it’s the government’s job to protect us? Maybe he’s getting winded here. He has a couple small cuts from the last question, but nothing serious. Generic drugs are good but the senior drug discount card isn’t a big winner, but it’s what he has. He needs to learn a better move to deal with this issue. Ah! The President is courageous for taking on Medicare? Well, maybe. Kerry’s up and spinning off the ropes right now. The President isn’t paying any attention. Kerry’s just cracking his head off the turnbuckle over and over again on this issue. “I’m fighting for the middle class”. Ouch. Bush invokes President Clinton, but it’s not a good diversion. But this one is: “Show me one accomplishment he’s made toward Medicare”. “We did someting you don’t know how to do: we balanced the budget”. Kerry’s also taking credit for the jobs created in the 1990s and for the low deficit. Nice bit of diversion there while he goes for the brass knucks. 9) Aquestion about health care - Kerry’s choice of Vice President suing doctors in the past. Kerry copped to being a lawyer - not a very good move. Expect the President not to be under this five-star splash when Kerry’s finished. He can give everyone healthcare if we roll back the tax cut. The President looks a bit uncertain and doesn’t come out strong. Nice recovery though noting how Kerry wasn’t around to make vital votes on healthcare. Whoa! Lawsuits cost us 28 billion dollars a year? That’s an awful lot if it’s accurate. And it’s a good point to note that having the government in charge of health care is a bad idea. 10)  Aquestion about lawsuits - capping damages Kerry: Yes, sure, kind of. Back to the President. Did the President really cut kids from health care? Really? Ibet he didn’t. Bush: Ouch!! What a move (If Kerry thought this was such an important issue, he probably should have showed up and vote for it) 11) Aquestion about the deficit - How is the President’s spending better than Kerry’s. Bush hits the recession and the war that have cost us money. He also hits the tax cuts for everybody . Bet that Kerry will come back with a “tax cuts for the rich” Non-defense, non-homeland security discretionary spending has increased by one percent. Err…Idon’t know that’s right. It could be, but it sounds wrong. Kerry’s refining hs view on his government health care program. “If you like your high premiums, you keep ‘em”. Wasn’t that just a touch condescending? Bingo! If you’re playing the drinking game where Kerry talks about the tax cut for the rich, you should be drunk by now. Gibson’s follow up on how they’ll cut the deficit because they’ve given no plans. Bush comes out by noting the situation he faced when he came into office. It’s a good point but he’s not there long enough. He’s letting Kerry out of the hold far too early on this issue and Kerry’s just reversed him. I’m sure the President can put up some good offense on this issue, but he’s not. 12) Aquestion about taxes - will yo promise not to raise taxes on people under 200,000 dollars a year. Kerry’s now talking about his tax cuts. Both of them: child tax credit and tuition credit. Well, that’s something, isn’t it? Kind of a weak bounce off the ropes and my guess is the President has a clothesline waiting for him. “The President broke the ‘pay as you go’ rule”? What rule? “You have to stand up and fight somewhere, folks”. Wow. Ican’t believe he actually said that. Looks like Kerry’s making a big “face turn”. But those rich folks are going to get a tax increase. Okay, the President is using Kerry’s record against him. It’s a mudhole stomping of epic proportion! Well, almost. He broke his own momentum…again. The same follow-up from Gibson. Kerry. Oh yes, the “fuzzy math” figure about Kerry’s spending proposal. And a commission about corporate loopholes. Bush: “You can run, but you can’t hide [from his record]”.  Ouch. Another big cut open on Kerry. 13) Aquestion about the environment and pollution. This is Bush’s weak spot, Ithink. Others disagree but Idon’t think he’s going to make much traction here. ON the other hand, neither does Kerry. We’ll have to watch them circle each other for a question before they lock up again. Oh wait. The Kyoto Treaty. Bush missed the chance to point out how Kerry didn’t vote for it. Kerry says “Iwas there” in Kyoto and says the President didn’t try to fix it. An odd exchange. 14) Aquestion about jobs - wages and competition. Kerry: “There are a lot of ways to be competetive…” Yes, there are. Will he mention any of them or will he just go back on the attack? Erg. Attack. We can be competetive by dealing with the costs of health care. You think that Kerry believes his health care plan is his strong point. Yay! Take another “tax cut for the rich” drink! Watch your alcohol level, though. You could get dangerously close to an alcohol coma. And energy independence! And an entrepreneurial spirit! Nothing on wages and competetiveness. More on health care. I’m not sure this is germane to business itself but I’ll let them wander around the ring a bit before Istart booing them both. This is definitely the lull in the match tonight. And did Kerry just say he couldn’t stop outsourcing? Finally, finally, finally - Bush notes that his tax increase will hit small businesses. Oh but it’s not true, according to the Wall Street Journal - so says Kerry. And now being a small business is a tax dodge, according to Kerry/ He just said something about the President owning a timber company. What the heck was that? “Iown a timber company? That’s news to me!”. OH MY GOD! HE’S BROKEN HIM IN HALF! 15)  Aquestion about security - and a leading one about the PATRIOT Act. Gee. Think the guy’s against it? Nice polite deflection from the President - “Idon’t think you’re rights are being taken away”. This is a pretty fair defense of the Act, noting just how the Act is germane to dealing with terrorism in the country. Kerry invokes a couple Republicans about “fixing” the Act. “People’s rights have been abused”, and he gives an example. And here’s the laundry list of ways rights have been eroded. They’re easy enough to knock down. “Ibelieve in the PATRIOT Act”. John Kerry just hit himself in the head with a folding chair! He’s weaving! He just obliterated his entire rebuttal with that one short statement. 16) Aquestion about stem cells - embryonic stem cells versus those not destroying an embryo. Kerry’s just assumed that she’s a pro-lifer and had to stop hard before he made the overt assumption. That didn’t look good at all. He’s not actually answering the question, though. He hasn’t said why embryonic stem cells are better than any others. That’s the real question here and he’s not answering it. And he vapor locked about things he could cure with stem cells. Maybe because there aren’t so many? Bush comes out strong and somber on tihs, noting that he’s the first President to have Federal funding on stem cell research. Kerry apparently just said he’d use embryos in fertility clinics. Don’t those already belong to someone? Would he have the government seize them? Kerry reverses very strong by saying that the President doesn’t want to destroy life, except the stem cells that already exist. Bush counters with a ringing note that the stem cell lines already in use are dead already. 17) Aquestion about the Supreme Court - who would he choose and why. He can’t answer the question because he doesn’t have a name in mind yet. Nice disarming answer. But he’s moving into the traits he wants: someone who’ll not let personal beliefs get in the way of a decision. And he’s using the Pledge of Alliegance and Dred Scott decisions as examples of the judges he wouldn’t choose because it was personal opinion. Whoa. He almost made a Constitutional point by quoting the Declaration of Independence. “No litmus test except for how they will interpret the Constitution”. That a very concise line he can use again often. Kerry’s attacking with what he said a few years ago. He wants a Justice who is a good judge. Well, that’s a nice inoffensive statement to make. But the laundry list he notes (and he noted “women’s rights to choose” and “reproductive rights” in that list. Aren’t they the same?) seems liberal enough to me. 18) Aquestion about abortion - what would you say to someone who didn’t want their tax dollars going to abortion. Kerry’s starting out by noting he’s a Catholic. He says he can’t legislate his faith. That doesn’t answer the question, though, which wasn’t about making abortion illegal but by forcing people to pay for abortion with their tax dollars. Wait. He just said that we ought to help poor people get their Constitutionally-approved abortion if they can’t pay for it themselves. Did he really mean that? Bush: “I’m trying to decipher that”. Yeah, so are the rest of us. “I’m not going to spend federal money to pay for abortions”. Kerry’s comeback is on points like parental notification and rape and incest exceptions. “It’s never quite as simple as the President wants youto believe”. WHACK! Bush just hit him again by noting that “yes” and “no” are pretty simple options on partial birth abortions. Kerry’s wearing the famed “red mask” right now. This was a good exchange and really did note the differences between the two men. 19) Ageneral question - when did you make a mistake and how did you correct it, and give three examples. Bush: “I’m human. But on the big question…I’ll stand by those decisions because Ithink they were right”. He boils it down to being a question on Iraq and uses the Duelfer Report to defend himself. That was a good move to restate and clarify his position. And he’s going to bring up the tax cut, too. This is a really good defense. He made mistakes on appointments, but he won’t name names. Hmm..Iwonder if he might be talking about people like Richard Clarke and his former Secretary of the Treasury? Now Kerry’s going to give three mistakes the President made. He asks us to look into our hearts and ask if going to war was really the last resort. Idon’t think he wants to do that, does he? Hmm..Kerry just hit himself in the head again. “Imade a mistake in how Italked about it….” then talked about his votes. Voting isn’t talking, Senator. 20) Closing statements. Kerry keeps contradicting himself!! Argh! He won’t let another entitity veto a national security issue, but he’s going to draw closer to our allies. How can he do both. There’s more about the economy and how it’s failed and how we’re not secure. Then he says our best days are before us and that “I’m an optimist”. Hmm…wonder how that’s going to play with the “rose colored glasses” dig his campaign made about Bush before the debate? “Stronger at home and respected again in the world”. There’s the closing campaign slogan. Bush talks about leadership and our shared experiences: terrorist attacks, recession, war. And he notes how we’re moving forward despite all those things. It’s a clear implication that or good days are before us and that we’re in a better day now than the one we were in yesterday. That’s a strong message."}]}

Sigmon The Media Center as the Hub of Four Blocks"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "An inquiry came recently from Sylvia Hix, a Library Media Specialist at Lakeview Elementary in Nashville, Tennessee.  Sylvia and a teacher in her school were busy writing a grant to support some training in Four Blocks, and she wanted me to share with her how---and if---Ifelt that a media specialist could be helpful and involved in the school's implementation of the Four blocks framework.  Sylvia and Iboth thought that our discussion might be useful to others. Yes, media specialists can be critical to the success of 4-Blocks in a school.  Of course, teachers can be successful in spite of that lack of support from the librarian/media specialist, but those teachers really have to be super-motivated and super-informed.  When the partnership is strong between teachers and the media specialist, implementation can be so much easier and so much more successful. Below are some ways that media specialists can help:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Media specialists can keep teachers updated on good read-aloud printed material for their SSR Block. Using a few minutes during each faculty meeting would be a great way to model read-aloud techniques and to give advice about titles that would be of interest to kids at different grade levels. On some days, librarians can actually do the read-aloud portion of the block for classes that are using the library for SSR Block on a rotating basis.  The kids then select books from throughout the library with the help of the teacher and the librarian.  Learning to pick appropriate books is an important skill for students and is usually acquired with help from one of these knowledgeable adults. Librarians can be instrumental in helping teachers make decisions about books that would be popular and appropriate to include in the students' book baskets during SSR Block.  In some schools that don't have generous classroom libraries, the librarians actually help teachers stock the individual book baskets.  Stocking the baskets is a difficult task as we look for a variety of ranges: readability levels, topics, genres, and authors. Librarians can help with selections that can be used for the grade-level and easier materials during Guided Reading.  Multiple copies of texts are almost always used for Guided Reading Block.  Librarians can make recommendations about appropriate texts and in some cases might even store multiple copies from which teachers can make their selections.  It's of little use for an individual teacher to have a huge collection of multiple texts when these can be stored in the library and made available to more teachers.  The below grade level texts are sometimes difficult for teachers to access. Librarians can furnish appropriate texts for Words Block where teachers are always on the lookout for rhyming texts or those books that allow them to explore the word level of reading. Librarians can encourage teachers to use certain books for their modeling during Writing Block where authors use techniques, styles or offer exemplars of good Standard English that would help students grow in their own writing. The librarian can set aside space for student publications from various classrooms that are publishing during their Writing Block.  Some librarians may want to actually put a bar code on the student publications and find prime display space for them.  This would really motivate students to improve their writing!  Students writing is exponentially better when they know that they have a real audience---and especially when that audience is their peers! The librarian may want to host a monthly (or whatever time period seems reasonable given all the tasks they do!) Authors' Tea for students who have published at certain grade levels or for representatives from each classroom.  This again would keep those kids writing!  Tables might even be set up for autographing. The librarian could be the person who helps the adults in the school establish a reading habit for themselves.  Often, as we encourage students to acquire good reading habits we don't see that we are their best models for lifetime reading.  We may use the time in school to help establish students' reading habits, but we hope and expect that there will be transfer outside of the school.  We may never be able to convince kids of this if we don't see ourselves as readers.  The librarian might be the person who includes adult books (not the X-rated ones---these are books for adults!) in the faculty newsletter.  Or, perhaps the librarian starts a book club for faculty members who want to gather once a week or once a month to discuss a book they all agree to read.  We could simulate Oprah's book clubs where we chat about the book and have snacks or dinner together.  What fun!  And, the students would know about it, too!  They would know that we ARE readers---we practice what we preach! The librarian can serve as the hub for 4-Blocks growth in the school not only by furnishing books as stated above, but also by keeping the momentum going---displaying posters of students' work, displaying teachers' work, posting ideas for teachers to try in their 4-Blocks delivery, inviting teachers and students to review books and write advertisements for them, displaying a Word Wall, etc."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Yes!

He also\n          is the sponsor and the creator of a new subcommittee on the Senate\n          Armed Services Committee called Emerging Threats and Capabilities. He\n          also sponsored a scholarship program to encourage more students to\n          become information security specialists. So he has played a critically\n          important role in a field in which you are deeply engaged. \"Iwill be brief because the buses Iam told will not leave before Ifinish but Iwant them to leave reasonably on time. \"You were addressed Ibelieve earlier this morning, or afternoon, you\n          heard from Congressman Dave McCurdy, Senator Bob Bennett and Mike\n          Vatis about global infrastructure of security. I'd like to take a\n          little bit different tack here today, this afternoon, and talk about a\n          different aspect of national security. \"It seems to me that virtually every cover story that Isee about IT in\n          recent magazines has been about security. The good news is it's\n          helping to raise public awareness and corporate awareness about the\n          issue of protecting secure information. The bad news, Ithink, is that\n          you're basically seeing what Iwould call off Broadway productions\n          when the real show was taking place in Times Square itself. \"The media attention is focused upon teenagers who are defacing\n          websites, launching denial of service attacks or juvenile\n          extortionists who steal and threaten to post credit card numbers.\n          These are serious problems with very large amounts of money attached\n          to them, but the threat to privacy and proprietary information is\n          about to explode in a world that many of you are designing and\n          building and one in which the capabilities are embedded into devices\n          all around us and soon even within us. These devices are\n          interconnected to a network that spans the globe. If John Chambers\n          were here, he would describe this as the virtual global ecosystem. \"Now, hackers and crackers, they are mere nuisances compared to another\n          growing threat that I've tried to focus on and one Iwant to discuss\n          with you today, and that is the convergence of the world's second\n          oldest profession with the latest technology and its implications for\n          the business community. Corporate espionage has always been, or at\n          least it should have been, a concern for the business community,\n          because while the average cost of a hacking attack or denial of\n          service is said to be roughly $150,000 in terms of the costs to a\n          company, according to the FBI the average loss of a corporate\n          espionage incident is much larger. \"There is a survey that was conducted in 1999 by ASIS, the American\n          Society for Industrial Security, and over half of the manufacturers\n          who were surveyed reported being a victim that year with an average\n          loss of $50 million per incident. Nearly half of the companies\n          surveyed were, they described themselves as high tech firms and they\n          reported these incidents, and while they lost only a half a million\n          dollars per incident where the loss could be valued, they were\n          successfully targeted more than 60 times during the course of the\n          year. So you can see this can add up to many tens of millions of\n          dollars. \"Despite the fact that the heavy focus is on Internet hacking as such,\n          the incident for corporate spying is roughly the same. You have\n          roughly the same amount of attacks on the penetration attempts for\n          corporate proprietary information as you do for denial of service\n          attacks. And so others have now indicated that over a third of U.S.\n          companies are now the target of industrial espionage with the numbers\n          that are quadrupling since the beginning of the last decade every\n          year, and there is no end in sight. \"Imention this because in spite of the legislation that's been passed,\n          Ihelped to author an act called the 1996 Economic Espionage Act along\n          with Senator Specter, making it a crime to engage in such activity.\n          But a significant portion of those corporate espionage activities are\n          actually sponsored by foreign governments. \"Ithink it is somewhat of a paradox that state-sponsored espionage has\n          become even greater at the end of the cold war than it was during. In\n          fact, a number of these espionage apparatuses, apparati Iguess it\n          would be called now, were redirected to spy on behalf of the\n          businesses in their country. \"Iam not talking to you now as a former Secretary of Defense but\n          calling upon my experience of a total of 24 years on Capitol Hill and\n          draw upon the statements that Imade at that time. It was nearly a\n          decade ago when Boris Yeltsin gave a very historic speech on the floor\n          of the United States House of Representatives to a joint session of\n          Congress, and you may recall this. He said, 'No more lies.'\n          Ithink because of the thunderous applause that he received people\n          thought he said, 'No more spies.' And yet we know from\n          recent events and recent revelations, that clearly is not the case. \"The point is that we should have known this all along. If anyone got\n          the impression at the end of the cold war that that meant that there\n          is no one left to come in from the cold, then they didn't get that\n          impression from Moscow because after the collapse of the Berlin Wall,\n          the head of the KGB Vladimir Karyoshkov[?], he publicly announced that\n          his agents would be busier than ever with an enhanced focus on\n          industrial espionage. \"The KGB is far from being alone in this regard. Not long after the\n          Director of the KGB made his announcement Pierre Marion[?], the former\n          director of French intelligence directorate, publicly admitted that he\n          directed the intelligence forces of France to secretly collect and\n          pass on to French companies information they were able to secure from\n          their competitors in the United States and elsewhere. \"And our friends in the French intelligence service provide a full\n          range of services. Among those that are most widely publicized are\n          cases in which they stole proprietary technical data from a U.S.\n          computer manufacturer and then provided it to a French competitor. \"Another case in which we had a French national working for a U.S.\n          fiber optics company sold trade secrets to the French intelligence,\n          which then in turn passed it on to the French competitor. And in the\n          case that Monsieur Marion was particularly proud of, the French\n          intelligence acquired the pricing proposal from a U.S. aircraft\n          manufacturer, which enabled its French rival to underbid it in a\n          billion dollar contract. \"In short, the espionage threat is no longer solely focused on state\n          secrets. It's primarily targeted against trade secrets. And the threat\n          comes not from just our adversaries, but ironically enough from our\n          allies. And while the threat to the technology is real, they don't\n          have to steal the technology itself. In fact, it may be more difficult\n          for them to work with technology that's stolen. What they really want\n          is the information on which you price your product, and they want to\n          be able to underbid you and then offer it to their competing firms. \"Now, some of you might be aware that the European Union, or the\n          European Parliament Ishould say, is currently conducting an inquiry\n          as to whether the U.S. intelligence agency is providing information to\n          American businesses. Let me say that the allegation is false. It is\n          unfounded. U.S. intelligence agencies do not, they cannot and they\n          will not steal information from foreign companies to benefit U.S.\n          companies, and there are many practical reasons why this is the case.\n          We cannot do so, but more importantly U.S. officials across a number\n          of administrations have made it clear as a matter of principle that we\n          would never do so. \"Corporate espionage and even corporate espionage conducted by foreign\n          governments, their intelligence services is nothing new. The point Iwant to make today is it is intensifying at ever growing rates, and\n          what is making it even more difficult for us is that we are becoming\n          increasingly more vulnerable because most of the companies that you\n          represent you are adopting information based systems to manage\n          research, design, production, finances, customer relations and as\n          companies have adopted new business models and new technology, they\n          have also created new vulnerabilities. Let me give you just a few\n          examples. \"What is a code word that constantly is invoked if you're trying to\n          streamline, get more efficient, downsize? You outsource. We did a good\n          deal of this in the Pentagon itself, but there has been an increasing\n          accelerative move on the part of businesses to outsource anything\n          that's not regarded as a core competency in activities that were done\n          in-house from the back office functions to logistics to production,\n          and a company will often give its supplier privileged access to\n          facilities and increasingly to its network so they can become an\n          effective member of the team. But the suppliers are also\n          electronically networked in ways that you have never even thought of.\n          They themselves face pressures of outsourcing some of their non-core\n          competencies. And so you have a series of a chain of trust being\n          delegated to relationships upon relationships until you finally have\n          complete strangers who are interconnected to your innermost working\n          databases. \"Outsourcing of software production Ithink it's very clear is growing\n          every year that software production is being outsourced overseas. And\n          we think of the three I's. India, Ireland and Israel are the most\n          obvious examples. But the phenomenon is global. You can hire online a\n          programmer in Pakistan with a Master's degree, three years of program\n          experience for roughly $1,200 a month, and one that has 12 years of\n          experience for about twice that much. \"This creation of the global labor force is a great boon to our\n          industries, and it's also helping develop economic situations around\n          the world. But it also creates unprecedented vulnerabilities. \"Another thing is taking place, consolidation. How many of you in the\n          audience are under pressure to increasingly consolidate, to merge with\n          various companies? Those who survive this consolidation are not really\n          focused on the networking systems of emerging partners. They are not\n          worrying enough about the in-laws that they are marrying up with. And\n          whether you merge or acquire a company, you take on board those\n          external relationships with outsourcing suppliers and agreements that\n          cover that relationship no matter how inadequate. \"As you all know computing capability is being embedded in devices all\n          around us. In copiers, coffee pots, cars, clothing, even in our\n          bodies. These embedded devices are now being interconnected with our\n          offices. They operate our factories. They tie our suppliers and\n          industrial partners, and they reach around the globe. \"Iwant to say this afternoon that promiscuity in the cyber realm is\n          equally dangerous to your health and presents the same risks as\n          promiscuity in the physical realm. Every one of your partners has his\n          own set of partners who in turn have their own partners, and you are\n          effectively sleeping with every single one of them. The result can be\n          a contagion of what Iwould call STD, sensitive technology\n          distribution, for which there may be no cure. Drug companies can rest\n          assured that there is no patent to be infringed upon here. \"Adecade ago, I'll give you some examples, a decade ago there was a\n          good deal of attention focused on a Dallas computer maker that he\n          learned that his pricing information somehow had gotten into the hands\n          of a South Korean rival. That rival had used that information to\n          tailor its own bids and take away the competition. \"So the Dallas company hired a private detective agency. They\n          discovered a coat closet at corporate headquarters had a small box\n          inside that room containing a radio transmitter that was wired to a\n          cable that led to one of the company's fax machines. The bug had been\n          planted by a new employee who had been a mole for the South Korean\n          company. So in order for that Dallas computer company to be penetrated\n          a decade ago, the Korean mole had to gain access to the fax machine,\n          splice in a tap, hide the radio transmitter in the closet. \"Today, it's much easier, and Iwant to cite just one example. Today\n          most printers and faxes and other peripherals that have infrared ports\n          for data exchange and so does your Palm Pilot, or Ihave up here a\n          little demonstrative evidence, a Visor. As Iwalk into your conference\n          room for a meeting, my Visor can communicate with your printer, which\n          may be connected to your network. If Ican beam into your printer, Ican own your network. Oftentimes companies have printers, fax machines\n          and other desktops right in line of sight as people enter the\n          premises. \"So you want to think about this the next time a bicycle courier drops\n          into your office. And Iwant to give you another practical insight as\n          to what can take place. \"When Iwas in the Senate, there was a common scam being run by\n          unscrupulous bicycle couriers who visited virtually every office and\n          they would ask to use the phone to call the dispatcher after they had\n          dropped off their package to your office. Of course, they had set up a\n          1-900 number which they were collecting either a dollar or two on\n          every call that was being made and placed. \"Now, if they can be creative enough to put a system like that together\n          where they can make quite a few dollars, imagine if they carry and\n          come in with a little infrared device that can download information\n          off one of your printers or fax machines. So you have to be careful\n          what is available to them. \"As this chain of connectivity grows exponentially, the number of weak\n          links is going to grow even faster, and no one -- Iwill say no one --\n          is properly prepared to protect themselves in this emerging embedded,\n          networked environment. And so there are quite a few people who are\n          working very hard to exploit your vulnerability. \"As Iwas looking over the material for today's conference, Ialso came\n          across something in Newsweek last week. It was in the Cyberscope, and\n          it had two new items that it called the reader's attention to. One is\n          called Beamie Baby, and it talks about taking your Palm Pilot or your\n          Visor, walking through an airport and they would have a cereal size\n          box which you could download your e-mail or get information off the\n          Internet. Well, if you are beaming up from your Palm Pilot or your\n          Visor or other PDA that you might have information you pull of the\n          Internet, you can also have a situation where they're pulling\n          information out of your Palm Pilot. So if you have any kind of\n          proprietary data which has been downloaded so you can travel\n          conveniently, you'd better take care that that information is fully\n          protected. \"Microsoft, also it says 'Microsoft's latest trick, a phone with a\n          PC built in,' and it has a nice photograph of the PDA and a\n          phone, which is very convenient to have it all in one. One of the\n          problems, of course, is that your phone can be put on remotely.\n          Assuming your phone is turned off and you're in a conference room, you\n          should take care to take the battery out of your phone because your\n          phone can be activated and serve as a receiver and the entire\n          conversation can be picked up remotely. And so this PDA combination\n          phone that's great and is convenient, it also can be a device\n          depending on what you have in it that can be extracted remotely in a\n          matter of nanoseconds. \"Now, there are some business opportunities associated with this kind\n          of espionage. You have lawyers who are more than willing to bring a\n          lawsuit on behalf of shareholders or your partners or the company that\n          you might be merging or acquiring for your breach of fiduciary duty to\n          protect proprietary information. So you must take care. You are\n          charged as a fiduciary with protecting proprietary information and you\n          must personally undertake to make sure that you have all the proper\n          barriers and the kind of protective techniques to protect that\n          information. Otherwise you may find yourself subject to a lawsuit. \"Secondly, there are insurance companies in their personal and\n          commercial and industrial policies that are very careful to exclude\n          any coverage for loss of IT information. They are more than happy to\n          sell you additional policies to cover this sort of information,\n          however. So there is another business opportunity there, but that's\n          not the kind Ithink that you would like to promote. \"So the question is these are the problems as we become more and more\n          connected and wired together we become increasingly vulnerable to\n          people who are pulling that information from our very midst. There is\n          a two-edged sword of technology. You can have firewalls. You must\n          erect firewalls to protect your information, but be careful. The\n          people who may be marketing the firewalls may also have a trap door in\n          the firewall so that they can pull all of the information out either\n          for their companies or for their countries who may be sponsoring the\n          companies who are selling the firewalls. \"There is available exportable encryption public key infrastructure and\n          so forth, but this technology really can't overcome faulty human\n          beings who create these vulnerabilities so we need other things. We\n          need to have effective information security policies, training and\n          regular re-training because the technology is changing so rapidly\n          we've got to constantly update our awareness of what is possible and\n          what is potential. \"We have to have effective early warning systems. The U.S. government\n          does not do offensive warning as such. It will warn companies if they\n          know they are being targeted. So if you are a U.S. company and you are\n          being targeted by another intelligence service to gain information for\n          proprietary information for your competition, they will alert you to\n          this. They do not provide you with any information. So we have to have\n          effective early warning systems, and the private sector should be\n          willing to work more closely with the U.S. government. There is great\n          reluctance on the part of the private sector to establish too much of\n          a close relationship with the U.S. government. Ithink that's a\n          mistake. But there is a lack of trust there that you're number one\n          afraid to report that some of your systems either have been\n          compromised, that you have been the subject of external attempts to\n          penetrate your systems, that this information might somehow be\n          disseminated in ways that would injure your company. But Ibelieve\n          that if you're going to have protection in the future, then we have to\n          find ways of sharing information and setting up a trust relationship\n          with various agencies within various departments in the U.S.\n          government that can help you protect your proprietary information. \"Because you bear liability, because you are held responsible, it is\n          important that you not leave it simply to the hired help. It is\n          important that your probe the security of your partners and your\n          suppliers and people who you hire on a temporary basis. How many of\n          you here have found the situation, Icertainly have found it, that\n          suddenly one of your key secretaries is out and you have a temporary\n          that comes in. Who checks the background of the temporary? How much\n          access does he or she have to your networking systems? You have got to\n          adopt a very aggressive, affirmative duty to check all of this out.\n          Otherwise, you open yourself up to the liability. \"So outsourcing prudence, subject your contract and your temporary\n          employees to the same personnel checks you would your permanent\n          workforce, and be very, very careful and deliberate in deciding what\n          access they have. \"Finally, the public wake-up that needs to take place. Imentioned ASIS\n          before. They surveyed companies who see foreign competitors,\n          especially foreign intelligence services, as a low threat. The FBI\n          reports nearly a quarter of economic espionage involved foreign\n          nations and the threat is emanating from some 23 countries today. \"So this is something. It is serious. It is growing. You should be\n          aware of it. You should focus on it. The goal, of course, is to\n          protect the mission. No system is foolproof. No human is faultless.\n          Perfection is not the objective, but the objective is to protect the\n          corporation's mission. And remember that includes protecting your\n          partners and your customers. \"There is a wonderful quote from T.S. Eliot. He asked the question\n          where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge and where is the\n          knowledge we have lost in information. And Iwould add to that where\n          is the business we have lost in the information that's being stolen."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "\"Thank you very much.\""}]}

Never mind that, no matter what the plan, the Bush Campaign would ridicule any element that it could not coopt. (That led to the recent pecularity, following Kerry's first clear speech on an Iraq plan, in which the unreflective Bush Campaign declared through parallel statements to the media, \"His ideas are the same as ours\" and \"He's advocating 'defeat and retreat'\".) Never mind that no similar demand has been made of the Bush Campaign. I'll give David Ignatius this much - at least he's breaking with the nonsensical pattern of demanding the challenger to outline precisely what he would do in Iraq while failing to make any similar demand of the Bush Campaign. But any person who can assert,"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "The coming offensive in Fallujah could be the bloodiest combat that U.S. forces have faced yet in Iraq. Worse, it could push interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's fragile interim government toward the breaking point. One early warning sign was this week's comment by interim President Ghazi Yawar, a Sunni Muslim, criticizing recent U.S. airstrikes on Fallujah as \"collective punishment.\" It was Yawar's threat to quit the interim government last April that helped halt the previous U.S. offensive in Fallujah."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "has to also know that a strategy for the present situation in Iraq, let alone an exit strategy, could be dramatically changed by the success or failure of such a venture - and that even a military success could result in a profound setback if it inspires the collapse of the Allawi government, broadens the \"resistance\", or prevents elections. Ignatius continues,"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "If you try to put yourself in the boots of a U.S. soldier in Iraq, what you want to know from the candidates is: Can we win this thing, and if not, how can we get out? Unfortunately, the debate didn't really illuminate those essential questions. The most difficult days in Iraq may well lie ahead, but neither candidate has leveled with the country about how severe that test will be, or what fallback plans he has if his assumptions prove overly optimistic."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "The questions are not entirely unfair, but Ignatius again ignores the fact that what might work today might not work tomorrow, let alone next month. The answer to \"can we win this thing\" seemed a bit different when Bush was strutting beneath his \"Mission Accomplished\" banner than it does today - and the colossal mistakes made since that time make it much less likely that we will achieve the results we most desire. Then, \"winning\" was defined as creating a stable nation with a secular, democratic government. Today, \"winning\" seems to be defined as achieving stability, preventing civil war, and creating a government that is not hostile to western interests. Would Ignatius call a plan to achieve that end a plan for victory? Bush, the person in the best position to provide the type of answers Ignatius demands, won't provide them. His answers would be an admission of the failure of his central promises in the \"liberation\" of Iraq, and would also reveal that he has no \"exit strategy\". And his campaign can't simultaneously accuse Kerry of \"defeat and retreat\" while simultaneously proposing Bush's plan for doing precisely what he ridicules. Bush would love for Kerry to paint a strategic picture on Iraq that addresses the present realities. \"See how negative and pessimistic he is. Defeat and retreat. He's setting back our interests in the region.\" Columnists like Ignatius need to place the onus on the Bush Administration to announce its plan - to which the Kerry camp could then be called upon to respond with what it would do differently. And Bush knows that had he clearly enunciated his plan for Iraq and \"exit strategy\", he would have had to update the plan so frequently as to be (in his parlance) the quintessential flip-flopper, or would have had to repeatedly admit failure. Or both. Perhaps, before being allowed to write columns like this, columnists like Ignatius should be required to propose their own plans to achieve victory in Iraq, and their ideas of a viable exit strategy. Perhaps such a demand would be the only thing that would wake them up to the realities of the situation, and why their demands are rather silly.

That is, the speakers will declare something silly like, \"Kerry doesn't excite me\", or \"He was picked because he was considered the most electable\", as if... as if either statement has any significance, or as if parties should pick unelectable candidates. Or \"Bush reminds me of a guy I'd drink a beer with\", or \"Ilike his swagger and confidence - he's like me\" (which is pretty much what a blue collar attendee at a Nascar event said a few months back - as if Bush is anything like him). When you hear something more substantive, such as \"Kerry flip-flops\", and press for details, you're lucky if you get any. In my experience, pressing for details reveals these comments to be inspired not by the candidate, but by news coverage of supposed voter ambivalence and of the other side's attack ads. Iam often left to wonder what these people want in a candidate. Whose idea is it that you should want a candidate you would drink a beer with, or that you shouldn't want a candidate who instead drinks wine and likes fancy food? Or that you should have an (unelectable) candidate who excites you, rather than a staid, intelligent, and competent candidate who seems, well, staid, intelligent, and competent instead of \"exciting\". The media, Isuppose, started to buy into the packaging and selling of a candidate, over the substance and competence of a candidate, after the Nixon-Kennedy debates. So \"Dukakis looks silly in that helmet\"-type nonsense often becomes the media's central focus, as opposed to the candidates' positions on the issues. (The media's distractability was very well highlighted by their response to the \"Swift Boat Liars\" nonsense - and the effort of even the New York Times to blame a candidate for its poor work. Sure, Dukakis didn't have to put on the helmet and get into the tank, but was that really a story?) If you were \"surprised\" by John Kerry's performance at the first Presidential debate - which he is widely regarded as having \"won\" - here's some news for you: If you had been paying attention to the candidate as opposed to the spin, you wouldn't have been surprised. You want a candidate who thinks in simple terms and speaks in pre-packaged sound bites, instead of one who understands the world's complexities and whose comments reflect thought and abstraction? Perhaps, then, you should do us a favor and limit yourself to voting for the county dog catcher. If you want more from a candidate, stop regurgitating the media's latest spin, and start listening to what the candidates are actually saying.

Maybe it has something to do with a small child who won't behave? Actually, it's lingo that some lawyers use to describe malpractice cases involving birth injuries. Realizing that most professions at times use expressions that are a bit unseemly, Ican't get used to that particular example. There are cases of obstetric malpractice which are truly appalling. But, as everybody knows, not all birth injuries are the fault of the doctor. And there is validity to complaints about lawsuits being filed over alleged birth injuries when causation can't be made more certain than a coin toss. Very few lawyers engage in this type of litigation - on the one hand, fortunately, there aren't that many cases to be litigated in any given state; on the other hand, it is far too costly a gamble for those who can't afford to specialize in this type of litigation. Very few attorneys can risk $100,000.00 or more in up-front costs on a coin toss. And, although doctors may argue otherwise, very few attorneys would want to engage in this type of practice. The way it works is this: there's a birth case, where the baby has a serious injury that might be a birth injury, or it might be a congenital disorder for which the doctor has no fault. The medical evidence is equivocal - so the defense hires \"experts\" who testify that it was congenital or was an unavoidable consequence of birth, and the plaintiff hires \"experts\" who argue that the injury was caused by medical malpractice. The same experts often make a very handsome living from their testimony alone, be it for the malpractice insurance carrier or the plaintiff. The jury is then asked to pick a side  by a \"preponderance of the evidence\" - which is why Ireferenced the coin toss. Whether one side persuades the jury that the plaintiff only proved a 49% likelihood of malpractice or a 51% likelihood of malpractice may turn more on external factors - such as whether the defendant doctor seemed arrogant when he testified, or whether the plaintiff came across as a greedy opportunist - than on the evidence. If the lawyer wins one case out of two, the strategy is a big-time moneymaker. There's another side to this type of litigation. It is this paradigm which is used as the rationale for sweeping \"tort reform\" measures which are designed not to make the jury's fact-finding more accurate, or to prevent the filing of \"frivolous suits\", but which are aimed directly at the most seriously injured victims of malpractice. The cry is that \" obstetricians and neurologists pay too much for malpractice insurance \", with the illogic that this necessarily means that all doctors should thus receive broad protections from liability for their mistakes - no matter how egregious the physician's conduct, and no matter how severe the patient's injury. I'm all for hearing proposals from physicians on how to make the birth injury situation more fair. (Or, for that matter, the somewhat similar situation for neurosurgeons, who may end up being sued as the result of a horrific maloccurrence - a fancy word for a 'bad outcome' - from a high risk surgery, even in the absence of malpractice.) But when it comes to making the system better, doctors and their lobbyists are almost universally silent. They instead want to arbitrarily limit the damages received by the most seriously injured victims of malpractice, in the most meritorious of cases. That's at least as immoral as going to court on a coin toss over a \"bad baby\" case.

{"file_number": "181", "plaintext": [{"tag": "div", "text": "java.net"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Behind The Scenes of Project Looking Glass"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "by Will Iverson 07/06/2004"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Irecently had the opportunity to sit down with Hideya Kawahara, lead developer for 3D Project Looking Glass , Sun's 3D desktop technology open source project on java.net . Before meeting with Hideya, Imust confess that Ihad been operating under the mistaken assumption that Project Looking Glass was intended as a replacement window manager for Linux, a 3D novelty of no more consequence than any of a long list of failed attempts at reinventing the traditional, 2D desktop in a new, 3D world. Instead, what Ifound was considerably more interesting. In effect, Project Looking Glass is a rational approach toward using the latest 3D hardware advances to provide a state-of-the-art desktop environment, familiar yet far more engaging for a traditional 2D desktop user. The demonstration Hideya gave me of the system was quite dynamic. Windows spin and zoom, stack, become translucent, flip to reveal additional information on the back, and more. Asample 3D audio CD selector can be dragged around, and the elements move in a manner that conveys an appealing weight and physicality. The demonstration basically fell into two areas, a theoretical next generation window manager and examples of user interface elements in a 3D environment. By providing integration with the Xwindowing system, the demonstration shows existing 2D applications spinning and flying about, with transparency and video running seamlessly as the windows move. By open sourcing the environment, Hideya hopes that as the platform matures not only will existing 2D applications spin and fly, but that third party developers will be able to use Project Looking Glass to build rich, interactive 3D applications with a whole new suite of interactions. One additional revelation: Project Looking Glass is actually built using Java 3D as a key foundation technology, and the primary programmatic interface for 3D-aware applications in this release is Java technology. So, conceptually, a write-once-run-anywhere application could be built using Project Looking Glass, providing desktop applications with rich 3D interactivity. With all of this in mind, Hideya spoke about the past, present and future of Project Looking Glass. What was the motivation behind Project Looking Glass? We were interested in breaking boundaries. The boundaries fall into two areas: a 2D vision of a desktop, defined twenty years ago on much more limited hardware, and the relative stagnation of desktop innovation because of, in my humble opinion, a sort of closed fashion of evolution. Recently, there has been tremendous innovation in the 3D capabilities of the personal computer, driven by innovation in games. The idea is not to throw away the existing research in user interfaces developed for the 2D world, but instead to build on it. 3D is a very challenging problem — there have been several attempts at trying to solve this over the years. In order to get innovation started in this area, we are open sourcing the research we have done so the broadest possible group of people can work with it. We believe that the open development model works great for the exploration of this new 3D frontier - with vast possibilities. How is this different from previous attempts at building a 3D interface? We aren't moving the desktop into a 3D world per se, we are trying to enhance the view of a 2D world by adding 3D functionality where it makes sense. For a user of a traditional 2D environment, at first blush this will simply look like a much, much nicer extension of their existing environment. For example, a 3D application might leverage the \"back\" of a window, allowing a user to flip a window over to take notes. As a more complex example, consider a modal dialog. As an example, our prototype window manager flips a window over to display a modal dialog on the \"back\" of the window that owns the dialog. Doesn't that obscure the window contents? Well, yes, but that's part of the point of the whole exercise: considering new, innovative user interface elements that are possible based on 3D technology. One of the more realistic concepts is the way our demonstration window manager slides windows over at an angle. You can rotate a window to put it in the background, so you can still see the window contents in a useful way. At a more basic level, you can make some much more dynamic and interesting desktop backgrounds. That's where things get blurry for some people trying to sort out where the Project Looking Glass platform ends and a real window manager begins. Are you looking at integration with the popular windows managers, such as GNOME and KDE? The issues with regard to GNOME/KDE and the profusion of desktop environments are really orthogonal to Project Looking Glass. For example, Mac OS Xdifferentiates between various technology layers — for example, BSD, Aqua, Cocoa, all are different layers in the overall environment. Similarly, Linux needs to evolve into a more complex environment with different layers. To keep Linux competitive, we need to think about how to move forward into the next generation. The goal here is not to introduce a new desktop model, but to provide the underpinnings for the next generation. By integrating 3D into the window manager, it's an easy way for existing 2D applications to obtain 3D functionality, in a sense, \"for free.\" We want to be sure that we are aligned with the open source world. We pay attention to the different issues that are going on, and we are working with X.org to develop the proper integration and extensions. We view the current proof-of-concept's primitive windowing system as a demonstration. For example, we would like to see GNOME move into a world that is more 3D in nature. What about shipping an app with Project Looking Glass platform bundled in? For example, one of the demos is a mockup of a 3D audio CD player. Could a developer build an application on top of Project Looking Glass platform and ship it for multiple platforms? It is our vision to allow this sort of usage. We haven't built demos with this in mind, but Idon't see anything to prevent this. We do hope that many developers create sample 3D applications that run on the Project Looking Glass platform and have a place in our open source community for those applications on http://lg3d-demo-apps.dev.java.net Why would Iuse Project Looking Glass instead of OpenGL? Project Looking Glass is actually built on top of Java 3D, which in turn supports OpenGL. One way to think about Project Looking Glass is as a 3D application framework focused on building 3D desktop applications and user interfaces. Project Looking Glass defines a new suite of events and integration. For example, a traditional application might use 3D just as one portion of the functionality, such as depicting the information on a chart in a spreadsheet. Project Looking Glass defines a lot more semantics for how the 3D scene graph is developed and interactions between the objects onscreen. One way to think about this — in any 3D application, a key part of the functionality is the manner in which the 3D objects interact. In a typical 3D game, the objects represent elements that run around and do things, such as opening doors and shooting at each other. One of big goals of Project Looking Glass is to define an environment in which the events and object information are suited to the operation of a desktop environment. Can you explain a bit more about the software that is being made available? We have been working for several months on cleaning the software up, providing basic features and functionality key to 3D window management. Akey focus was looking at the existing 2D desktop apps, ensuring minimal compatibility and performance problems. The next step is to look what else we can do to foster real world 3D interactivity. We decided to open source this at a very early stage to ensure that we got good feedback from the community. The original proof-of-concept blurred the Xclient/server model more that we would like. Also, it didn't define any reasonable APIs. Our goal for this release was to refine the architecture and reimplement everything from scratch in order to ensure that the client/server model is preserved. We are also defining clear APIs for 3D apps and desktop development. We leveraged the Java 3D API for this. We want to ensure client isolation remains solid and the platform provides well abstracted API. Also, we wanted to ensure that the platform is still high performance while at the same time achieving the client isolation. So, we are looking at low level details involved in this. We would like to make sure that moving the client to 3D would still a solid performer, and to ensure that the isolation between the 3D scenegraph server and the client applications is very high, so that the server can be made as stable as possible. Linux only? Linux only right now, Solaris operating environment shortly. Much of the current environment is actually rendered using Java technology. There is no legacy application support for Windows, but you can run the Project Looking Glass environment on Windows, just as you can run any Java 3D application. We don't want to exclude Windows developers. The compatibility stuff with X, obviously, doesn't work for existing Windows applications. So, if you want to build a 3D application on top of the Project Looking Glass platform, you could still get a write-once, run-anywhere 3D application that also exhibits more sophisticated. The current version of Project Looking Glass relies on JDK 1.5. We are waiting for JDK 1.5 support on Mac OS Xbefore we can release there. How does this break down for cross-platform application developers? We hope a normal application developer can build an application that respects this 3D environment. In conjunction with the Java desktop integration APIs, this could allow a developer to build a 3D app that can integrate with the other 3D apps, regardless of platform. So, let's say a user has a 3D app that they want to run on Linux, with GNOME support. All of the environment will respect the 3D aspects. That same app eventually should be able to run on Windows, where it will interact properly with the other 3D applications. For example, a 3D version of a notepad and the 3D CD player should be able to have interesting, dynamic 3D interactions regardless of the host platform. Video card support? We expect this to run on 32MB VRAM video cards and above. We leverage the GPU to help push the performance down into lower layers, keeping the computational hit off the main CPU. Geforce2 and above. In particular, texture support is very important, as the rendering of traditional 2D applications involves that sort of surface. Obviously, support for 2D applications are simpler than what most games require. But we also want to set a baseline for 3D graphics support. For example, many laptops have an integrated video, and we want to support those as well as we can. My PC laptop (a Dell Inspiron) has a 32MB RADEON Mobility 7500. Will that work? A: It should — that's the same card that's in my development laptop. Tell me a bit more about how an application developer can work with Project Looking Glass. Are there Java bindings? This is Java 3D-based. We used the Java 3D scene graph model to help manage the relationship between objects. The current version, Java 3D 1.3.1, is the product of several years of investment. It is a very high performance, solid, 3D rendering engine for Java technology. So, the 3D demos and even the example desktop itself are actually written in Java. Right now, if you wanted to create a first class, fully 3D app using Project Looking Glass, you would actually write that in Java. We hope to have bindings for C/C++ developers in the future — obviously. So, Project Looking Glass is actually a very Java-centric technology. We looked at several different environments, but obviously Java is a very productive language. For us to test out the different ideas, we wanted to be able to work very quickly. If we hadn't used Java technology, Project Looking Glass probably wouldn't exist. To the extent that Project Looking Glass is an exploration of 3D environments, Java technology is very key. So, the current environment actually provides Java interfaces, not C/C++ bindings? How do you expect C/C++ developers to work with Project Looking Glass? To be able to support traditional 2D applications, such as OpenOffice, we talked to their engineers and are brainstorming how to approach this. Obviously, we are very interested in supporting native applications. We aren't just paying lip service to this — it is very important to Sun to be able to do this. We attended the X Developers conference in April. It was a great place to meet the Xserver, GNOME, and KDE developers. We got a lot of great feedback, how they would like to see the C++ bindings develop. The slides are posted at the Looking Glass site (pdf). Iwould highly recommend looking them over, especially if you are an Xdeveloper. Inoticed that you are running the demo on the Sun Java Desktop System. Project Looking Glass is very Java technology centric — is this a step toward deeper support for Java at the desktop environment level? Yes, exactly. Although we are in an Advanced Software Development group, we also work very closely with the Sun Java Desktop System group. We hope to add more Java interfaces where it makes sense and adds value. For example, we are looking at how this 3D interactivity can best be extended to the semantics of drag-and-drop in a future desktop environment. For a typical Java developer, classic desktop application development is done with Swing. Any thoughts there, perhaps adding a 3D-enabled look and feel implementation? Yes, that gives a nice integration story for Swing developers. We can add 3D effects, perhaps as a Swing look-and-feel, for a 3D environment. We aren't there yet, but we are looking at it. This is an extremely interesting and exciting area to explore, we think. Swing developers have several tools available. What about tools for building a 3D application? It turns out that tools are very challenging for moving to a 3D world. We are interested in some sort of 3D modeling tool. If you are building a 3D application, you need some sort of system for building the interface elements. For example, the 3D audio CD player demonstrates what a challenge it is for a designer to mock up and prototype this kind of rich desktop application. In the 3D game world, you have tools like Maya. It would be nice to provide a way to incorporate such 3D designer's tool into a tool chain to develop 3D apps and desktop. Also, it would be great to have something on the level of Sun Java Creator or Visual Basic for creating 3D applications, lowering the bar for developers getting started. Consider motion and animation effects — again the 3D CD player serves as an excellent example. For a designer to build a prototype of this kind of interactivity is quite a challenge. That's one of the problems for even the latest generation of 2D environments — for example, even Windows XP doesn't do zooming rectangles when you open a window or folder — something the original Mac OS had back in 1984. You open a window or dialog on Windows XP, and it just pops to the front, with no connection to where that window or dialog came from. That's going to be a big challenge and opportunity — building tools for creating 3D user desktop interfaces. What is the goal for the open source license? We are still discussing this — by the time this article is published, we hope to have those details ironed out. Our current thinking is to release the binaries under a free, business-friendly license, and the source under the GPL or something similar. So, anyone can redistribute released binaries freely.

Here is what Alison Ward of the Star Telegraph has to say about it: For at least three decades, the controversial term has been used to describe the ribbed tank top made famous by violent movie stereotypes and the Fox show Cops . Men who beat their wives, the thinking goes, like to spend their spare time drinking beer in thin white undershirts. The shirt has traveled far beyond its blue-collar roots; celebs have made it sexy. Paris Hilton wears hers with itty-bitty skirts. It's hard to spot Eminem or Kevin Federline (Britney Spears' husband) without one. \"Most nights Iend up wearing a wife-beater T-shirt and boxers,\" Jessica Alba told the leering men's mag Maxim. Newspapers have been claiming since 2003 that \"wife-beater's\" inclusion in the OED is imminent. But in its February issue, GQ -- a magazine that oughta know its men's fashion terms -- swears the word will be added next month in the OED's quarterly online update. Jesse Sheidlower, the OED's North American editor at large, confirms this. Well, sort of. \"It's very likely that this is going to appear,\" he says. Sheidlower says the dictionary accepts about 250 new words per quarter. The third printed edition of the mammoth OED won't be published for several more years, but the online version -- available by subscription -- serves as an official, ever-expanding substitute in the meantime. So what makes \"wife-beater\" a contender? \"If something is really common and relatively widespread, it's likely to go in,\" Sheidlower says.

Unfortunately, that's not saying much. Even if it were\nwritten in a first-tier IF language, APTM would have some problems to\novercome, but as it is, it's hopelessly lumbered by the terrible,\nterrible ADRIFT parser. We're talking about a mystery game here,\nreminiscent of Suspect -- you play a guest at a party where a murder is\ndiscovered, and you must extricate yourself from suspicion. Amystery\ngame, okay? You might think that, in a mystery game, you'd be able to\nSEARCH things. Not this one -- it doesn't recognize SEARCH, LOOK IN, or\nLOOK THROUGH. Worse, with the latter two it parses them as LOOK rather\nthan just admitting that it doesn't recognize them. Same with LOOK UNDER\nand LOOK BEHIND. Hint: ignoring prepositions doesn't make them go away,\nit just makes your response more likely to be wrong. Perhaps, in a\nmystery game, you might want to SHOW things to NPCs. You can't here.\nEven if you hold a completely damning piece of evidence and want to show\nit to the person whom it damns, all you get from the ADRIFT parser is \"Idon't understand what you want me to do with the letter.\" Maybe, in a\nmystery game, you might even want to TELL someone about something. In\nthis game, you can't. All these very basic verbs, absolutely standard\nwith any first-tier system, are unavailable in ADRIFT, and their absence\nabsolutely slaughters this game. In fact, from a very early stage,\nwhenever Iencountered one of the game's many containers, Igot in the\nhabit of trying to GET ALL FROM it, because that was the only reliable\nway Icould get the game to tell me whether there was anything inside.\nNeedless to say, Iwasn't exactly feeling immersed in the story while\ndoing so."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "As Isaid above, even if all these problems were resolved, APTM still\nwouldn't be a great game. Part of the reason for this is the fact that\nthe game seems to operate on its own inscrutable logic rather than any\nsort of recognizable sense of cause-and-effect. For instance, there's a\nportion of the game where access to a useful item is being controlled by\none of the NPCs. The only way to persuade this NPC to let you have the\nobject is to perform a long series of apparently arbitrary tasks, and\nthe NPC doesn't really indicate that it wants these tasks performed. The\nonly way Ifound out was via the walkthrough, and I'd be surprised if\nanybody figured it out any other way. Of course, by that time Iwas\ngoing straight from the walkthrough anyway, because in my initial\nplaythrough of the game, Inever found that NPC at all -- it seems she\nonly appears after a particular item has been discovered, even though\nthat item is more or less unrelated to her absence. Oh, and that item is\nonly accessible by using an object whose primary logical use is\nunimplemented in the game. For the sake of spoilers, Iwon't name what\nthat object is, but just for example, if you found a knife, and the game\ndidn't understand the word CUT, you might think that knife was a red\nherring (and that the game was lazily implemented). Wouldn't you be\nsurprised to find out from the walkthrough that even though CUT isn't\nimplemented, you still need the knife to, oh Idon't know, scrape the\nmud off a stone tablet or something? Something analogous occurs in this\ngame. See what Imean about inscrutable logic? In addition to logic\nproblems, there are certain implementation errors as well. For example,\nmost of the game consists of a flashback, but typing X ME while still in\nthe frame story depicts the PC as if the flashback was already\nhappening. So after all this, what makes APTM the best ADRIFT game I've ever\nplayed? Well, for one thing, despite the occasional glitch, it does have\na decent depth of implementation. Most first-level nouns are described,\nand the setting is rather richly detailed. Ispent an inordinate number\nof hours with Suspect when Iwas younger, and at times this game brought\nback pleasant memories of that experience. The writing gets its job done\nwith a minimum of errors, and the NPCs are coded to handle a reasonable\nnumber of inquiries. In fact, a couple of times during the game Iasked\nan NPC about a somewhat extraneous topic, and was happily surprised to\ndiscover that the response had been implemented. Another point in favor\nof the NPCs is that they will sometimes react sensibly to strange\nactions on the player's part; for instance, walking into the teenage\ndaughter's bedroom while she's making out with the neighbor elicits\nangry responses from both of them, escalating in intensity the longer\nthe PC hangs around. Snooping around the objects in the house, though\nit's necessary, also provokes suspicion from some of the NPCs. Then\nagain, nobody gives you a second glance when you walk through the house\ncarrying an 8-foot ladder, so this realistic implementation is really\nrather patchy. Overall, APTM would be a seaworthy craft, but between the\nlogic holes in its hull and the tsunamis of ADRIFT inadequacy, it sinks\ndismally fast.

Somehow, this seems\nappropriate, because the experience of playing the game was quite\nreminiscent of a recurring dream of mine: the one where Ifind myself in\na play, but Idon't know my character or any of my lines. The other\nactors look at me expectantly, waiting for me to say the words that will\nadvance the plot, and all Ican do is madly improvise in a futile\nattempt to hit on the right topic. Eric's Gift is one of those games\nthat runs on triggers -- examining a particular thing, or asking about a\nparticular subject, or performing some other action triggers a\nnon-interactive cutscene, which changes the PC's location and moves the\nplot along. When games like this work, they give the feeling of a story\nadvancing smoothly, right in sync with the player's actions. When one\nbreaks down, though, it's hell -- players flounder about looking for the\nright action as the plot's momentum evaporates, along with the fun of\nthe game. Rather than guess-the-verb or guess-the-noun, the whole thing\nbecomes a game of guess-the-trigger, which is worse than either one,\nsince it encompasses both verbs and nouns, but you can never be sure\nwhich you're trying to guess at any given moment. That's just what\nhappened to me in Eric's Gift. Iwas in a conversation scene where,\nunbeknownst to me, Ineeded to examine a sub-object of an object (that\nis to say, a second-level noun) in order to trigger the next scene.\nThinking I'd examined everything, and having tried to leave, or do\nvarious other more or less appropriate actions, Ikept fishing for new\nthings to ask about, feeling like one of those characters in Sartre's No\nExit , doomed to spend all eternity trapped with the same annoying\nperson."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "In a situation like this, it really helps a lot if the game is\nthoroughly implemented, and in part, Eric's Gift accomplishes this. All\navailable scenery objects are described, and a few off-the-beaten-path\nconversation topics are implemented, too. However, as time wore on and Ikept not guessing the trigger, the NPC began to feel more and more\nthreadbare, always failing to respond to my increasingly desperate topic\nchoices. Perhaps part of my problem was that Iwas a bit distracted by\nthe game's insistent use of the same metaphor over and over and OVER\nagain. Saying that a woman has a \"light in her eyes\" is already a bit of\na clich, but quite tolerable if said once, maybe even twice. This game\nhits it so often that it becomes comical. My breaking point was when Iencountered this description: \"Her eyes shine with a light of their own,\nwith an intensity that almost blinds you.\" Mind you, there had already\nbeen many repetitions of the \"light in the eyes\" theme, but this one was\nway, way over the top. How could the light in someone's eyes, which Itake to mean an animated, vivacious expression, almost blind me? Icouldn't help but picture the NPC with high-beam headlights for eyes,\nthe PC shielding his face from the glare. The lesson here is that any\ngiven metaphor is best used sparingly -- the more often we see it, the\nless effective it becomes. My other issue with Eric's Gift is that it is pointlessly science-fictional.\nWhat Imean by that is that although the story is set in the\nfuture, it gains virtually nothing thereby. Afew details are changed\nhere and there -- people drink \"synthcaf\" instead of coffee, the TV is\ncalled a \"tri-di\", and so forth -- but otherwise the story might just as\nwell be set in 2002. Not one significant point of plot or character\nderives from the futuristic setting, and consequently that setting is\nlittle more than a distraction. Adding a science-fictional sheen to an\notherwise mundane story doesn't somehow make that story cooler. Quite\nthe contrary, in fact -- it drains the story of mainstream appeal while\ngaining nothing in sf credibility. Oh, and one more thing: there are\nserious logical holes in the plot, especially in the defining element of\nthe plot. Although its writing and coding was competent, the logical\nflaws, awkward emotion, and frustrating design make Eric's Gift one that\nIwon't be keeping.

Of course, it's not the first game to tread\nthis ground -- Photopia and Rameses have famously drawn from the same\nwell -- but it's the first one I've seen that devotes itself so purely\nto the concept, free of any particular narrative or character. However,\nbecause of the way it's structured, it's rather difficult to talk about\nwithout giving too much away.

It's quite\nlegitimate to instruct a player about how to behave in character when a\ncharacter is specified, and in a game this skillfully done, Iwouldn't\nbe at all surprised if the additional level of constraint was quite\nintentional. The idea intrigues me, though. How much of what we call\nconstraints in our lives are simply produced by our own desires, more or\nless independent of our circumstances? When we feel held down, held\nback, would the feeling disappear if we decided that we no longer wanted\nwhatever lay on the other side of the barrier? For that matter, can a\nconstraint even exist without a corresponding desire to define it as\nsuch? In this game, the question is moot -- there's no way of changing\nthe characters' desires -- but Ireally like it that the experience of\nplaying made me think about such a philosophical issue in my own life. It helps a lot that Constraints is quite exquisitely implemented. It's\nclear that this game has been tested thoroughly -- not only did Ifind\nno bugs, but several times throughout the game, Ihad the exciting\nexperience of trying a fairly unusual action, and seeing that the game\nanticipated it and handled it expertly. The game uses the z-machine's\ncolor capabilities quite nicely (thereby giving me another reason to be\nthankful to David Kinder for the new WinFrotz 2002 interpreter), and in\nanother section commits an impressive (though not quite unprecedented)\nz-machine abuse.

{"file_number": "185", "plaintext": [{"tag": "p", "text": "F O Y L E F R I E N D S C H O O L S U R V E Y THE COMING OUT PROCESS Identifying oneself as\nlesbian or gay and disclosing this to other people is often\nreferred to as 'Coming Out'. There are three main issues\nassociated with coming out which schools need to be aware of: 'Coming out' is a necessary and ultimately positive experience\nfor most young people who grow up lesbian or gay. It can\ntake place in the years between starting and leaving secondary\nschool. In this period, coming to terms with confusion about\nidentity can affect a young person's social relationships, school\nwork and self-esteem both negatively and positively. Many young lesbian and gay people experience critical times when\nthey have to decide who to tell about their sexuality. In\nmaking this disclosure they are often fearful of negative\nreactions, rejection and causing upset and distress to the person\nthey are telling. Sometimes a young person may try 'coming\nout' to a supportive teacher or a school friend as a precursor to\ntalking to parents in order to rehearse their own part and to\njudge reactions. Receiving a negative reaction can be very\ndistressing. Support and guarantees of safety are valuable to young people\n'coming out'. The availability of secure and confidential\ngroups or contacts can be instrumental in reducing anxiety which\nis only magnified by feelings of isolation. The presence of\nrole models in the shape of adults who 'come out' and those who\noffer non-judgmental support and help young people access these\ngroups can be important. Positive treatment by, and contact\nwith, role models can also encourage them to feel confident about\ntheir future. There\nare several theories about the elements of the 'coming out'\nprocess. Each has its own emphasis but all of them regard\n'coming out' as a series of stages. These stages do not\nnecessarily last the same length of time and there is no one age\nwhen the whole process begins and ends. These stages can be\ndescribed as follows: Stage 1\n- Sensitisation G9 said \"Iwas probably always a loner anyway, afraid to let anyone\n‘in’, so Iwas a bit of an oddity among my\ncontemporaries anyway.\" Andrew\nsaid \"Only now do Irealise the level of\nharassment, bullying and mental torture that Iendured while at\nschool. Iwas never like all the other boys, always\nexcluded from all the social activities that the majority\nenjoyed. For years Ipondered as to why this was. Why was Ibeing treated differently and castigated by others to such a\nlonely life?\" In this stage a person\ngenerally begins to feel 'different' to other people of the same\nsex. Sometimes they recognise that they are not very\ninterested in people of the opposite sex but more often they feel\nthey are not really interested in things which are supposed to be\nappropriate for their sex. Most people report just feeling\nunusual when they compare themselves to other people of their\nsex. Commonly this happens before or in early adolescence\nwhen friendships and relationships between the sexes begin to\nchange. Roughly\nhalf the LGB men and women surveyed felt 'different' by the age\nof 11. Stage 2\n- Confusion about identity G28 said \"Itried not to think about it as Ifelt\ndisgusted and repulsed if Idared think of fellow class-mates in\na sexual way. Ishuddered at the thought of them\ndiscovering how Ifelt and thought so Inever really thought of\nbeing a gay person at school due to the fact that Ipretended to\nbe 'straight' . Therefore, being gay at school is a life of\npretence, lies and denial. Living in fear of being\ndiscovered due to the ensuing consequences.\" There\nare usually four elements which contribute to confusion about\nidentity: Feeling that perceptions of the self are altering; Feeling and experiencing heterosexual and homosexual sexual\narousal; Sensing the stigma surrounding homosexuality; Lacking knowledge about homosexuality. Research indicates that most\nyoung gay men first decide they are probably gay between the ages\nof 12 and 17, and most young lesbian women first decide they are\nprobably lesbian between the ages of 16 and 20. At this time they\nhave to deal with feeling that they have changed as have their\nrelationships with other people around them. Some also have\nto combat the potentially powerful feelings of self-recrimination\nand disgust that come from describing themselves as homosexual. There are various strategies for coping with this emotional\nupheaval. Some young people who think\nthey are lesbian or gay will try to deny it to themselves and\neven seek help to eradicate their feelings. Others will try\nand avoid thoughts and feelings which remind them that they have\nhomosexual inclinations. In these situations young people\ncan avoid getting any information about sexuality in order to\navoid confirming their suspicions about their orientation. Some young people have great\ndifficulty in managing their relationships with peers and family. They may avoid situations in which they may encounter\nopportunities for heterosexual pairing so that they are not\nforced to deal with their lack of sexual interest in members of\nthe opposite sex or have it exposed. They may,\nalternatively, persevere with heterosexual relationships to try\nand 'convert' themselves and/or conceal their homosexuality from\nothers. In some extreme cases young people may try to avoid\nconfronting their feelings by expressing strong homophobia or\nturning to drink and drugs in order to find temporary relief from\nthem. Finally, some young people fall\nback on a strategy of redefining their feelings and behaviour in\nsuch a way as to convince themselves that it is not really\nhomosexual. For example, they may describe their\nexperiences as a 'phase' or a 'one-off' or they may put them down\nto extreme emotional or physical circumstances such as the\nbreak-up of a relationship or drunkenness at a party. In this\nstage feelings are becoming more concrete. Young people may\nwell have partners of both sexes and may well find their moods\nand feelings shifting as they feel more or less certain about\ntheir identity. This period often lasts throughout\nadolescence. It is important to note that\n50% of gay and bisexual boys surveyed knew they were gay by 11\nand of lesbian and bisexual girls by 12. By 13, 80% of\nlesbian and bisexual girls are aware that they are gay and by 15,\n80% of gay and bisexual boys are aware that they are gay. Most\nchildren who later self-identify as gay/bisexual are well aware that they are gay by NI school year 11 (14/15) Many\nare aware they are gay in NI school year 8 (11/12)! By\nsixth form practically all gay people know they are gay Stage 3 - Assuming a lesbian or gay\nidentity L10 said \"Inever felt so bad about not finding\nmen attractive in the true sense of the word and it helped me\nunderstand why Ifelt like Idid for women so it was no longer\nun-natural.\" G26 said \"Iwas happy to like other boys and\nsensed that the one boy Ifancied was gay as Icould feel that he\nwas interested in me by way of glances and once standing up for\nme when Iwas picked on.\" Clearly,\nliving with confusion about identity is emotionally exhausting\nand potentially destructive. For some young people this\nperiod is followed quite quickly by a stage in which they come to\naccept their lesbian or gay identity and are able to express it\nin a positive way. For both young men and women growing up\nmixing with other young gay people - in social settings or\nthrough support groups - can help them feel able accept to who\nthey are. For some young people, particularly in larger\ntowns and cities, lesbian and gay youth support groups provide a\nsafe environment for 'coming out'. Elsewhere local and\nnational lesbian and gay telephone helplines provide a safe space\nand listening ear for young people who want support."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Figure 5 The time delay between boys\n        realising that they are gay and them telling someone that\n        they are gay"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Most\nboys live with the 'secret' that they are gay for about three\nyears in the middle of their school lives. 90%\nof girls and 93.4% boys had not told their parents they were gay by the time they were doing\ntheir GCSE or Junior Certs (16) Stage 4\n- Commitment < G28 said \" It made me stronger to face future\nprejudice. It made me more determined to stand up for\nmyself and not let any mindless, ignorant superfluous caveman\nprevent me from being what and who Iwas destined to be. For\nthat, Ican be a better person, proud of myself and my\nkind.\" The next stage in the process\nof 'coming out' involves becoming being lesbian or gay openly and\nrecognising that it is a central aspect of, 'who Iam', and, 'how\nIwant to live my life'. Young people begin to feel that\nhomosexuality is a valid way of life and develop a sense of\ncontentment with being lesbian or gay. They often have the\nexperience of falling in love at this time and, perhaps as a\nresult, feel more confident, fulfilled and able to combat the\nsocial stigma that they may suffer. At this time some young lesbian\nand gay people begin to feel proud of their sexuality. The\nexpression of this pride in being lesbian or gay is a powerful\nforce in challenging the stigma attached to homosexuality by\npeople with prejudiced attitudes and provides positive role\nmodels to others less sure about 'coming out'. Stage 5\n- Synthesis No respondents wrote anything that\nwould illustrate synthesis, The person's sexuality becomes\na natural part of their life and ceases to impinge on their\nconsciousness.

{"file_number": "186", "plaintext": [{"tag": "p", "text": "Are You A Representative of USC's Athletics Interest? You are a representative of USC's athletics interests (commonly known as a \"booster\") if you have made a donation to the USC Athletic Department, are or have been a member of a booster organization associated with USC Athletics, or you have been involved in any way with promoting USC's athletic programs. Once an individual is identified as an Athletics Representative, the person retains that identity forever! Who Is A Prospect? Aprospect is a student in the ninth grade and above, including students in prep schools, junior colleges, and individuals who have officially withdrawn from four-year schools. In addition, a student who has not yet started ninth grade may become a prospect if USC or a booster provides the student, or the student's relatives or friends, with financial assistance or benefits not generally provided to other students. What Is Recruiting? Recruiting is any solicitation of a prospect or the prospect's parent/legal guardian by a University staff member for the purpose of securing the prospect's enrollment at USC and/or participation in USC's intercollegiate athletics program. Recruiting activities include correspondence, e-mail, faxes, telephone conversations and in-person contacts (both on and off campus). Who May Recruit? Only coaches and Athletic Department staff may be involved in the recruiting process. The NCAA rules specifically prohibit boosters from engaging in recruiting activities. You may not have any contact (i.e., in-person encounter, telephone call, correspondence) with a prospect or the prospect's family, on or off campus. If a prospect approaches you regarding USC, explain that NCAA rules prevent you from discussing USC with prospects. This prohibition also applies to prospects making official visits to USC. You may not contact a prospect's coach, principal or counselor for the purpose of evaluating a prospect's athletic ability or academic record. You may not talk to a student-athlete at another institution for the purpose of encouraging him or her to transfer to USC. What May Boosters Do? You may continue to have contact with an established family friend or neighbor who is a prospect.  However, such contact may not be for recruiting purposes and may not be initiated by a USC coaching staff member. You may bring outstanding prospects to the attention of the USC coaching staff by sending them newspaper clippings or other information about prospects. However, you may not be involved in the actual evaluation of talent. All evaluations and contacts are the sole responsibility of the USC coaching staff. You may offer assistance to members of USC's coaching staff who are recruiting in your community. Common Questions Q: The son or daughter of an old friend is being actively recruited by a USC coach. Do Ihave to stop having any contact with the prospect and his or her parents? A: No, you may continue to enjoy the same relationship with the family that you had before. You may not, however, use your relationship to urge that the son or daughter chooses USC, and you may not allow a coach to enlist you in the recruitment process. Q: What should Ido if Iencounter a prospect while watching my son or daughter's high school athletic contest? A: The NCAA rules prohibit boosters from having in-person contacts with prospects.   However, the rules recognize that a booster may inadvertently (without prearrangement) come into contact with a prospect. In this situation, the booster may exchange polite greetings with the prospect, but must then terminate the encounter.  The exception does NOT apply if the contact occurs at the prospect's school, or at a site where the prospect is competing. In these circumstances, NO contact of any kind is permitted. Q: May Iattend a public event - for example; a community picnic or a high school banquet or awards dinner - if prospects are also in attendance? A: Yes, you may. Be sure, though, that you do not have any contact with the prospects. What Is An Extra Benefit? An extra benefit is any special arrangement to provide a student-athlete or the student-athlete's relatives or friends with a benefit not authorized by the NCAA rules. The NCAA allows USC to provide student-athletes with scholarships to cover tuition, fees, room, board and books. We can also provide complimentary admissions to USC athletic events, practice or competition-related apparel, equipment and medical treatment. It is a violation of NCAA rules for a student-athlete to receive any other benefit UNLESS the same benefit is normally available to all USC students or their parents/guardians. Examples of Extra Benefits a Booster Cannot Provide:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Cash Arranging, providing or co-signing a loan Providing any kind of transportation or the use of a car Tickets to collegiate, professional or any sporting event. Gifts of food, clothing or equipment Arranging or providing free or reduced cost telephone services, housing or professional services Arranging or providing employment for a student-athlete's parents, guardians or friends"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What May A Booster Provide? You may provide an \"occasional\" meal at your home for a student-athlete or an entire team if you live within a 30-mile radius of USC's main campus. You may also provide transportation to your home for the meal. The term \"occasional\" has been interpreted to be no more than once per year. You may provide a job to prospects that have signed a letter of intent to attend USC. For addition you may employ an enrolled student-athlete under certain circumstances with prior approval from the USC Athletic Department. Student-athletes who are not freshmen may receive employment income in certain situations. Both the student-athlete and the employer must sign a written statement PRIOR to beginning any employment during the academic year. Student-athletes may be compensated only for work actually performed and at a rate commensurate with the going rate in the area for similar services. The general limit on employment earnings that do not count towards NCAA limits is $2,000 annually, not including official vacation periods. Common Questions Q: May Igive a discount on clothing, food or car rentals to student-athletes as part of my business? A: No. Adiscount that is specifically designed for student-athletes is considered an extra benefit and against NCAA rules. However, if you provide a discount to all USC students or the general public, then student-athletes can also receive the discount.

The more the public understands the U.S. regulatory process regarding agricultural biotechnology, the more confidence people will have in the government's ability to protect the food supply and the environment, Lambert told the Senate Agriculture Committee June 14. U.S. biotechnology regulation is coordinated among the Animal Plant Health and Inspections Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Agricultural biotechnology \"is a science that is rapidly evolving,\" and it is \"critical\" that U.S. regulators keep pace with the new technology, Lambert said. In response to the rapid growth of biotechnology, APHIS has taken steps to strengthen its regulations further for field tests of genetically engineered crops to ensure the safety of agriculture and the environment and to improve compliance with and enforcement of those regulations, he said. USDA first began regulating biotechnology in 1986, he said. Biotechnology is \"the single largest influence changing agriculture since the introduction of the cultivator,\" said Senator Saxby Chambliss, Georgia Republican and chairman of the committee. Acultivator is a tool used for loosening soil and destroying weeds around growing plants. Researchers are developing genetically engineered pharmaceutical and industrial compounds using rice, maize, barley, tobacco and safflower, Lambert said. The products being developed include chemicals, vaccines, antibodies for humans, and blood proteins, he said. APHIS regulates the interstate movement, importation and release of genetically engineered plants, insects and microorganisms. EPA regulates biotechnology-derived products used as pesticides. FDA's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition oversees bioengineered plant-derived food and ingredients intended for human consumption. Its Center for Veterinary Medicine oversees genetically engineered plant-derived products used as animal feed or as ingredients in animal feed, and bioengineered products used to improve the health or productivity of animals. For more information on biotechnology, see Agricultural Biotechnology . Following is the text of Lambert's prepared testimony: Senate Agriculture Committee Review Future Agriculture and Food Biotechnology Developments June 14, 2005 Hon. Chuck Lambert Deputy Under Secretary USDA Marketing and Regulatory Programs Thank you for the opportunity to be here today. Iam pleased to provide the Committee with an overview of the Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) role in regulating agricultural biotechnology. This is a science that is rapidly evolving, and as Federal regulators it’s critical that we keep pace with this new technology. Here at USDA, we’re committed to meeting not only the challenges that we can see ahead on the horizon but also those that science has yet to discover. Since USDA first began regulating biotechnology in 1986, we have deregulated more than 60 genetically engineered (GE) agricultural products. In that time, we have also overseen more than 10,000 biotech field tests. It’s the responsibility of USDA to thoroughly evaluate GE organisms to verify that they are just as safe for agriculture and the environment as traditionally bred crop varieties, which have been the cornerstone of American agriculture. This is a responsibility that we share with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), who are also here today. Under what is known as the Coordinated Framework, we work in concert to ensure that biotech crops are safe not only for agriculture and the environment, but also the food supply. This coordinated effort is critical for reassuring industry, consumers, and other groups—both here in the United States and, increasingly, abroad—that biotechnology-derived crops, animal vaccines, and other products are rigorously regulated for safety. Regulatory Overview For its part in this coordinated effort, USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), under the Plant Protection Act, regulates the interstate movement, importation and field release of GE plants, insects and microorganisms through permitting and notification procedures. In other areas, APHIS regulates biotechnology-derived veterinary biologics under the Virus-Serum toxin Act. The Agency is also evaluating its role in the regulation of GE animals, pathogens and pests under the authority of the Animal Health Protection Act, which was passed as part of the 2002 Farm Bill. The regulation of GE plants, however, is where APHIS has the most regulatory focus. The Agency has long recognized that plant-derived biotechnology research was increasing and becoming much more complex. In order to ensure that the Agency remained at the forefront in developing appropriate regulatory policies to address the latest advances in the technology, APHIS created Biotechnology Regulatory Services (BRS) in June of 2002. The program, which started with 25 employees, has grown to a staff of more than 50. In the last 3 years, the program has made a number of changes to review and further strengthen USDA’s existing biotechnology regulations. During this time, BRS has also made a concerted effort to reach out to stakeholders interested in biotechnology, including industry, non-governmental organizations, States and others to make sure that they fully understand the important regulatory changes that have taken place. In general, APHIS’ field testing requirements for regulated plants are designed to prevent the unintentional environmental introduction, whether by pollen movement, seed or grain commingling, or other means, of a protein or trait produced in these plants that would present a risk or potential risk to agricultural crops or the environment. Companies, universities and other researchers that wish to field test such crops must submit permit applications, with information about the plant variety being tested, the purpose of the test, how it will be conducted, as well as the specific confinement conditions taken to prevent the escape of pollen, plants, or plant parts from the field test site. Applicants must also detail how the site will be destroyed once the field test is complete to prevent persistence in the environment. The planting conditions detailed in the application must meet or exceed the stringent requirements set forth by APHIS. These requirements are specific to each plant variety, and we continually evaluate them to ensure that the latest scientific evidence is taken into account. APHIS also has a streamlined permitting process, called notification, in place. Most of the field tests carried out in the United States are authorized under the notification process. The notification process expedites approvals for field testing for certain types of low-risk plants that APHIS has considerable experience in regulating. Under the notification procedure, the regulated article to be field tested must be a plant, and the genetic modifications to that plant must meet established criteria. During the permitting and notification process, APHIS also takes into account the requirements of NEPA. Iwant to emphasize that APHIS is committed to ensuring that State interests are fully considered and accommodated in the Agency’s biotechnology field test permit and notification review processes. Before any field test can be undertaken in a given State, APHIS officials provide detailed information pertaining to the proposed field test to their counterparts in that State for review and concurrence. If a particular State has science-based concerns about the confinement measures described in the documentation, APHIS works with that State to address the outstanding concerns and add any additional conditions the State deems necessary to ensure that the field test can be conducted safely. The Agency has never approved a field test permit over the objections of State counterparts. Pharmaceuticals and Industrials Science is moving rapidly for crops producing pharmaceuticals and industrial, and APHIS has taken a proactive approach to safely regulating these types of field tests. APHIS’ recent efforts to strengthen regulations have provided additional assurances to States that field trials are safe for agriculture and the environment. In 2003, APHIS imposed new measures for all crops genetically engineered to produce pharmaceuticals and industrials. Developers are producing pharmaceutical and industrial compounds using rice, corn, barley, tobacco, and safflower. These crops are grown to produce research chemicals, vaccines, human antibodies, and human blood proteins. Although there has been much attention on these products, relatively few pharmaceutical and industrial field tests have actually taken place. About 90 permits to field test pharmaceutical and industrial crops have been issued since 1991 in about 15 States. In comparison, we’ve approved thousands of field tests for GE crops as a whole. This is an area of research, however, where we expect to see more growth and that’s why we’ve made changes in our regulatory process to make clear that pharmaceutical and industrial crops are evaluated rigorously. APHIS issues permits for pharmaceuticals and industrials on a case-by-case basis. The Agency also conducts environmental assessments, which include public comment periods, whenever required under the National Environmental Policy Act and based on established safety criteria. APHIS further imposes stringent confinement measures requiring increased isolation distances and fallow zones, dedicated farm equipment, and restrictions on planting food or feed crops on land used to produce pharmaceutical and industrial crops. For example, the isolation distance for open-pollinated corn is 1 mile. This means that such a field test cannot be planted within 1 mile of other corn crops. To ensure that these permit conditions are being met, APHIS inspectors conduct at least 5 inspections during the growing season for all pharmaceutical and industrial crops. These inspections coincide with key times during the growing season: pre-planting, after planting, just prior to harvest, at harvest, and post harvest. After the field test is complete, Agency inspectors follow up with two additional inspections to ensure that the plot was completely destroyed and no left over plants remain. These volunteer plants, if detected, must be immediately destroyed. Compliance Compliance with APHIS’ stringent permit conditions is high, and that is due in large part to the Agency’s efforts to work with researchers to ensure that they understand our requirements and can implement them in the field. Given the growing scope and complexity of biotechnology, now more than ever, APHIS recognizes the need for scientifically sound, effective safeguards and greater transparency of the regulatory process to ensure that all those involved in the field testing of GE crops understand and adhere to the regulations set forth by BRS. This need is echoed by the biotech industry, stakeholders, and consumers. To that end, in 2003, APHIS’ Biotechnology Regulatory Services established a new Compliance and Enforcement unit to further ensure adherence to permit conditions. In addition to ensuring that permit conditions and recordkeeping requirements are met by researchers, APHIS has also instituted new training programs for inspectors who inspect and audit field trials of GE crops. This ensures inspectors know what to look for in the field and that they handle each inspection with consistency and uniformity. The unit also encourages self-reporting by researchers should they identify a potential infraction. Under APHIS regulations, companies, universities and other researchers are immediately required to report, verbally and in writing, any potential problems, so that the issue can be resolved as quickly as possible in order to confine the transgenic organisms. Deregulation After successfully completing the field-testing and data collection stage of a new plant variety’s development, a permit holder can petition APHIS to deregulate the biotechnology crop. In support of this petition, the permit holder must submit further information on the results of the field-testing, in addition to information documenting that the plant poses no risk to agricultural crops or the environment. In considering the petition, APHIS carefully reviews the data submitted by the permit holder, and also weighs other pertinent scientific studies and information. When APHIS deregulates a biotechnology-derived plant, it does so because the plant poses no pest risk to other crops or plants. After submission of a complete petition, deregulation process requires that APHIS publish a Federal Register notice thereby making the documents available to the public and providing the public with an opportunity to comment. Once APHIS deregulates a particular biotechnology product, the company must still comply with applicable FDA or EPA requirements prior to marketing. In addition, APHIS can bring a product back under regulation at any time if the Agency becomes aware of evidence indicating that the product may pose some sort of plant pest risk. Environmental Impact Statement Efforts to further strengthen our regulations and improve compliance and enforcement have improved our ability to protect agriculture and the environment while allowing for the safe field testing of GE crops. However, as I’ve mentioned throughout my testimony, we recognize that the science of biotechnology is going to continue to evolve and we must be prepared to keep pace with those changes. That is why in January of 2004, APHIS announced plans to review and strengthen APHIS’ current biotechnology regulations. As a result of that announcement, APHIS is currently conducting a programmatic Environmental Impact Statement to evaluate our biotechnology regulations. The decision to undertake this EIS is the result of inter-agency discussions, which included our sister agencies, EPA and FDA. The EIS, which is currently being drafted, evaluates environmental issues associated with potential revisions to existing regulations. Under the Plant Protection Act of 2000, APHIS has broad authority to safeguard American agriculture and protect the environment. The EIS will look at expanding APHIS’ regulatory scope beyond GE organisms that may pose a plant pest risk to include GE plants that may pose a noxious weed risk and GE organisms that could be used as biological control agents. As part of the EIS, APHIS is also evaluating the benefit of developing new criteria, based on risk, familiarity, and intended use for reviewing applications to conduct GE crop field tests. Under the proposed approach, APHIS would move away from our current system of permits and notifications in favor a multi-tiered permitting system. This new system would utilize the knowledge we’ve gained about biotechnology in the last 19 years to help streamline the permit process for familiar field tests, so we can focus our resources and attention on new requests with which we have less experience. Over time, this science-based approach would reduce the regulatory burden and allow APHIS to concentrate oversight on new GE products based on science and potential risk. The EIS will also consider the environmental effects of exempting, from regulation, the low-level and intermittent occurrence of certain GE organisms that have not completed all applicable review, provided they meet safety criteria and there has been adherence to regulatory requirements. This issue is known by many as adventitious presence. While I’ve briefly highlighted some of the main issues, the EIS is much more broad in scope. In fact, the current programmatic review of BRS’ existing biotechnology regulations is USDA’s largest effort of its kind since the Coordinated Framework for biotechnology regulations was first established in 1986. We’ve established an ambitious timeline for completing the comprehensive draft EIS and hope to publish the document in the Federal Register this fall. Throughout this initiative we will continue to coordinate with our interagency partners and communicate with the public to hear their views and ensure that they understand what it is that we’re considering. As a result of the initial scoping process we’ve already received more than 2,000 public comments. APHIS also held several days of meetings to hear from interested stakeholders, including industry, non-governmental organizations and others. As a follow up to that process, BRS will again be reaching out to the public this summer by holding open forums once a month to hear from anyone interested in our regulatory review. These comments will all be considered as we continue to move forward in this process. Finally, I’d like to close by saying that our emphasis on communications is part of an on-going effort to be more transparent regarding the regulatory process. The easier it is for people to understand our regulations, the more confidence we believe they will have in APHIS’ ability to protect agriculture and the environment. We’re very excited about the regulatory changes that have already occurred as well as those that are on the horizon. In partnership with our sister Agencies FDA and EPA, we’re confident that we’re ready for the future of agricultural biotechnology. Thank you again for the opportunity to be here. I’m happy to answer any questions that you may have."}]}

Hanson: How odd to suggest that when the now demonized policy, which Isupported, of staying on after the removal of Saddam Hussein to allow elections for the Iraqis was most certainly based on the utopian idea that Muslims themselves were quite capable of consensual government as we see in Turkey or Indonesia. So it is up to Arab Muslims to prove that ideal was also true of the Arab Middle East, and show that Palestine and Iraq can stabilize and conduct democracy under the rule of law. Another piece of advise to you, as a moderate Muslim in the West: the present U.S. policy was about as good as the Middle East was going to get, this engagement that saw billions spent in Afghanistan and Iraq for democracy, and real American pressure exerted on behalf on the people of Lebanon, Egypt, and the Gulf States to have a say in their governments. So we are at a great crossroads: when the world's only superpower puts its money and lives behind the idea of consensual government for Arab Muslims, will they tweak and fidget about the infidel's hubris, or use the opening for their own purposes of reform? And a word of warning as well: if Iraq should fail, and if there should be another 9/11 traced to a terrorist-sponsoring Arab nation, and celebrated once more by the proverbial Arab Street, then for the next half century the United States will write off all notion of reform and liberalization and just deal, as we see with the return of the realists, with the Middle East as it is. And that means tough, obliterating retaliatory strikes to each terrorist provocation, without much concern for illiberal conditions on the ground that so enhance the opportunistic terrorists.

It is designed for assessing\nsituations in which the eye is illuminated, either to provide a stimulus\nor to illuminate it for photography, videography or direct observation.\nThe optical radiation safety calculator performs calculations for radiation\nat visible wavelengths (400-700 nm), and near infrared (700-1400 nm). 1. Radiometry basics 2. Types of ocular exposure 3. Using the program 4. Glossary 5. References 1. Radiometry basics The basic principles of radiometry can be found elsewhere (link to W&Sref), but will be presented here in brief. Measurements can be made either\nin terms of radiometric units, which correspond to raw energy or power,\nor photometric units, which are corrected for visibility. When dealing\nwith safety issues, we are primarily concerned with radiometric measures;\nthe same principles apply to photometric measurements, however, so when\nwe use a radiometric term, the corresponding photometric term will be listed\nin parentheses. The basic radiometric (photometric) measurements are irradiance (illuminance)\nand radiance (luminance). Irradiance describes the total power falling\non a surface (such as the surface of a detector, or a tissue surface in\nthe eye). The units of irradiance are expressed in power per unit area,\ntypically Watts per centimeter squared (W/cm²). When a surface is irradiated with a certain amount of power, the energy\ncomes from a source. Most sources are distributed in space, that is, they\nhave some finite size. (This size approaches zero for a perfectly collimated\nbeam, such as might be emitted by a laser.) The radiance of a source is\nsimply the irradiance it produces, divided by the size of the source, where\nthe size is expressed as the solid angle (in steradians) subtended by the\nsource from the point at which the measurement is made. Alittle reflection\nshould make it clear that the radiance of a source is independent of the\ndistance at which the measurement is made: if we double the distance from\nthe source, the irradiance will decrease by a factor of 4 (inverse square\nlaw); but the apparent size of the source will also decrease by a factor\nof 4, and the two factors cancel out. 2. Types of ocular exposure For considerations of eye safety, there are two principle areas of concern:\nthe first is corneal irradiance. When optical radiation (particularly infrared)\nstrikes the cornea, it can heat and dry it, causing damage to the tissue.\n(Infrared radiation can also cause damage to soft contact lenses at levels\nthat are considered safe for eye exposure, but to my knowledge there is\nno published data on this!) The second area of concern is retinal irradiation. Damage to the retina\ncan cause areas of local blindness (\"scotomas\"). The calculation of retinal\nirradiance is fairly straightforward: the total amount of power entering\nthe eye can be calculated as the product of the corneal irradiance times\nthe effective pupil area . The illuminated area of\nretina will be an image of the source, subtending the same angle from the\nposterior nodal point as the source does from the anterior nodal point.\nTherefore, the retinal area is simply the product of the solid angle subtended\nby the source (in steradians) and the posterior nodal distance of the eye. To convert retinal irradiance to radiance, we need to divide by the\nsource solid angle; but at the retina, the apparent source is the exit\npupil of the eye, so this is the relevant measure. It can be shown by a\nlittle algebra that this is identically equal to the original source radiance! For the calculations we assume that the source is uniform. This assumption\nmay be violated for real sources; for example, a lamp filament will have\n\"hot spots\" where the local radiance is higher than the average radiance.\nIn these situations, it is best to use a diffuser to homogenize the source\nimage. Diffractive optical elements capable of diffusing a beam within\na narrow angular range (such as those manufactured by Physical Optics Corporation)\nare ideal for this application. 3. Using the program Detector diameter. Acircular detector area is assumed. For a circular detector, simply\nenter the diameter in millimeters of the active surface. For a non-circular\ndetector, calculate the area (in mm²), then divide by pi (3.14159), take\nthe square root of the result and multiply by 2 to obtain the equivalent\ndiameter. Wavelength Amonochromatic or narrow band source is assumed. For a broadband infrared\nsource, the value here is not too critical, because the calculations are\nnot too wavelength dependent. To be conservative, use a value of xxx nm.\nBroadband visible sources are more problematic, because the \"blue light\nhazard\" function has a sharp peak at 4xx nm. Source dimensions at pupil These parameters are most relevant for setups (such as Maxwellian view\noptical systems) where the source is imaged in the pupil by a system of\none or more lenses. In the case where the source image is smaller than\nthe natural pupil (assumed to be 7 mm), the source area is used for the effective pupil area . For cases where the entire\neye/face is illuminated directly by a source, the values here do not really\nmatter, as long as they are larger than 7mm. Apparent size and distance of the source For free viewing of a source, simply enter the actual size and distance\n(in millimeters). For Maxwellian view, where the final lens appears uniformly\nfilled with light, use the diameter and distance of the lens. Detector power Enter the power measurement in microwatts. 4. Glossary Effective pupil area: The area of the pupil\nthrough which light passes. Under free viewing conditions, this is usually\njust the area of the natural pupil. It can be smaller than the natural\npupil under special conditions, such as viewing through a small artificial\npupil, or when using an instrument with a small exit pupil such as a Maxwellian\nview optical system. 5. References Optical Radiation Safety Calculator"}]}

To me, that would be like changing my face; it's such a central part of my identity. It was never even a possibility for me. Plus, Ican never remember any of the last names of the few friends Ihave who have changed their last names. I've even met a few parents who forget what their own daughter's last name is after she changes it! It' actually a bit disturbing when someone changes their name, I'm very attached to permanence. Iwas also surprised to find how happy it made my father when he found out Iwas keeping my (and his) last name. Most men Iknow seem to think that keeping my last name is admirable. However, my husband's family does not approve. They are too intimidated to say anything to me about it though, and its a good thing, because they don't want to get into an argument with me about a tradition based on women as property!! Also, when we have a child, it will have my last name. Both parents are generally equal, but I'm the one that has to carry the dang kid in my body for 9 months, so the balance is shifted in my favor. My husband agrees with that logic. 5.18.2005 6:34pm ( link ) Jana ( mail ): Ididn't change my last name when Igot married, instead my husband took my last name.   He didn't feel all that attached to his last name since his family is scattered, and he knew that Idid feel attached to my last name, so it just seemed like the natural choice for us.  But that being said, had he not been receptive to taking my name Iwould have taken his, or we might have came up with a different new last name for both of us.   We feel stongly that we have the same name that our kids do.  It just seems easier that way, and Iwouldn't want anybody to mistakenly think my child was from a broken home. 5.18.2005 7:05pm ( link ) Kelly: Iview my name as part of my identity, and while Iappreciate the \"family unity\" argument, Ialso wasn't comfortable with changing my name just because Igot married. My mother (married in 1969 and a feminist) took Dad's name, and she said it was easier to change her name and it was a man's name anyways.  For me, it's not about it being a man's name, it's about the name Iwas born with, got used to, practice under and associate myself with. And it also seems a little unfair that the default is that the woman changes her name.  If both change to a new name, that seems much more equitable. Unlike some women who kept their names, Ihave no qualms about being called by my husband's last name, and Ioccasionally offer that name in social settings for convenience purposes. We get mail with all sorts of combinations of our last names. Ido not care what other people call me, Iam not bothered in the least to be called by his name -- Isimply did not want to change my  name professionally or with my friends and family. Children pose a problem.  There is a family unity issue there (of course, Iam no less my husband's wife if Ido not share his name, so Iam no less my child's mother if Ido not share her name), but there's also a convenience issue - you'll have to take extra steps to prove that you're the spouse or mother if your name isn't the same.  Therefore, if we have children, we'll review my decision, and perhaps even choose a new last name for all of us. FWIW, my name is English and my husband's name is hard to pronounce when read, hard to spell when heard, and is ethnic (and Iam not that ethnicity).   He uses my name when we order pizza. 5.18.2005 8:04pm ( link ) Tracy Wilkinson: Ididn't change my name mostly for practical reasons.

Practically it's worked out fine.  I've never had any problems convincing people that we're married, including when we've travelled overseas.  His family and a few of my friends write letters to me addressed with his last name, and Ikeep meaning to get around to telling them that Ihaven't changed it.  Occasionally people comment, but never negatively. We haven't had kids.  If we do Ithink I'll give them both names, with my surname as a middle name.  Iwill also make sure their first names don't have any alternative spellings.  They can use whatever name they like to make restaurant bookings. As to why their surname first - my husband's surname is unusual and Iquite like maintaining diversity. 5.18.2005 8:10pm ( link ) anonymouse ( mail ): Ihave been married for just over two years. Ihad never considered changing my name. Ilike my last name; Iidentify with my father; I'm an only child, and Iwanted to keep the name around at least one more generation. My husband never asked, and it never really occurred to me to change my name. It's also the case that I've published a couple papers, but Idon't really respect those publications enough to care. Mostly, Ididn't want to be someone else, Iwanted to be myself, and Ithought that changing my name would make me sad. Sometimes Iwonder sometimes if it wasn't silly of me to keep it. Ifeel a bit guilty that people refer to my husband as Mr. Mylastname--I'm the one most involved in our community, the one who signs the bills, and many times people here just assume we have the same name. Ihaven't thought about the kids' name problem yet. re: practicality: it's never been an issue for me, but then again, no one misnames me; they misname my husband. Never had any issues with bills or paperwork. 5.18.2005 9:33pm ( link ) Dawn Park ( mail ): Ididn't change my last name because Iwas just too darn lazy to go through the hassle of changing all of my documents--driver's license, passport, social security card credit cards, etc..  I'm not particularly attached to my name considering it's an arbitrary transliteration of my Korean name.  Actually, my first name isn't the one Iwas born with, but rather one that was randomly selected by my sister after we arrived in the states. I've encountered a small amount of confusion by not having changed my name, but nothing monumental.  Our children have my husband's name because that's convention and Ireally don't care one way or the other. 5.18.2005 10:01pm ( link ) Laura ( mail ): Idid not change my name upon marriage because: (1) Ihad already begun to establish myself as a lawyer with my maiden name;  (2) Iliked the sound of my name as it was;  (3) changing my name seemed (and still seems) tantamount to changing my identity.  So, a professional reason, a stylistic one, and a personal one. No children as of yet, but they will have my husband's name, Isuppose.  Socially, Idon't think I'll mind being addressed as Mrs. Husbandslastname, particularly if it reduces confusion with the children. 5.18.2005 10:49pm ( link ) Lynne ( mail ) ( www ): 1. Ialready had publications under my given name. 2. Icouldn't be bothered to go through all of the bureaucratic hassle on SSN, credit cards, 401K, etc. Interestingly, Inever thought of it as an identity thing one way or the other, nothing philosophical. 5.18.2005 11:37pm ( link ) David Has to Add Something Because David's Taken: Well, I'm not the party to the marriage whom you addressed, but Itook my wife's last name. I'm happy to read Jana's note above, as this is the closest I've come to meeting anybody else who's done the same. Why did we do it? We were set on having the same name in order to signal our attachment and make things less confusing for our children and those who encounter them. We seriously considered inventing a new name, especially as a combination of our names, but none of the possible combinations proved very attractive. In the end, she was more attached to her name and family than Iwas to mine, and her name was also more aesthetically interesting. 5.19.2005 1:02am ( link ) dgm ( mail ) ( www ): Ikept my family name because Iconsider it part of \"who Iam.\" Igot married when Iwas 30, but Iwould have kept the name even in my 20s, before Istarted on the career path.  Ilike the sound of it, and had Itaken the mate's name, Iwould have converted my own into something bovine: Donna Bell.  Ugh. Our two kids have both our last names, which Ithink makes it easier for future geneologists.  (Besides, my husband insisted they have his last name, too ;-) )Idon't buy the argument that we can't signal family unity unless we all share the same name. Ithink it's pretty clear by our names that we are all from the same family unit. Ithink this has worked out well, and Icertainly have no regrets about my or my kids' names. Sometimes Ihave to take a little extra time to explain to people that we all have different but related last names (like when we make airline reservations), but the only time it bothers me is when Ihave to have the discussion (over and over)with my own friends, especially those who've known me long before Igot married. Incidentally, I'm surprised at how few women have commented on this compared to the number of commenters on your previous post for those who changed their names.  Are we really that much in the minority?? 5.19.2005 8:46am ( link ) Mr. & Ms.: I'm going to chime in, despite being the wrong gender, as my wife and Iboth wrestled with the question of which, if either, of us should change names.  We ultimately decided to keep ours. Best as Ican tell, this has posed a problem once in four years of marriage, and then only a minor one: when checking in at an airport in a small city in the South (and plausible marriage or honeymoon destination), we had this conversation: Me: We're both checking in, please.  Two bags. Agent: Which bag is whose? Me: Oh, it doesn't matter, we're married. Agent: Oh...the reservations are in different names.  [starts consulting policy manual]  Do you have your marriage license? Me: What do we need that for?  The tickets match our IDs. Agent: Aha!  How exciting.  Congratulations! Me: [confused] Agent: How long have you been married? Me: Uh, a bit over two years. Agent: [confused] We got our boarding passes and made a speedy getaway. Isee the appeal in the one-name, one-family thing, but it's just not important-seeming enough to be worth the hassle and the inequity.  Isuspect that if we have two kids, one will get each name--fairer that way, and Ithink it can actually be really advantageous for younger siblings not to be automatically lumped with their older siblings. But Ihave no objection to going by Mr. [wife's name], either, and Ioften use her name for reservations (it's easier to spell). 5.19.2005 9:28am ( link ) Christine Hurt ( mail ) ( www ): Imarried eight years ago and kept my last name.  Our kids have Paul's last name, and contrary to warnings, this has not proved too complicated.  We live in a complicated world of blended families where not everyone has the same last name, so Ithink the world is used to some texture.  Ifelt strongly about keeping my name at the time, but over time Ican barely remember why.  My daughter (aged 6) wants to change her last name to my last name.  Iguess if she wants to when she's older, Idon't care, although Ithink her father might! 5.19.2005 9:58am ( link ) Alice Marie Beard: My husband and Imarried in 1974. Iwas 23. I'd never considered any option other than keeping my own name. At the same time, I've always understood and felt comfortable with the knowledge that Iam \"Mrs. Husband's Name.\" Our children, 26 and 21, have hyphenated names, with their dad's name first. That way, in case they ever opted to drop my part of their last name, they'd already be alphabetized just fine. When Iwas in high school, we had an exchange student from Chile: Adolfo Henriquez y Chacon (a man who has gone on to become a brilliant petroleum engineer). He spent much of his year in that little small town in Indiana explaining his last name to some rather unworldly Hoosier kids. His explanation seemed obvious to me, and it's the pattern Ichose to adopt for my children. There is an advantage to having kept my own name that Inever anticipated: It turns out that my Polish DP husband has done quite well in his area of the law. With my own name, Ican \"fly under the radar.\" And, when Iopt to let people know the connection, Ijust add \"Mrs. Husband's Name\" after my name. Having kept my own name was easier (no name-change forms to file) and has meant that Idid not vanish behind a new name. These links may be of interest: Dunn v. Palermo , 522 S.W. 2d 679 (Tenn 1975) ; a 1925 magazine article titled \"Do You Use Your Husband's Name?\" ; a piece by Hofstra law professor Joanna Grossman, \"What's in a name?\" ; a newspaper article by me from 1974, \" Legal issues of married woman who keep their own names.\" Frankly, Inever would have considered marrying a man who was not bright enough to understand WHY a woman might opt to keep her own name. 5.19.2005 11:23am ( link ) Iris Engelson: Imarried eight years ago at the age of 36 and never seriously considered changing my name.  Well, that's not entirely accurate:  I'd have considered hyphenating if my husband had wanted to do that (and I'd only have considered it if we BOTH hyphenated).  As it happens, though, the combination of our names wasn't terribly euphonious and neither of us was too keen on making the change. Different last names are fairly common in our social circle (we live on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, in New York City) and the convention we used for our son's name (Firstname Middlename Mylastname Hislastname, with no hyphen) is also fairly common.   Between the different last names and the mutually agreed upon hyphenations, Ithink that couples in which she took his name might even be in the minority. Iam entirely in agreement with Eugene's reaction to the idea of name changing:  my answer to 'why did you keep your name?' would probably have to be 'why on earth would Ichange it?'  The minor inconvenience of having to introduce myself these days as \"Iris Engelson, xxxx yyyy's Mom\" when calling schools, pediatricians or parents of my son's friends hardly seems a compelling reason to jettison the name Ihave used all my life. On the other hand, Inever had a problem with my son's having my husband's last name.  Idid want my last name to be included as a middle name, though, and Iam careful to include all four names on all official documents, lest Iever have any problems when we are traveling. 5.19.2005 11:32am ( link ) pwdcrazy ( mail ): Ididn't change my name because: 1) Ihad publications under my maiden name; 2) The paperwork would be a nightmare (including what was then the INS); 3) Iam a very different ethicity from my husband, and calling myself by his last name seemed utterly incongrous. Our child has my husband's last name, and Idon't care if I'm addressed socially as Mrs. (Husband's Last Name), or in reference to our child. 5.19.2005 12:01pm ( link ) meep ( mail ) ( www ): Igot married in my mid-20s, and Ididn't see any reason to legally change my name. Iown quite a few things in my name, and seeing the trouble my mother went through just trying to get my deceased father's name off of deeds and titles would indicate it would be a supreme pain in the ass. Get my Social Security record changed? Get name on diplomas changed? What's the point? That's asking for administrative trouble. That said, Idon't mind being called Mrs. Husband's Name (and I'm super-traditional. Iwould prefer to be addressed Mrs. [Husband's first name] [Husband's last name] to Mrs. [my first name] [Husband's last name]... because Ilike being difficult.) Iwill introduce myself as Mrs. So-and-so to people who have to deal with our kids. Most people know my last name, though, and so I'm not called Mrs. So-and-so that often. Perhaps when the kids are older. Ilook at it from a purely practical point of view, and don't see why my socially used name(s) must be the same as my legal name. In my family: after my father died, my mother remarried. But she didn't change her name upon remarriage. So she's Mrs. Dead-husband's-name. Legally and socially. Only a few people have remarked on it, but most people just accept it. She was married to my Dad before she graduated college, so perhaps she had come to identify it as her own. Or perhaps she didn't want to go through the crap of changing all the paperwork. Or perhaps she wanted to have the same last name as her kids. Or perhaps just pure sentimental reasons. Idon't know. My middle sister has done as Ihave -- socially, she goes by husband's name, hasn't changed her legal name. My youngest sister does not go by her husband's name at all. All of us got married in our 20s, after we graduated college (and gotten masters degrees). Oh, and none of us have done the hyphenated-name thing to the kids. They have their fathers' last names. 5.19.2005 1:05pm ( link ) Susan West: Ichanged my name several years before Imet my husband because Iwanted something easy to spell and pronounce. Iwasn't likely to change it again (although contrary to what other posters have said, it wasn't that much work in the first place -- in fact it was surprisingly simple). Ialso wasn't likely to take his name because Ialways thought that was really silly, particularly in the context of a traditional wedding. The bride shows up wearing a hat that makes her look like an alien landed on her head with a veil covering her face (and therefore masking her identity). Carol Springer marries David Anderson, and at the end the officiator introduces \"Mr. and Mrs. David Anderson.\" Where did Carol Springer go? The whole ceremony seems designed to strip the bride of her entire identity through the costumes and the name change -- clearly a reflection of the historical view of women as property. Not my style. Ido resent when people call my by my husband's name. Ifind it irksome that they are so presumptuous as to assume that Iam subservient to him, and so 1950s that they still apply this default. Irecently checked my info on Lexis and found that although the title to our home, and the mortgage for it, are both listed in both of our names, the Lexis database shows me with his last name. Who on earth thought it was their business to give me an entirely new name? Makes me crazy. Our daughter has my last name. We never considered any other option. It would have been the same if she'd been a son. My husband's parents would have been apoplectic over this if they hadn't been so relieved to finally have a grandchild. Given how unlikely this was to happen at all, they would have been delighted if we'd named her Baby Doe. My husband thought about taking my last name, but ultimately Ididn't want him to because no one would have believed that he had taken my name rather than that Ihad taken his. Iwanted the names to be different so that my identity was never subsumed under his. We've never had problems being treated as a family, even though we have different last names, and no one has ever assumed (out loud anyway) that our daughter is not legitimate. This may come from us being older parents (late 30s when she was born) and having been married for many years before her arrival. But who knows what people are really thinking (and frankly, who cares). 5.19.2005 3:35pm ( link ) Castiron ( mail ): Ididn't change my name because Icouldn't think of any good reason to change it that wouldn't equally apply to my husband.   (As we ultimately divorced, I'm glad Ididn't have the hassle of deciding whether to keep his name or revert to my old one, but \"it's one less hassle if we divorce\" was not one of my reasons.)  We did consider both taking a new surname, and even had a name that we agreed on, but he felt it would be too expensive to do a name change that his home country would accept, so we both kept our names.  Our son's name is hyphenated; we find that the hypenated last name is no big deal, certainly not nearly as much trouble as the boy's having four middle names (traditional in father's home country)! If Ishould marry again, I'm not planning to take my husband's name, unless he happens to have my maternal grandmother's rare surname. I'll be happy for both of us to hyphenate our names together or to change to a different surname; he can even take my surname if he really wants to. 5.19.2005 4:25pm ( link ) Cal Lanier ( mail ) ( www ): Igot married at 24 and never considered changing my name. My son has his dad's last name, first because it wasn't that big a deal to me and second because my family name is carrying on courtesy of two other nephews and a horde of cousins, whereas my son is the only son of an only son. (His middle name, which is also the name he goes by, is my family name.) Names are fundamental to identity for me. I've used the same online name for years and would have a huge problem changing it, never mind the one Iwas born with. For the life of me Ican't see what issues are involved with family members having different last names. Legal or bureaucratically, I've never spent 5 seconds extra because my son has his dad's name and Idon't. The \"family unity\" argument has never made any sense to me, either. It's supposed to convince outsiders that the spouses really do love each other, or what? Idon't really care whether women change their name or not, but for some reason Igo absolutely nuts at women who say \"Oh, Icouldn't wait to change my name! I've always hated it!\" Smackdown time. 5.19.2005 4:34pm ( link ) Rebecca ( mail ): Iam getting married in September and Iintend to change my last name to my husband's name. Iam a practicing attorney and Ithink the name change will initially be impractical for my colleagues, but Isuppose that's just life. Iconsidered not changing my name, but in the end it was important to me to be his wife not just his best friend and partner. In my mind, assuming the same last name is a symbol of a couple's unity that goes beyond their partnership and commitment. Idon't feel as though Iam becoming a member of his family as much as he and Iare becoming our own family. Sharing a name is a strong symbol of the indisolubility of our marriage. Concededly, the same end would have been achieved by him taking my name, but Isimply prefer his name. 5.20.2005 10:56am ( link ) mikeunique3222 ( mail ): I'm married to a Japanese woman. My father-in-law changed his name to my mother-in-law's name, because she had no brothers, while he had brothers. By changing his name, he could continue the family line of his wife, my mother-in-law. This is fairly common in Japan, at least in rural areas. My wife changed her name to mine. Having a non-Japanese name presents some hassles for her, but having a name different from her husband would present another set of hassles. The Japanese wife of a UK friend of mine stuck with her maiden name for a few years, but gave in when they had children. The Japanese wife of a US friend uses her maiden name as a sort of professional name, but her legal name is her husband's. 5.20.2005 11:08am ( link ) M. Simon ( mail ) ( www ): My first mate let me keep my name. She on the other hand couldn't wait to change hers. Family issues. 5.20.2005 12:57pm ( link ) Karen A. Wyle ( mail ) ( www ): Iam about-to-be-50, and got married at age 34.  Ikept my name for several reasons:  professional license (law), attachment to my family, preservation of my family name, and a husband who couldn't understand why I'd consider changing it.  In spite of all-but-the-last factor, Iwould have considered having us both change to a new name, but my husband had no intention of changing his name. We agreed before we had kids that girls would have my name and boys his.  (My husband got the idea from reading about a tribe somewhere that took this approach.)  As it happened, we had two girls.  My husband doesn't mind -- his family and its name are very widespread, so he didn't feel the need to beget more Hagers. When our first daughter was born, the hospital made him sign a form saying something to the effect of \"Iknow it'll be a hassle if we change our minds later about the baby's last name\".  He was outraged that they would treat the use of the mother's name so differently from the more usual use of the father's name. 5.20.2005 1:32pm ( link ) Elizabeth: Iconsider my name part of who Iam, and to change it after marriage would have been changing who Iam.  My husband actually seemed pleased Iwas keeping my name, Ithink for similar reasons.  The woman he married is the same woman he dated. Any children we have will bear his name.  Not so much because he's the male, but because he's the only son of an only son, whereas Ihave a brother who's children will likely carry my family name.  Besides, his name is much rarer than mine to begin with and it'd be a shame for it to disappear. 5.21.2005 11:55am ( link ) David Has to Add Something Because David's Taken: Imentioned above that I'd changed my name to my wife's name. One additional thought: it has been harder for me to change my name legally than it would've been for my wife. Istill have one credit card with my \"maiden\" name on it (anybody have a good term for that?) because the out-of-state bank (Chase) will not accept a Michigan marriage license as proof of a name change even though Michigan explicitly permits names to be changed either way (or hyphenation, etc.) with no further documentation. Interestingly, Citibank had no problem with it. Perhaps Ishould add that I've been carrying this non-id-matching card for almost ten years now, as our tenth anniversary is next month. Every once in a while Itry to change it. 5.23.2005 1:09am"}]}

The authors intended to develop the\nBelmont report into a book, but did not do so for reasons that remain unknown\nbut should become apparent to the reader upon discovery of the various\nconnections of the JBS founders. Since the John Birch Society successfully\nlaid the foundation for the exploitation of Christians through the ultra-conservative\nmovement, the Belmont Brotherhood is must reading for every Christian: http://watch-unto-prayer.org/belmont.html The passage which intrigued us is found under\nsection #5 -- a profile of former JBS National Councilman, J. Nelson Shepherd,\nwho belonged to the very elite Newcomen Society. This mysterious society\nwas to be exposed by authors of The Belmont Brotherhood in their book which\nnever materialized, and there is scant information available elsewhere.\nThe president of the Newcomen Society for some length of time was Charles\nPenrose, Jr. who was also a member of two high-level, subversive and one-world\nsocieties in the U.S. known as the Pilgrim\nSociety and the English-Speaking Union .  We have already posted\ntwo reports by Eric Samuelson about these societies, which have their origins\nin the Cecil Rhodes-Milner Round Table Group of Great Britain, which purpose\nwas to reestablish the British Commonwealth of Nations and, ultimately,\nto bring the world under the domination of a restored British Empire. What Cecil Rhodes and Alfred Milner had in\nmind was the formation of a master/slave society based upon the principles\nof eugenics as derived from Plato's Republic. Malthusian\nEugenics is the philosophy of depopulation through the reduction of\ninferior races --\"human weeds\"-- and the selective breeding of \"a race\nof thoroughbreds\" as described early in this century by Rockefeller-funded,\nPlanned Parenthood founder, Margaret Sanger. When Thomas Malthus' theory\nof population was later coupled with Charles Darwin's evolutionary model,\nthe result was known as Social Darwinism."}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "The combination of Malthusian population\ncontrol, which included the deliberate\nneglect of populations and indirect methods of killing off population ,\nwith Darwinism, produced National Socialism (Germany), International Socialism\n(Marxist Russia) and International Corporate Capitalism (Global Socialism,\nheadquartered in the United States), and these forms of social conduct\nhave constituted the main reason for the unequal distribution of planetary\nresources, famines, planned biological warefare, environmental poisoning,\nsuppression of knowledge, suppression of inventions, dependence on backward\ntechnology for the population, planned wars to kill off populations and\ngeneral planetary disorder. The problem is in the Social Darwin-Malthus\nparadigm, which has now been combined with the pseudo-sciences of behaviorism\nand genetics in the attempt to assert even tighter control over the planetary\npopulation, yielding forms of Neo-Darwinism being perpetrated by a host\nof post-Atlantean re-treads, per a 1947 Princeton consensus."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Malthusian eugenics has long captivated the imaginations\nof the very elite who control the world's wealth and power structures.\nNearly two centuries of applied principles of Social Darwinism have positioned\nthe world whereby the empowered elite classes may govern the slave race\nthey create to labor under their monopolist capitalist rule. Since the\nOrders of Freemasonry largely comprise the ruling elite which owns the\ntransnational corporations, a Masonic history of The\nRound Table is instructive:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Throughout most the ninetieth century,\nFrench Freemasonry, and not English Freemasonry, was the dominant revolutionary\nforce in the Old World - offering the lower and middle classes a voice\nin government. Since its beginning in 1717, the British Brotherhood was\naristocratic, capitalist, and monopolistic. When French Grand Orient Freemasonry\nsent a German-born Mason, Karl Marx (1818 - 1883) to England to agitate\nthe lower classes to rebel against the British aristocracy, the British\naristocracy became concerned. To counter the increasingly influential ideology\nof French Freemasonry, in 1870 a select group of English Masonry devised\na plan which would both satisfy the proletariat and keep the Masonic oligarchy\nin power. The scheme was introduced at Oxford, by Freemason John Ruskin. Ruskin's inspiration and devotion\nto the creation of an elite of race patriots derived directly from Plato's\nRepublic. In the Republic, Plato called for \"a ruling class with a powerful\narmy to keep it in power and a society completely subordinate to the monolithic\nauthority of the rulers.\" Ruskin sent out to recoup and extend the influence\nof British Masonry. He wanted to do this by education of the working man.\nHis views on the ruling class as developed from Plato's Republic, sent\nshock waves through Oxford. \"[You, the undergraduates are] the\npossessors of a magnificent tradition of education, beauty, rule of law,\nfreedom, decency and self-discipline but... this tradition [can] not be\nsaved, and does not deserve to be saved, unless it can be extended to the\nlower classes in England itself and to the non-English masses throughout\nthe world. If this precious tradition is not extended to these two great\nmajorities, the minority of upper-class Englishmen will ultimately be submerged\nby these majorities and the tradition lost. To prevent this, the tradition\nmust be extended to the masses and to the empire.\" Ruskin's rationale for proclaiming\nsuch ideas was to plant in the fertile minds of his Oxford students the\ntheory that if they educated the working man and elevated him to the middle\nclass, he would labor in behalf of the aristocracy to perpetuate the tradition\nof the upper-class Englishmen - which tradition was to control the finances\nof nations through ground rent, banking and trade. Ruskin taught that it\nwas the essential duty of the aristocracy to guarantee an education for\nthe so that an expanded middle class would rule the country. This arrangement\nwould be a type of legal slavery whereby both classes would benefit. Through\nthe power of finance, the ruling class would maintain control from behind\nthe scenes, while the working class would have opportunity to share in\nthe common wealth made available through loans. Ruskin successfully transmitted his\nvision\nto his students at Oxford. They in turn became the Masonic movers and shakers\nin the new politics and economics that today govern the seven industrial\nnations of the world - the United States, Canada, England, Germany, France,\nItaly, and Japan. Awealthy young man, Cecil Rhodes,\nlike John Ruskin believed that only the British elite could and should\nrule the world to the benefit and happiness of mankind. Shortly after arriving\nat Oxford, Rhodes was initiated into Freemasonry at the Apollo University\nlodge No. 357. On April 17, 1877, he was raised a Master Mason in the same\nlodge. Rhodes also joined a Scottish Rite Lodge at Oxford called Prince\nRose Croix Lodge No. 30. What sort of character was Cecil\nRhodes? Rhodes was a critic of English Freemasonry - of its impotence and\nincompetence in advancing British race interest. After being raised to\nMaster Mason on April 17, 1877, Rhodes drafted a program for world dominion\nby the British race patriots. To guarantee the funding from his vast wealth\nof his world vision for the British empire, Rhodes wrote in 1877 the first\nof seven wills that he composed over his lifetime. The first will called\nfor the formation of a \"secret society\" whose primary function would be\nfocused on returning England to her former glory. He viewed English Freemasonry\nand its conspiracy as impotent and in effect defunct in this regard. Ironically,\nwhen the society Rhodes had envisioned was finally organized after his\ndeath, its membership consisted only of English Freemasons. \"The Round\nTable,\" as it was known, soon became the most powerful appendage of the\nBritish Brotherhood. In his third will Rhodes left his\nentire estate to Freemason Lord Nathan Rothschild as trustee. Rhodes stipulated\nthat his gigantic fortune be used by his disciples to carry out the program\nhe envisioned. Rothschild appointed Freemason Alfred Milner to head up\nthe Secret society for which Rhodes's first will made provision. Lord Milner\nonce remarked of himself, \"My patriotism knows no geographical but only\nracial limits. Iam a British Race patriot.\" Upon his appointment by Rothschild\nto chair Rhodes's secret society, Milner recruited a group of young men\nfrom Oxford and Tonybee Hall to assist him in organizing his administration\nof the new society. All were respected English Freemasons. Among them were\nRudyard Kipling, Arthur Balfour, Lord Rothschild, and some Oxford College\ngraduates known as \"Milner's Kindergarten.\" In 1909, Milner's Kindergarten,\nwith some other English Masons, founded the Round Table. The grandfather\nof all modern British Masonic \"think tanks\" was born. Three powerful think tank offshoots\nof the Round Table are (1) the Royal Institute of International Affairs\n(RIIA), organized in 1919 in London; (2) the Council on Foreign Relations\n(CFR), organized in 1921 in New York City; and (3) the Institute of Pacific\nRelations (IPR), organized in 1925 or the twelve countries holding territory\nin what today we call the Pacific Rim. The initial assignment of the Round\nTable was not necessarily to destroy the political experiments of French\nFreemasonry, such as socialism and communism, but to cooperate with them\nfor the advancement of the English Masonic conspiracy. Some seven years before the organization\nof the Round Table, of which H.G. Wells would be a founding member, Wells\nexplained the strategy by which aristocratic English Freemasonry would\nreach its goal of world dominion. He called it an \"Open Conspiracy\" as\nopposed to French Freemasonry's closed or secret conspiracy. \"The Open Conspiracy will appear\nfirst, Ibelieve, as a conscious organization of intelligent and quite\npossibly in some cases wealthy men, as a movement having distinct social\nand political aims . . .\""}, {"tag": "div", "text": "H.G.

According to a series of articles in the Chicago Tribune\nin 1951, there was a time, prior to the Cold War, when a measure of concern\nwas growing over the shadow cast upon the American government by the British\nRhodes-Milner Round Table.

{"file_number": "194", "plaintext": [{"tag": "p", "text": "Statement of Stuart K. Pratt, Consumer Data Industry Association The Consumer Data \nIndustry Association (CDIA) is pleased to submit written testimony in connection \nwith a hearing on the misuse of Social Security numbers and we thank Chairman \nShaw for holding this hearing. CDIA has appeared in person before this \nsubcommittee before and we hope our testimony will be helpful to you. [1] Founded in 1906, \nthe Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), formerly known as Associated \nCredit Bureaus, is the international trade association that represents more than \n500 consumer data companies. CDIA members represent the nations leading \ninstitutions in credit reporting, mortgage reporting, check verification, fraud \nprevention, risk management, employment reporting, tenant screening and \ncollection services. Consumer reporting \nagencies are careful stewards of personal information and they adhere to strict \nprocedures outlined in federal and state laws. [2] The information infrastructure of the consumer reporting system is the backbone \nof the consumer credit economy. [3] Our members have a \nstrong interest in the legitimate and lawful use of all information, including \nSocial Security numbers. Used properly, SSNs play a substantial role in \nreducing fraud, enhancing workplace security, promoting public safety, \nsupporting homeland defense, reducing state and federal entitlement fraud, \nenhancing child support enforcement, and facilitating commerce to a diverse, \nmobile electronic society. Before Ispecifically address how the SSN is used by our industry and the importance of \nthis number, Ihave found it helpful to provide a short review of what a \nconsumer reporting agency is, what is contained in a consumer report, and the \nlaw that governs our industry. CONSUMER \nREPORTING AGENCIES AND CONSUMER REPORTS Consumer reporting \nagencies maintain information on individual consumer payment patterns associated \nwith various types of credit obligations on approximately 190 million \nAmericans. The data compiled by these agencies is used by creditors and others \npermitted under the strict prescriptions of the FCRA. Consumer credit \nhistories are derived from, among other sources, the voluntary provision of \ninformation about consumer payments on various types of credit accounts or other \ndebts from thousands of data furnishers such as credit grantors, student loan \nguarantee and child support enforcement agencies. Aconsumer's file may also \ninclude public record items such as a bankruptcy filing, judgment or lien. Note \nthat these types of data sources often contain SSNs, as well. For purposes of \ndata accuracy and proper identification, generally our members maintain \ninformation such as a consumer's full name, current and previous addresses, \nSocial Security Number (when voluntarily provided by consumers) and places of \nemployment. This data is loaded into the system on a regular basis to ensure the \ncompleteness and accuracy of data. [4] It is interesting \nto note that the vast majority of data in our members' systems simply confirms \nwhat most of you would expect; that consumers pay their bills on time and are \nresponsible, good credit risks. This contrasts with the majority of systems \nmaintained in other countries, such as Japan or Italy, which store only negative \ndata and do not give consumers recognition for the responsible management of \ntheir finances. As important as \nknowing what we have in our files is also knowing what types of information our \nmembers do not maintain in files used to produce consumer reports. Our \nmembers do not know what consumers have purchased using credit (e.g., a \nrefrigerator, clothing, etc.) or where they used a particular bank card \n(e.g., which stores a consumer frequents). They also don't have a record of when consumers have been declined for credit or another benefit based on the \nuse of a consumer report. Medical treatment data isn't a part of the databases \nand no bank account information is available in a consumer report. THE FAIR CREDIT \nREPORTING ACT (FCRA) In addition to our general discussion of the industry, we believe it is \nimportant for your Subcommittee to have a baseline understanding of the law \nwhich regulates our industry. Enacted in 1970, \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act was significantly amended in the 104th Congress \nwith the passage of the Credit Reporting Reform Act. Congress, our \nAssociation's members, creditors and consumer groups spent over six years \nworking through the modernization of what was the first privacy law enacted in \nthis country (1970). This amendatory process resulted in a complete, current and \nforwarding-looking statute. The FCRA serves as an example of successfully \nbalancing the rights of the individual with the economic benefits of maintaining \na competitive consumer reporting system so necessary to a market-oriented \neconomy. The FCRA is an \neffective privacy statute, which protects the consumer by narrowly limiting the \nappropriate uses of a consumer report (often we call this a credit report) under \nSection 604 (15 U.S.C. 1681b), entitled Permissible Purposes of Reports. Some of the more \ncommon uses of a consumer's file are in the issuance of credit, subsequent \naccount review and collection processes. Reports are also, for example, \npermitted to be used by child support enforcement agencies when establishing \nlevels of support. Beyond protecting \nthe privacy of the information contained in consumer reports, the FCRA also \nprovides consumers with certain rights such as the right of access; the right to \ndispute any inaccurate information and have it corrected or removed; and the \nright to prosecute any person who accesses their information for an \nimpermissible purpose. The law also includes a shared liability for data \naccuracy between consumer reporting agencies and furnishers of information to \nthe system. SOCIAL SECURITY \nNUMBER USES Let me now turn to \nthe question of how our industry uses the SSN. Under the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, our industry has a duty to employ reasonable procedures \nto ensure the maximum possible accuracy of the consumer report. Further, we \nmust design systems that accurately allow our customers to extract only the data requested on a specific individual. We must accomplish \nthis dual mission of accuracy both in terms of building databases, but also \nproperly identifying files in our systems in the context of a highly mobile \nsociety. Consider the following:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Approximately 16% of the nation's population moves \neach year according to the U.S. Census Bureau, which means many addresses change \neach year. (This equates to approximately 42 million Americans) Based on National Center for Health Statistics, it \nis estimated that there are 2.4 million marriages and 1.2 million divorces \nannually. This event frequently triggers changes in addresses as well as last \nnames. In 1998 there were 6 million homes in the U.S. that are considered \n  vacation or second homes. Consumers often switch billing addresses if \n  they stay at such residences for long periods of time and in some cases \n  maintain billing addresses for both residences with various creditors. \n  (Source: U.S. Census Bureau House Vacancy Survey as extrapolated by the \n  National Association of Realtors)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "These data clearly \nspeak to the challenge our members face where identifying data often changes. In light of the \nmobility of our society, the Social Security Number plays a very significant \nrole in ensuring data quality. Our members process 2 billion data elements a \nmonth. These elements are a combination of credit history data and identifying \ninformation. Consider the following very real example. Where a consumer \nhas changed a last name due to marriage or divorce and has moved to a new \naddress, which is common in either case, the SSN is the most stable identifying \nelement in the file. First, it helps us to identify the consumer's file with \nprecision during this life transition where he or she is likely applying for new \ncredit, seeking approval for utilities, and seeking to rent or purchase a new \nresidence. The consumer expects that the consumer report will be available for \nall of these necessary transactions and the SSN helps our members to meet this \nexpectation. Second, the consumer expect his or her file to be accurate and the \nSSN helps us to maintain the file accurately even when the consumer is in the \nmidst of updating creditors with changes in name and address. The SSN is also a \ncritical element in producing information products, which are commonly called \nlocator services. These services are made available, for example, to child \nsupport enforcement agencies for purposes of locating non-custodial parents; [5] to pension funds which must locate beneficiaries; to law enforcement for \nlocating criminals or witnesses; [6] to healthcare providers that must locate individuals who have chosen not to pay \ntheir bills, to state benefits agencies to reduce public assistance fraud, [7] and for other similar uses. Further, the SSN \nplays a role in fraud prevention products. Where a consumer makes application \nfor a product or service, information products that help the business to ensure \nthat they are doing business with the right consumer use information products to \nauthenticate or verify the application information. This is true in both for \nbricks-and-mortar business and in e-Commerce. If applicant data \ndoes not match, then the business can take additional steps to verify the \nconsumer's identity and thus prevent fraud. FRAUD \nPREVENTION AND IDENTITY THEFT In your press \nrelease announcing this hearing, you mention the potential for misuse of the SSN. \nOur industry has a history of bringing forward initiatives to address fraud. \nThese efforts focus on the use of new technologies, and better procedures and \neducation. CDIA and its members have a long history of being leading innovators \nof identity fraud solutions. The attachment provides a short thumbnail of our \ninvolvement in identity fraud remediation since 1993. [8] CONCLUSION In conclusion, you \ncan see by our actions that in large part our uses of the SSN are governed under \nthe Fair Credit Reporting Act, one of the most extensive privacy laws in the \ncountry. Beyond law, our members have a history of proactively limiting how \nSSNs are used outside of the FCRA. No one particular element of information is \nthe key to identity theft. The underlying theme in all of this is balance. Laws that \noverreach in attempting to limit use of the SSN are likely to merely take fraud \nprevention tools out of the hands of legitimate businesses at the expense of \nconsumers. Ironically, to prevent fraud you must be able to crosscheck \ninformation. To maintain accurate databases, you must be able to maintain a \nrange of identifying elements. Absent the availability of the SSN, we will be \nless able to build accurate data bases, to accurately identify records and to \nhelp prevent the very crime through the development of fraud prevention and \nauthentication tools. Thank you for this \nopportunity to offer testimony. CDIA is available to assist your and your \ncommittee at any time.

[2] All consumer reporting \n    agencies are bound by the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C.  1681 et seq . and numerous state credit reporting laws. Among other \n    things, the FCRA requires consumer reporting agencies to maintain reasonable \n    procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy, 15 U.S.C.  1681e(b) and \n    prohibits data furnishers from furnishing data to consumer reporting \n    agencies if they know the information has an error,  1681s-2(a). In \n    addition, a consumer reporting agency is prohibited from furnishing a \n    consumer report to anyone without a permissible purpose - a narrow and \n    statutorily limited list of permitted uses.  1681b. [3] For example, it was recently \n    noted that Maintaining a reliable and \n    robust national credit reporting system is essential to ensure the continued \n    availability of consumer credit at reasonable costs * * * The ready \n    availability of accurate, up-to-date credit information from consumer \n    reporting agencies benefits both creditors and consumers. Information from \n    consumer reports gives creditors the ability to make credit decisions \n    quickly and in a fair, safe and sound, and cost-effective manner. Consumers \n    benefit from access to credit information from different sources, vigorous \n    competition among creditors, quick decisions on credit applications, and \n    reasonable costs for credit.

More than 30 student, faculty and staff volunteers from St. Lawrence University \n    spent part of the semester break assisting with recovery and cleanup efforts \n    at \"Ground Zero,\" the site of the September 11 collapse of the World \n    Trade Center's twin towers in New York City. From January 6 through 12, members \n    of the group worked at two locations near the site: the coroner's office on 1st Ave., where rescue workers may bring the remains \n    of someone who, through DNA tests, has been identified as missing; and \"Ground \n    Zero\" itself, where a tent has been set up for volunteers to report for \n    assignments from coordinators working with the Salvation Army. Depending upon \n    those assignments, volunteers are dispatched to various sites where workers \n    are most needed, during the 3 to 11 p.m. shift. St. Lawrence volunteers have \n    been provided free lodging at a nearby YMCA facility. The project originated \n    at a North Country Scholar Day admissions event in November; attendees included \n    Disaster Relief Project Director for the Salvation Army Randy Widrick, a Colton, \n    New York, resident who has been in New York City since September 13. On-campus \n    coordination was done by St. Lawrence Leadership Academy Project Director Anne Townsend .

Town and Gown St. Lawrence has formally requested that the Village of Canton annex four \n    University-owned properties on the north side of East Main Street, making \n    them part of the village. All are now part of the Town of Canton. In a letter \n    to Canton Mayor Robert Wells, Vice President for Administrative Operations \n    Thomas Coakley stated, \"Adding these properties would appropriately add \n    to the tax base of the Village and that is, in fact, our objective in making \n    this request.\" Should the request be granted, the University will also request a zoning change \n    for the parcels, from their present Town of Canton designation as commercial, \n    to the village's \"highest permissible residential zoning.\" Coakley \n    pointed out in the letter that the properties in question all have deed restrictions \n    that limit their use to residential purposes. The University has also requested that four additional properties be removed \n    from tax rolls, and be designated as tax-exempt properties. They are: 21 Elm Street - Viebranz Scholar residence 7 Maple Street - Safety and Security Officer 11 Maple Street - Office for Corporate and Foundation Relations 127 Miner Street - To be a vacant lot \"These are properties that we utilize more directly in the operation \n    of the University,\" Coakley's letter states. Town Supervisor David Button has referred the request to Town Attorney Charles \n    Nash, who plans to report to the town board in February with a recommendation.

Results: We had limited success with this run, primarily due to poor machine conditions. This was probably a result of the recent vent, combined with the fact that we were running non-standard shapes, and thus putting power on different vessel surfaces.  This led to impurity injections and, most critically, to a high hydrogen fraction (up to 20%) which limited the RF power absorption; H/Dtypically increases during each discharge, with Pabs decreasing. The shape development part of the run went quite smoothly, and we did get shots which were a very close match to ASDEX Upgrade shapes (see physics operator summary for details of changes made).  These had elongation close to our vertical stability limits (k~1.73), and were close to double null, which may have caused some interaction with upper vessel surfaces, and possibly also increased H-mode thresholds.  The last AUG shaped shot, 1010719020, is a good example  (Delta_u=0.34, delta_l= 0.47) J-port was not available for the run after all, so we ran with typically 2.3 MW at 80 MHz from Dand Eport antennas.  However, the low absorption means that the effective power was actually much lower, especially late in the pulse. We were unable to get any H-modes which had a steady, EDA character.  Many were ELM-free, with strongly increasing impurities.  (eg. shot 2, 14).  Others, with lower power and higher radiation, had periodic behaviour typical of Type III ELMs; the pedestal was very cold (eg. shots 5,13).  On shots 9 and 11 we ramped the RF up slowly to get threshold data, and found it was over the 2.3 MW injected); this is very high for these C-Mod conditions.  Making the discharge more 'single null' had little effect (shot 12).  Lowering the target density from nel= 0.9 to 0.7e20 m-2, while it had minimal effect on nebar at the RF onset (1.35-1.4e20m-3 in both cases), resulted in much lower neutral pressure anda threshold of Prf=1.13 MW (shot 13).  This may be a good point for threshold comparison, though it was rather early in the ramp. Shot 14 had full RF power at this density, and resulted in ELM-free H-modes. In an attempts to favour the EDA regime, Ip was lowered from 1.0 to 0.9 MA from shot 15 on.  This raised q95 to 4.2.  The rates of density rise did decrease slightly, though not an obvious EDA regime.  Shot 16 had hints of a weak quasi-coherent mode on PCI.  Shot 17 was colder and more ELMy.  From shot 19 Bt was raised from 5.3 Tto 5.6 T, raising q95 still further and a better match to the AUG target.  This proved more difficult for the RF to match, for reasons not well understood at least by me, and power was not as steady as the rest of the day. The density did appear to be getting more steady, and QC modes characteristic of EDA were seen on PCI.  Shot 21, about 0.75-0.8 secs, may be a good time for pedestal analysis.  For shot 22, we went back to a standard shape, 800 kA shot to check we could get EDA there.  We did, but it quickly cooled and reverted to Type III ELMs as H/Drose. In summary, as expected, it was more difficult to get steady H-modes in the lower triangularity ASDEX-Upgrade shape.  However, the poor machine conditions and low absorbed power undoubtedly were a major impediment, and there were indications we were getting close.  There was insufficient power to try raising the density.  Since the discharge development has been successfully completed, we would very much like to revisit this experiment on a day with better vessel conditions and all three RF antennas available.

Summary _______ Shapes that are an excellent match to the scaled AUG shape were obtained (e.g. 21) and many were run. Acomparison plot is in user10:[hutch.ps]aug_match.ps. They are close to double null; although a range of three sseps was run without obvious effect on the plasma character. No solid EDA H-modes were obtained. The H/Dwas high and rose strongly with RF in the early part of the day. Later on, the rises seemed less significant, but in all cases the H/Dwas above 10% during much of the RF pulse. Heating was clearly inefficient in many cases. In some others heating was ok even at high H/D. The early part of the day was plagued with injections. Many appeared to be caused by visible sparks on the upper left corner of D-antenna. Some others were not RF induced. As the day wore on, these problems were less severe, and the plasma ran reasonably reliably. These shapes are fairly close to stability limits. One or two VDEs were experienced. The chopper Vwas set to 150 to 200 instead of the usual 0 to lower the operating average current to a position closer to the center of its range. This adjustment seemed to be a significant improvement in that it allowed operation with an elongation that gave rise to noisy chopper behaviour without leading to saturations and subsequent VDE. Amanual gas puff during the RF did not significantly improve the operation, but also did not seem to give much impact on the RF coupling despite a x2 rise in main chamber neutral pressure. It appears to be confirmed that the lower triangularity that is needed to match AUG makes it harder to get into EDA. The high Hlevel was also definitely a handicap.

{"file_number": "199", "plaintext": [{"tag": "div", "text": "Français - Español « Features service articles 7th European Regional Meeting in Budapest Balancing flexibility, stability and security in European labour markets Policymakers all over Europe are facing the crucial challenge of regulating a rapidly evolving labour market in the context of the globalized economy. Will they listen to calls made for greater flexibility to overcome what have often been characterized as the region's labour market rigidities: employment protection and legislation, union bargaining power, generous welfare systems and high labour taxation? Or can they place their trust in a \"flexicurity\" model: new ways of balancing flexibility and security in relation to employment, income and social protection? \"Flexicurity\" is one of the main issues to be discussed at the forthcoming European Regional Meeting of the ILO in Budapest on 14 to 18 February ( Note 1 ). ILO Online spoke with ILO employment experts Sandrine Cazes, Alena Nesporova and Peter Auer. ILO online: Has employment become more flexible in Europe? Sandrine Cazes: Research by the ILO and others refutes the claim that, as labour markets become more flexible, stable jobs are becoming a thing of the past, at least in Western Europe. The employment relationship is more stable than is commonly assumed in the industrialized world. Indeed, job stability, as measured by average job tenure and reflected in the figures for European countries as a whole, has hardly changed in recent years, despite the large differences between these countries and the persistent segmentation between well-protected core groups of workers in permanent employment and those in flexible forms of employment who enjoy less protection. Some of the larger countries, such as Germany and Italy, have experienced a growth of more flexible forms of employment, while in France, Spain and the United Kingdom the growth of flexibility has been outpaced by the growth of \"standard\" forms of employment. ILO online: Does flexibility pay? Peter Auer: Analysis of the situation in Western European countries shows that, while they still have a relatively high level of stable jobs, job tenure is not necessarily synonymous with a perceived sense of employment security. Indeed, many of the countries with the longest average job tenure are not those with the best results in terms of decent work, which combines elements such as good wages, perceived job security and participation in training. These countries, including France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Spain, appear to have lower employment rates than the more \"flexible\" countries, such as Denmark, Finland and the Netherlands. While this may stem from many factors, including women's employment rates and the sectoral distribution of employment, flexibility also plays a role. The interesting fact emerges that a number of countries in Western Europe have achieved a high quantity of jobs without sacrificing job quality. These countries have the highest employment rates (including youth employment), low unemployment, high rates of participation by women in the labour market, a good record in relation to the transformation of temporary jobs into permanent ones, and among the best records of job quality and perceived security. Flexible countries have high employment rates for youth as well as a high rate of transformation of temporary jobs into permanent jobs. Over a period of three years, around 65 per cent of temporary jobs in Denmark and 55 per cent in the Netherlands were transformed into permanent jobs. ILO online: Does employment stability pay? Peter Auer: It is often overlooked that a certain degree of stability in labour markets, that means a certain amount of long-term jobs, is good for productivity and is also at the base of workers' security. However, it would appear that, if workers have the confidence to leave their jobs and benefit from a high level of protection during their transition to another job, they feel less \"locked in\" in jobs and have greater choice of employment, which in turn leads to better matching of labour supply and demand. It follows that more than just job stability is needed to achieve good employment quality and quantity, but that job stability should be at the base of all employment systems. It is thus likely that a reasonable combination of longer and shorter term jobs, combined\nwith labour market institutions which provide income, social and employability protection during transitions, creates a greater sense of labour market security than stable jobs in an uncertain environment. ILO online: Does this also apply to countries in central and Eastern Europe? Alena Nesporova: By contrast, the central and Eastern European countries have experienced strong movements in their labour markets owing to the accelerated pace of job destruction in the wake of transition and the limited scope of job creation in the formal economy. While the share of traditional forms of flexible employment, such as fixed-term and part-time jobs, and even self-employment (after an initial increase), has remained fairly stable, there has been a rise in employment based on non-labour contracts or work performed without a contract. While the use of fixed-term contracts has increased in the majority of these countries, their share is still much lower than in EU countries - well below 10 per cent of total employment. Average job tenure in central and Eastern European countries is quite low when compared with some Western European countries. Nevertheless, these forms of labour market flexibility have not, in general, served to improve mobility in the formal labour market. An acute perception of job insecurity, in a context of generally weak labour demand and unemployment protection, appears to be making workers hesitant to leave less productive jobs voluntarily and move on to more productive ones. This may have important negative effects on productivity developments. Moreover, Hungary and Poland, the two countries which have progressed furthest in deregulation, are also among those with the lowest labour force participation and employment rates in the 25 member States of the EU. This shows that deregulation is not the solution for poor employment performance. ILO online: To what extent are the social partners involved in labour market reform at the national level? Sandrine Cazes: The main point is that labour market institutions and policies really do matter. All labour market indicators appear to be affected positively by active labour market policies and a greater intensity of collective bargaining. Policies to stimulate employment promotion and reduce unemployment, rather than pure deregulation, should clearly be on the agenda of the former transition countries, with the aim of protecting transition to new jobs. Of course, there is no single optimal institutional setting for any specific country, since all countries differ in terms of national experience, culture and circumstances. Each country must therefore consider a wide choice of policy options for creating labour markets which offer both flexibility and security. In this respect, social dialogue is undoubtedly the best tool for testing the acceptability and efficiency of the proposed changes and securing broad support for them. ILO online: Should governments' labour market and social policies focus on work rather than welfare? Peter Auer: If a system for ensuring labour market security in transition between jobs is to be sustained, high employment rates are needed, and the system must be based on work rather than welfare. Such a system is not without costs, and places a premium on individual responsibility, such as the obligation to participate in activation measures, which have slowly become standard in many parts of Europe. But if the public benefits of such a system of \"protected flexibility\" are widely shared, the costs would appear to be acceptable. ILO online: What action can the ILO take to further promote the concept of \"flexicurity\" at the national and regional levels? Alena Nesporova: \"Flexicurity\" requires, but also promotes, high employment rates. Without competitive enterprises which are able to adjust their workforces to market conditions, employment performance will be poor. However, as already explained, high levels of labour market flexibility per se cannot solve the unemployment problem, unless workers enjoy sufficient employment and income security, through intensive re-employment assistance, active labour market programmes and income support, to motivate them to accept higher mobility and flexibility, and facilitate their adaptation. Dialogue between governments, workers and employers on policy choices is the foundation of the \"flexicurity\" approach. The ILO \"flexicurity\" project covering Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Lithuania and Poland, puts this approach into practice and illustrates the different policy responses of the central and Eastern European countries to employment challenges.

Benedict at a meeting with concerned Senior House residents. “There will be none of these people living at Senior House next year,” Benedict said at the Friday afternoon meeting amidst cheers from the audience. The coordinator slated to be housed in Senior House will instead live at Eastgate. Assistant Dean for Residential Programs Katherine G. O’Dair said that it was impossible to house a residential coordinator in Senior House because the the space for the coordinator had already been promised to a handicapped student. Coordinators will also live in Next House and NW30, the new dormitory for graduate students which will open in Fall 2001. Burton-Conner was also mentioned as a possible home for a residential coordinator. However, Burton-Conner president Kiwah K. Kendrick ’02 said that the dormitory was unlikely to accept the proposal in its current state. Benedict and O’Dair will meet with Burton-Conner tomorrow. The Friday meeting was organized to deal with the negative student response to the residential coordinator proposal, which the deans announced earlier this month. About 75 students joined Benedict, O’Dair, Senior House Housemaster Henry Jenkins, and Director of Housing Operations Karen A. Nilsson for the discussion. DSL will rewrite job description Benedict and O’Dair also agreed  to rewrite the job description for residential coordinators. “The language [in the original proposal] was atrocious,” Benedict said. O’Dair added that coordinators would not be granted any disciplinary or judicial power. Under the new proposal, residential coordinators will serve both graduate students and undergraduates, O’Dair said. The original plan included one coordinator for all graduate students and three for the undergraduates. Deans address communication After announcing the new residential coordinator plans, Benedict and O’Dair addressed student complaints about ineffective communication between students and the administration. Dormitory Council President Jeffrey C. Roberts ’02 said he had known about the proposal as early as December. Dormcon didn’t inform the public of the status of the proposal because it felt it did not have enough details to advertise, said Dormcon Vice President Matthew S. Cain ’02. “It was basically a big miscommunication,” Cain said. Roberts added that when he was first informed, the proposal “was not a plan ... my expectation was that when it became a plan, [the dormitories involved] would be be the first to hear. We just had a breakdown in communication.” The administration had also communicated with the Undergraduate Association and the Graduate Student Council, O’Dair said. “One thing we’ve learned is that we need to use multiple communication mechanisms, because as it is, the word doesn’t get out,” O’Dair said. Students prefer new proposal Most attendees at Friday’s meeting acknowledged that Benedict’s new proposal was an improvement. Robin H. Ivester ’01, who wrote the summary of student concerns provided to Benedict on Friday, said that Benedict’s appearance at the meeting helped rebuild students’ trust in the administration. “Ithink what he did shows us very clearly that he’s willing to work with us, for us,” she said. Other students commended the administration for responding to their concerns. “Iwas pretty pleased with the outcome of the meeting,” said Senior House resident M. Maitland Lederer ’03. “Iwas glad to see communication [between students and administrators] and not just yelling and name-calling.” Lederer added that residential coordinators were “not a bad idea in principle” and that her main objections to the initial proposal were the original implementation plans and the wording. “It’s clear that Dean Benedict cares about the well-being of the students,” said Senior House resident Geoffrey L. Goodell ’01. However, Goodell expressed reservations about the administration’s failure to provide students with a long-term plan. He added that, without seeing Benedict’s long-term vision, the residential coordinator plan seems “like a solution begging for a problem.” Meanwhile, the GSC expressed its support for the new proposal. “Among grad students, we like the concept of having another person to help with residential life,” said GSC Housing and Community Affairs Chair Shunmugavelu D. Sokka. “Undergraduates have a lot of support already, but we favor any help we can get.” Students draft bill of rights The controversy surrounding this proposal has inspired a group of students, led by Lederer, to create a “Students’ Bill of Rights.” Currently in its early stages, the document outlines students’ basic housing rights. Lederer said the idea had been tossed around by the UA and other groups. “It’s not incredibly novel, but it’s something that hasn’t been done yet,” she said.
