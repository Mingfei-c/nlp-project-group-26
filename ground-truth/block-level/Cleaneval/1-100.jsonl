{"file_number": "10", "plaintext": [{"tag": "h1", "text": "Some VERY interesting information on 666"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "by Ragnar Redbeard"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "From: \"Ragnar Redbeard\" It has been suggested in this newsgroup (alt.christianity) in response to my \r\n  question regarding the origin of 666 that the number 666 has its roots in numerology. \r\n  This is the school of thought that agree with. The number 666 has its origins \r\n  in ancient numerology / astrology, and is connected to what are called \"magic \r\n  squares\". The ancients devised a scheme of numbers arranged in squares and ordered \r\n  in such a way that by adding each row and column, one would reach the same total \r\n  each time. 666 comes from the square associated with the Sun, which is made \r\n  up of every number from 1 to 36. The sum of all numbers from 1 to 36 is of course, \r\n  666. Surrounding the Sun Square are the 12 divisibles of 666 which are attached \r\n  to the 12 signs of the Zodiac. 666 = Pisces 333 = Aquarius 222 = Capricorn 111 = Sagitaurus 74 = Scorpio 37 = Libra 18 = Virgo 9 = Leo 6 = Cancer 3 = Gemini 2 = Taurus 1 = Aries Here is what the Sun Square looks like: 6 32 3 34 35 1 7 11 27 28 8 30 19 14 16 15 23 24 18 20 22 21 17 13 25 29 10 9 26 12 36 5 33 4 2 31 The factors of 666 are 666, 333, 222, 111, 74, 37, 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, and 1. They \r\n  are attached to the Zodiac signs as follows: So, each of the six rows has a total of 111 (6 rows x 111 = 666). Each of \r\n  the 6 columns also has a total of 111. The Sun Square contains 9 squares and rectangles whose corners total 74 ( 9 \r\n  X 74 = 666 ) One example is \"6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74\" For those who practiced numerology / astrology, the numbers 666 and 74 were \r\n  considered 'holy' numbers, associated with the Sun, which they revered. Numerology \r\n  / Astrology (from now on referred to as Hermetica) also became a recurring phenomenon \r\n  in the bible, particularely the KJV. Many of the numbers which are sacred to \r\n  Hermetica are found to be recurring throughout the KJV, 666 being the most obvious. The famous reference to 666 is found in revelation, but another exists in 1 \r\n  Kings 10:14 where Solomon takes 666 talents of gold from neighboring kingdoms. \r\n  Solomon is one of the more important examples of this biblically coded wisdom. Solomon is basically the figure head of the 12 tribes of Israel during his \r\n  reign as king. Solomon represents the Sun and the Sun Square and the 12 tribes \r\n  of Israel are the 12 signs of the Zodiac. The 666 clue found in 1 Kings is one \r\n  hint - another is the name Solomon. \"Sol\" is the Latin word for the Sun, \"Om\" \r\n  is the Hindi word for the Sun, and \"On\" is the Egyptian word for the Sun. While 666 is the most famous reference to the practice of Numerology found \r\n  in the bible, there are many others which are more subtle. First a quick point \r\n  regarding history: In approximately 325 A.D. Emperor Constantine declared Christianity to be the \r\n  official religion of the Roman Empire. His reasons are the topic of another \r\n  discussion, but for better or worse it is a fact. For the next 1500 years, all \r\n  other religions or philosophies were ruthlessly purged from the Roman Empire, \r\n  to the point of knowledge of many ancient religions becoming extinct. The Ancients, \r\n  realizing that practicing Hermetica (Numerology / Astrology) meant a visit to \r\n  the torture chamber, did what anyone in their position would do - they hid their \r\n  knowledge. The were fortunate in the fact that they were practically the only \r\n  ones with any sort of education, and thus were trusted to read, write, and interpret \r\n  for Rome. Fast forward to somewhere in the 1600's when King James decided that \r\n  the bible should be available in English and commissioned a group of scholars \r\n  including Francis Bacon* to oversee the translation of the bible from Hebrew \r\n  & Latin to English. Francis Bacon was a member of the chain of minds that \r\n  sprang from the Ancient Philosophers and he constructed the KJV in such a way \r\n  that the knowledge they possessed may be preserved. All one has to do is decipher \r\n  it. Now, with that in mind, we can look at the bible and understand why it is arranged \r\n  the way it is. If someone was to write a code without leaving any sort of decoding \r\n  manual, it stands to reason that the means of decoding his work would have to \r\n  be included in his work. The first step to deciphering this code would be to \r\n  look for extremes. Take for example, Psalm 117. It sits at the exact center \r\n  of the bible (in traditional order) and is the shortest chapter in the bible. \r\n  As such, it almost jumps out and screams \"Hey, look at me!\" Psalms 117 has exactly \r\n  33 words. By no coincidence there are 33 years in the life of Christ, and 33 \r\n  generations from Adam to David. *There are those who believe that it was Francis Bacon who wrote the works \r\n  attributed to Shakespeare. Here is a little tidbit suggestive of this theory. \r\n  Count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible. You will find that it \r\n  is Psalm 46. Count 46 words into that chapter and find that the 46th word is \r\n  \"Shake\". Count 46 words backwards from the end of that chapter and find that \r\n  the 46th word is \"spear\". The mathematical laws of probability eliminate the \r\n  \"coincidence\" theory, and we conclude that with this method of \"counting the \r\n  bible\" rather than reading the bible we are on the right track. Due to a period of over one thousand years in which anything other than Church \r\n  approved subject matter was relentlessly purged, intimate knowledge of pre-Christian \r\n  religious practices (particularely those related to Numerology) is scarce. Some \r\n  rudimentary information still remains, such as the names and fables associated \r\n  with the Pagan lore, along with some fundamental Numerology / Astrology concepts. \r\n  Many are familiar with the tales of Thor, Odin (Wotan, Woden), Zues, and the \r\n  whole pantheon of gods and goddesses. The horoscopic information that exists \r\n  in today's New Age circles consists mainly of simple clairvoyance and \"love \r\n  spells\". Many New Age occultists use the principles of Gematria and such to \r\n  discover \"their\" number, and so on. Ancient 'magicians' used 7 unique number squares as the basis for their wisdom. \r\n  Each square was arranged in such a way that the total of any column or row was \r\n  the same. Each of the seven 'magic' squares was also assigned a planetary value. \r\n  Mercury, Venus, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, and the Sun, are all associated \r\n  with a specific square. It is the Sun Square that is most relevent to bible \r\n  coding. The sun square is the 4th of the 7 magic squares and consists of every \r\n  number from 1 to 36, arranged in six rows and six columns. Each of the six rows \r\n  adds up to 111 and each of the six columns adds to 111. It is from the Magic \r\n  Square of the Sun that the infamous number 666 originates. 6 columns X 111 = \r\n  666. 6 rows X 111 = 666. All of the numbers 1 through 36 total 666. There are \r\n  a total of 3 squares and 6 rectangles within the Sun Square, each of which adds \r\n  to 74, and are listed below. 9 rectangles & squares X 74 = 666. 6 + 1 + 31 + 36 = 74 11 + 8 + 26 + 29 = 74 16 + 15 + 21 + 22 = 74 7 + 3 + 12 + 25 = 74 19 + 24 + 13 + 18 = 74 32 + 35 + 2 + 5 = 74 3 + 34 + 4 + 33 = 74 14 + 23 + 17 + 20 = 74 27 + 28 + 9 + 10 = 74 The numbers to keep track of here are 9, 74, and 666, as they will turn up \r\n  elsewhere later. Very possibly, the other squares contain number patterns that can be found \r\n  in the bible, but our focus will remain with the Sun Square. The number 666 \r\n  has 12 divisibles, and these divisibles are associated with the 12 signs of \r\n  the Zodiac. The Sun Square and its 12 divisibles (or 12 signs of the Zodiac) \r\n  serve to form a theme which was to become common in many later religions. Odin \r\n  had 12 chief priests, Solomon had 12 tribes of Israel, and Jesus had 12 disciples. \r\n  The 1 + 12 phenomenon is found in other areas as well. In U.S. courts, there \r\n  is a Judge, and twelve jurors. Anglo-Saxon folklore tells of King Arthur and \r\n  twelve Knights of the Round Table. Upon reflection this should be an obvious \r\n  analogue as King Arthur and the Round Table represent the Sun and the Sun Square, \r\n  and the 12 Knights represent the 12 signs of the Zodiac. It should be clear that the chances of these religions and folklore sharing \r\n  the 1 + 12 theme being a coincidence is gradually falling. Furthermore, since \r\n  the 1 + 12 theme appears primarily in Western religions, it is likely that they \r\n  originate from one source. This source has been given many names throughout \r\n  the centuries and usually takes the form of secret societies. At one point it \r\n  was discovered that certain sounds affected the subconcious mind, and it was \r\n  long known that the human animal is a herd animal. Perceptive people realized \r\n  that the two should be mixed very carefully. Some sound arrangements had a soothing \r\n  effect, while some had an angering effect, or a saddening effect. Ancient temples \r\n  were often constructed in such a way that the songs sung during services would \r\n  have a maximum effect on the mass. Certain notes can shatter glass, or render \r\n  humans unconcious, and it was this power that these societies intended to conceal. \r\n  Unscrupulous people could easily use this knowledge to the detriment of society. \r\n  When languages were constructed, their vowels and consonants were assigned numerical \r\n  values. The study of this alphabetic / numerical association is called Gematria, \r\n  and Gematria is used to assign numbers to sounds (words, phrases, etc.). Deities, or important figures in mythology and religion are constructed in \r\n  accordance with the principles outlined above. English Gematria assigns the \r\n  value of \"1\" to the letter \"A\", and \"2\" to the letter \"B\", etc. With this in \r\n  mind, look at the word \"Jesus\": J E S U S 10 + 5 + 19 + 21 + 19 = 74 Let it also be known that the word Jesus in Greek adds to \"888\" in Greek Gematria. \r\n  Greek Gematria increases by a factor of 10 each 8 characters, and the 24th characther \r\n  has a value of 800. Jesus is referred to as being the offspring of David throughout \r\n  the bible, and that referrence is due to the fact that the numerical value of \r\n  Jesus can be found in the Mars Square. If the Star of David is drawn in the \r\n  Mars Square, and the numbers in the Mars Square are reduced to single digits, \r\n  we observe the following phenomenon: 2 6 7 2 3 4 3 7 8 7 8 5 4 3 9 1 9 1 5 4 5 6 1 2 6 After drawing the Star of David inside this square, we see that the points \r\n  on the two triangles collect the numbers in such a way that each triangle has \r\n  a value of 741. The first triangle has the tip at the number '7' in the first \r\n  row, and its two base points sit at 4 and 1, if we travel clockwise. The inverted \r\n  triangle has its upper right point at the 7 in the last column, and travels \r\n  across the column to arrive at the 4 in the first column, and finally the 1 \r\n  at the tip. Inside the hexagram that the center of the Star forms, we see the \r\n  number 741 travel down the vertical axis and the number 543 travel across the \r\n  horizontal axis. 741 + 147 = 888 and 543 + 345 = 888. This is why Jesus is referred \r\n  to as a branch of David. Note that the word \"Joshua\" adds to \"74\" in the same way Jesus does, and incidentally \r\n  so does the word \"occult\". Even though it is thought to be common knowledge that a man named \"Shakespeare\" \r\n  wrote the collection of classic plays, an interesting 'coincidence' is found \r\n  by employing the coding concepts used by Francis Bacon (who supervised the writing \r\n  of the KJV). If we count 666 chapters backwards from the end of the bible, we \r\n  arrive at Psalm 46. Excluding the mysterious word \"selah\" (which appears 74 \r\n  times throughout the KJV) we count 46 words from the beginning of the chapter \r\n  and find the 46th word to be \"shake\". The 46th word from the end of the chapter \r\n  is \"spear\". This is coincidental to the theory held by some that Francis Bacon \r\n  wrote the works attributed to Shakespeare When constructing a code that is designed to be deciphered without a 'decoder's \r\n  guide' a cryptographer will use extremes as pointers to show us the structure \r\n  of the code. Tools such as longest, shortest, and repetition serve to draw attention. \r\n  In keeping with this theory, we notice that the shortest chapter in the bible, \r\n  Psalm 117, is also placed in the exact center. It contains exactly 33 words, \r\n  which by no coincidence is the number of years in the life of Christ, the number \r\n  of generations from Adam to David, and the number of degrees in Freemasonry. On counting sets of 33 chapters from the beginning of the bible we find that \r\n  the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 6. 9 sets of 33 chapters backwards from Psalm 117, \r\n  we find that the 9th set lands on 1 Kings 7. The chapters 1 Kings 6 and 1 Kings \r\n  7 detail the construction of Solomon's Temple. The Temple is begun in 1 Kings \r\n  6, and construction ends in 1 Kings 7. Due to the fact that the word \"temple\" is often associated with perfected man, \r\n  and wisdom, a great deal of coding can be found within the biblical concept \r\n  of Solomon. The word \"Solomon\" serves a dual purpose in the coding of the bible. \r\n  The word \"Sol\" is Latin for \"sun\", the word \"Om\" is Hindi for \"sun\" and the \r\n  word \"On\" is Egyptian for \"sun\". Also, the vowel \"o\" is symmetrically placed \r\n  throughout the word 3 times. Note that \"o\" is the 15th letter in the alphabet: O O O 15 15 15 1 + 5 1 + 5 1 + 5 = 666 Even when presented with information such as this, the Christians will grow \r\n  stronger in their proclaimations that the practice of Numerology is evil. Sometimes \r\n  it will be suggested that perhaps this coding was designed by the devil to discredit \r\n  the 'truth' of Christianity. Nonetheless Solomon was designed to code 666 and \r\n  the Sun Square, and makes references to the 'temple', all of which are concepts \r\n  borrowed from the ancient Occult. Not unlike the 1 + 12 theme, the recurrence of the number \"7\" in religion and \r\n  mythology is significant. The Seven Seals of Revelation is a reference to the \r\n  7 magic Squares, as are other references to 7 in the bible: Seven horns and seven eyes are the seven spirits of God (Rev 5:6), Seven lamps \r\n  of fire which are the seven spirits of God (Rev 4:5) are all references to the \r\n  7 magic squares. Sometimes methods other than Gematria and Numerological coding are used, and \r\n  in Revelation 2:17 we discover coded in that verse the belief system held by \r\n  Francis Bacon and the Initiates who wrote the King James Bible. Revelation 2:17 \r\n  reads \"He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; \r\n  To him that overcometh will Igive to eat of the hidden manna, and will give \r\n  him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth \r\n  saving he that receiveth it\" In this case, the passage points to a new name written in 'a white stone'. \r\n  If one were to unscramble the words 'a white stone' we will get 'thee is wotan'. \r\n  Remember Wotan is a deity in the pantheon known as Asatru, and sometimes goes \r\n  by the name 'Woden' or 'Odin'. The odds on that being a coincidence simply cannot \r\n  be fathomed. Other than the passages to be unscrambled (\"a white stone\" - \"thee is wotan\") \r\n  and the subtle references to the magic squares, most of the words in the bible \r\n  are 'filler', which serve no real interpretive purpose. The bible is so full \r\n  of contradictions and pure nonsense that it only stands to reason that it was \r\n  not meant to be read, but counted. Other theories suggest that the King James \r\n  bible was written as a time-bomb designed to destroy Christianity. Others suggest \r\n  that Christianity in general was designed to destroy the West, and that the \r\n  KJV was designed to warn us and was coded to preserve ancient wisdom. Both theories \r\n  fit the facts outlined above, but it is doubtful that the whole story will ever \r\n  be known. Now that the coding system has been discovered, the dominoes will begin to \r\n  fall. Given enough time, we can no doubt unravel all of the wisdom encoded into \r\n  the KJV and discover the knowledge known only by a few, and persecuted by religious \r\n  tyrants for hundreds of years. This essay outlined a few pointers and coding \r\n  principles and the reader is encouraged to discover more. Remember, count the \r\n  bible, don't read it! RR"}]}

But I've just noticed that using KDE on the same machine but with Debian feels faster than using KDE with SuSE, and these are the SuSE numbers. By Anonymous, at 2:08 PM @Illissius please re-read the blog entry. i think you missed three important things: 1) i note that KDE can and should be made faster, including start up. so i'm not sure what you're going on about. 2) this is about konsole on X11/Unix, not kwrite and not notepad on win32. i know the similarity between konsole and kwrite or xterm and notepad can lead to confusion (he says, firmly tongue in cheek) but today's blog was about konsole. on X11. on Unix type platforms. 3) moreover, the whole point of the blog was to show that Malte's numbers weren't as good as they could be. you demonstrate that yourself with KWrite dropping from ~3s to ~1s with prelink, which means instead of being 6 times slower to start than your win32 app it's only 2 times slower to start. and that doubling in time equates to half a second! in summary: i completely agree that we can and should do better in the start up category. but we don't nearly deserve the rap we have at the moment. you'd think we were molasses on a winter day given how people yam on about it. the way it's commonly talked about, you'd think KDE apps take dozens of seconds or even minutes to start up! that KDE requires half a gig of RAM! etc, etc... all i'm looking for is some accurate and factual representations out there, because KDE and the Linux desktop in general is getting hurt by the mythconceptions that continue to float about. By Aaron J. Seigo , at 2:35 PM @Anonymous: 1.9 - 1.27 = 0.63 0.63 / 1.9 = 0.33 33% is significant from an optimization standpoint. it also drops the \"Xterm differential\" from ~4x to ~2.5x. and it means an extra 0.77s of wait. yep, still too long (because it isn't perfect ;) but not the drudgery that so many claim it to be. By Aaron J. Seigo , at 2:39 PM @aseigo: Iwas essentially agreeing with you. Startup times aren't only relevent for Konsole, which is why Igeneralized it, and KWrite was the first example Icould think of. 3 seconds (with the default setup) isn't completely horrible, but it can be painful when you just want to quickly edit some text, especially compared to something like Notepad which starts instantly. As for prelinking... is it a viable option to do this by default? From what Iremember there was something about the prelink going away if either the binary or the library linked to is changed, meaning startup times would gradually deteriorate over time... which isn't good. Or is there a better way to achieve the same effect? Anyways, as Isaid, I'm agreeing with you completely; just adding my own observations. -Illissius By Anonymous, at 3:11 PM Hi Aaron, to konsole: konsole has become quite bloated. It links to the huge kio lib just to have bookmarks. Inever used these bookmarks. Does anybody else ? Imeasured startup time, it must be already 3 years ago on my old K6/200. Originally it was 2.7 seconds. After one week of work Igot it down to 1.8 seconds. This was achieved by delaying everything what could be delayed (which resulted in not so easy to understand code). At least two times since then this delayed construction of stuff was broken and Ifixed it again. Ididn't look at it since some time now, so Idon't know if it currently works. As Imentioned, it was 1.8 seconds on a K6/200, KDE 2.x. Ialready thought about writing a slim konsole, with less features (or basically without kio) Bye Alex neundorf at kde dot org By Anonymous, at 3:13 PM @Illissius to prelink or not to prelink is something that's up to the individual OS vendors/projects. AFAIK, a lot of the benefits from the early prelink hack has been moved into the newer glibc's and ld's so these benefits should trickle on out to the world en masse with time. @Alex yeah, i remember your work on konsole start up times and vastly appreciated it when it happened (and then happened again ;). i'm not sure if it's been broken since, i surely hope not. as for the bookmarks and linking in libkio for that, i agree that it was a questionable feature add. of course, if we remove it now some small army of users will rise up in arms. ;-) i'll have to blog someday about the dangers of adding features just to add features. not like that hasn't be blog'd to death, but hey.... ;-) By Aaron J. Seigo , at 3:20 PM Aaron, first, thanks for the coolness factor -- Ihope you don't mind that Iuppercased your first I :) Inever intended my \"benchmark\" to be represantative, it was just something I, ummm..., hacked into a one shot Konsole Iopened for that reason :P  And actually, Kwrite, which Illissius mentioned, is another candidate which Iuse in that way. Whatever the kstart kluge you mentioned gave me a 33% speedup, too.  What's the difference with that? If it doesn't hve too much drawbacks, maybe instead of me having to prefix all the commands in KDE's .desktop files, something like that should become the default?  Or at least an option in KDE .desktop files to start apps like that? (Please don't ask me for code :) Cheers, Malte By Anonymous, at 4:44 PM Ijust tried, kstart doesn't change anything for me here. You can try kdeinit_wrapper konsole , this starts konsole vioa kdeinit (you probably already guessed). Now this is something nobody will type all the time. OTOH who starts konsole by typing konsole into a terminal ? AFAIK minicli also uses kdeinit to start kde apps. (maybe a bunch of aliases like alias Konsole = kdeinit_wrapper konsole wouldn't be too bad) Alex Alex By Anonymous, at 5:18 PM Don't we have a better place to discuss optimizations? Like, a certain mailing list? Anyway... The kstart vs no-kstart \"benchmark\" is flawed. Adding kstart to \"time konsole -e bash -c exit\" changes only two things: - makes the startup longer - makes 'time' measure the startup time of kstart (only) - Ican even see the output from 'time' here before konsole shows up For Alex, about kdeinit_wrapper: You can do 'ln -s /opt/kde3/bin/kdeinit_wrapper konsole' somewhere, and if you have that first in your $PATH, just doing 'konsole' will launch konsole using kdeinit (the same works with kshell and kwrapper - see kdelibs/kinit/README.wrapper). Lubos Lunak By Anonymous, at 2:27 AM isnt it strange if kstart and/or kde-init can make apps startup faster, they aren't normally used? is there some dis-advantage at stake, or should the distributions do it, or???

In a multicultural, multi-ethnic Europe, which is increasingly a refuge for asylum seekers and a destination for immigrants, the most pressing challenge for governments is to guarantee that the fundamental values of our societies, such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law, will be shared by everyone living in Europe. It is necessary to take up this challenge, in order to be able to benefit fully from the opportunities that immigration offers Europe in terms of the supply of labour, intellectual input and cultural diversity. I.       Draft resolution 1.       Strong, steady growth can be noted in human mobility. Europe, which is viewed as an area of stability and prosperity, will continue in coming years to be immensely attractive to migrants from less-favoured countries and to asylum seekers fleeing wars, persecution and human rights violations. 2.       In a multicultural, multi-ethnic Europe, which is increasingly a refuge for asylum seekers and a destination for immigrants, the most pressing challenge for governments is to guarantee that the fundamental values of our societies, such as the respect of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, will be shared by everyone living in Europe. 3.       It is necessary to take up this challenge in order to be able to benefit fully from the opportunities that immigration offers Europe in terms of the supply of labour, intellectual input and cultural diversity. 4.       The concept of integration aims at ensuring social cohesion through accommodation of diversity understood as a two-way process. On the one hand, immigrants have to accept basic values of European societies. On the other, host societies have to respect immigrants’ dignity and distinct identity and to take it into account when elaborating domestic policies. 5.       In accordance with its previous recommendations and resolutions, the Parliamentary Assembly reiterates the importance of implementing effective policies to ensure full integration of foreigners residing lawfully in Council of Europe member states as part of an overall strategy covering all aspects of migration, including labour migration and illegal migration, and the efforts to combat trafficking in human beings and to combat terrorism. 6.       In this connection, the Assembly refers to its Recommendation 1625 (2003) on policies for the integration of immigrants in Council of Europe member states and in particular reasserts the principle that immigrants should be able to participate fully in the life of the host country, on the basis of equality of rights and opportunities in return for equality of obligations. Those obligations include showing respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, for the principle of equality between women and men and, generally, for the Constitution and laws of the host state. 7.       Council of Europe member states must, for their part, ensure that, within their jurisdiction, immigrants are not discriminated against in terms of access to and protection of their rights, with a particular attention to certain sectors, such as education and employment. 8.       The Assembly draws attention to the many activities pursued by the Council of Europe's intergovernmental committees, in particular the European Committee on Migration (CDMG), to devise and promote integration policies capable of meeting the current challenges. 9.       In this connection, the Assembly calls on Council of Europe member states to: i.       make it one of their political priorities to agree a migration strategy, entailing an overall approach encompassing all aspects of migration, including its causes and consequences and the challenges it raises. In this context, it would be appropriate to: a.       emphasise the importance of co-development policies, with the aim of reducing poverty in the countries of origin, while giving them responsibility for managing development instruments and resources; b.       take steps to avoid migratory movements generated by the need for protection, through activities and means of pressure aimed at preventing conflicts and promoting respect for human rights in the countries of origin; ii.       ensure, in all their activities that may have implications for migration, including fighting terrorism, strict respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and the protocols thereto; iii.       offer opportunities for lawful immigration, with a view to employment, to a number of would-be emigrants on the basis of a selection founded on objective criteria which take account of labour market needs in the host country and its social system's capacity to guarantee a reasonable standard of living for these workers and their families; iv.       make a subsequent effort to foster knowledge of the fundamental values of the Council of Europe at all levels within society, in particular among immigrants, by: a.       holding courses on basic rights and responsibilities for newly arrived immigrants, free of charge; b.       including this type of instruction in optional or mandatory integration schemes for immigrants in those countries where such schemes exist; c.       where possible, organising this type of instruction in the countries of origin for would-be emigrants whose applications have been accepted; v.       promote campaigns for the distribution of reliable, clear information, not liable to be interpreted in a racist or xenophobic manner, on migration and on the culture, traditions and integration objectives of immigrants living within their borders; vi.       develop reliable instruments for measuring migratory movements at national level and co-operate in ensuring data comparability at an international level. 10.       In addition, the Assembly invites the European Union to: i.       pursue its efforts to establish a common asylum and migration policy; ii.       support the new member states' efforts to cope with illegal immigration and to endow them with legal and practical means of enhancing immigrants' integration; iii.       help raise European public awareness of the consequences of the accession of the new member states and of their citizens' rights with regard to freedom of movement. II.       Explanatory memorandum by Mr Jean-Guy Branger \"Immigrants are a living testimony to history and to the present.\" Emile Mallet, Sociologist I.        Introduction 1.       The issues raised by immigration and integration represent a huge challenge that Europe must now take up. This is because human mobility is showing strong, steady growth. Europe, which is perceived as a stable, prosperous area, will continue in coming years to be extremely attractive to migrants from less fortunate countries. The Council of Europe has to take full part in debate on the integration process, as the challenge posed is consistent with fulfilment of its principal objectives. 2.       The vast majority of people who have settled in Europe on a long-term basis have gradually become integrated in the population of the host country and aspire to live there peacefully, being aware of the advantages Europe has to offer in terms of respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights, employment and access to health care and, in the case of their children, to education. Yet most of the Council of Europe member states are now reconsidering the integration policies they have pursued to date, which have not succeeded fully satisfactorily in integrating immigrants lawfully resident on their territory and members of their families into the economic, social and political set-up of the country. This situation is reflected in the compartmentalisation of society and fosters feelings of intolerance and xenophobia. 3.       While western Europe has taken in tens of millions of immigrants who came in search of freedom and the opportunity to prosper, it is now the destination of waves of migrants from areas where not only is there rampant poverty, but despotic governments or terrorist groups act in an arbitrary fashion or are guilty of persecution or violence. All that these prospective immigrants know about European civilisation is that it is materially successful; they are unaware of the rules underpinning our societies, which are based on the principles of equality and the universality of human rights. These migrants put our societies in a paradoxical situation, insofar as people come to Europe in search of protection against arbitrary rule and access to political, social and financial independence, whereas certain groups would like to impose rules governing \"immigrant communities\" that are at variance with the independence that goes hand-in-hand with equality and the universality of human rights. 4.       It is all the more difficult to rise to the challenge as the second-generation and third-generation children of immigrants sometimes claim to adhere to \"fundamentalist\" groups, whereas their parents wanted themselves and their children to become integrated into the host society. 5.       This challenge is having to be addressed in a difficult climate, in which there is a decline in the number of industrial jobs in Europe as a result of relocation and, at the same time, an influx of poorly-skilled immigrants who, precisely the because of their lack of skills, have problems in finding jobs. It has to be admitted that the difficulties experienced by certain immigrants are exploited, under the pretext of the strict enforcement of certain religious laws, for subversive political ends, which go so far as to include enlistment by terrorist groups, as is borne out by the attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001 and those in Madrid on 11 March 2004. 6.       It must likewise be admitted that certain iniquitous religious leaders stir up feelings of hatred or even racism towards the host society or some sections of that society. This is leading to an unacceptable resurgence of the anti-Semitism that left its tragic mark on Europe's history. Our countries must not turn a blind eye to these challenges to their own values and must take a firm stand in response to those who call for ever-greater tolerance and who at the same time disseminate messages of hatred or even encourage terrorism. This firm stand must, however, be taken with due regard for the rules laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights and the constitutional safeguards in force in European countries. 7.       The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has paid particularly close attention to the question of integrating immigrants, a field in which it has adopted, inter alia, Recommendation 712 (1973) on integration of migrant workers with the society of their host countries, Resolution 631 (1976) on integration of migrants into society as regards education and cultural development, Recommendation 1206 (1993) on integration of migrants and community relations, Recommendation 1500 (2001) on participation of immigrants and foreign residents in political life in the Council of Europe member states and Recommendation 1596 (2003) on the situation of young migrants in Europe. The Rapporteur  also wishes to mention Recommendation 1625 (2003) on policies for the integration of immigrants in Council of Europe member states, and in particular the principle that immigrants should be able to participate fully in the life of the host country's society on the basis of equality of rights and opportunities in return for equality of obligations. 2.       Fundamental values of the Council of Europe 8.       The fundamental values upheld by the Council of Europe are human rights, pluralist democracy, the rule of law, which takes precedence over force, and the promotion of the cultural diversity of Europe. This diversity is not a culture in itself, but a mosaic of different cultures. 9.       Since 11 September 2001 it has been necessary to supplement these values with a political objective common to all member states: that of combating terrorism, which, having struck in other parts of the world before reaching our borders, made its full presence felt within Europe itself, with the bloody attack in Madrid in March 2004 (a repeat of the attacks in Paris in 1986, among others). The constant threat we face from terrorist groups is such that we cannot lower our guard in the near or foreseeable future: it is a key factor that must now be incorporated in our discussions on immigration and integration. 10.       Fundamentalism can lead to terrorism, and we must take this into account in our own countries by ensuring that the groups concerned do not have a podium within our national borders that they can use to spread hate; at the same time, we must be careful that the, albeit necessary, measures taken do not undermine the Council of Europe's values by imposing unwarranted, disproportionate restrictions on immigrants' personal freedoms or by discriminating against them. Combating illegal immigration, and dismantling the human trafficking networks which are, unfortunately, all too common on European territory, are also priorities for the future. France, with the reform of its legislation early in 2004 at the instigation of Mr Nicolas Sarkozy, is one of the countries behind this approach. 3.       Demographic context 3.1.       Statistics 1 3.1.1.       Population trends in the main regions of Europe from 1950 to 2050 11.       Analyses for western Europe based on work by the United Nations dating from 2001 reveal the following situation: after a very steep population increase between 1950 and 1975, the pace of increase declines until 2010; the population then tends to stagnate until 2013, after which it begins to fall increasingly steeply until 2050. 12.       In southern Europe there is a substantial increase until the 1990s, which then slows down until 2010, after which the population falls sharply, to return to the 1960 figure by 2050. 13.       In northern Europe, the population increase is moderate but steady from the 1950s to the 2030s, and then declines very slightly until 2050. 14.       In eastern Europe, excluding the Russian Federation, the situation is somewhat comparable to that in southern Europe, with an even more substantial rise in population until the 2000s, followed by a much faster, sharper fall, bringing the population in 2050 back to what it was in 1950. 15.       The situation in the Russian Federation is even more dramatic: having shot up in the period up to the 1990s, the population falls particularly quickly and spectacularly up to 2050. 16.       All these analysis are based on the likely hypothesis that the fertility rate will rise slightly but will never be sufficient to make good the difference between the number of births and the number of deaths, as the latter is, on average, increasingly high. 17.       We can therefore expect a general decline in Europe's population, which it will not be possible to offset by fertility alone. 3.1.2.       Fertility 2 18.       The annual fertility rate in Europe is particularly low, although there are many geographical disparities. Europe is having to cope with an ageing population, and hence a shrinking work force, matched by an increase in the retired population. 19.       In France, births exceed deaths by a figure of some 250,000. Norway and the Netherlands also have significant excesses of births over deaths. The United Kingdom has a slight excess, while in Sweden there are equal numbers of births and deaths. In Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Poland, there has been a small variation, resulting in the number of births being slightly lower than the number of deaths. In Germany and central Europe there are already more deaths than births: the situation is alarming in the Russian Federation. 20.       At the same time, the populations of the United States and Canada are growing steadily. 3.1.3.       Migration 3 21.       The 20th century saw an increase in migration, one reason being the growing number and increasing speed of means of communication. Unfortunately, however, the main explanation is the existence, firstly, of major world conflicts and, secondly, of local/regional conflicts nearer home. 22.       Before the Second World War, Europe had more emigrants than immigrants. The trend was gradually reversed and, little by little, spread even to the southern European countries. The collapse of the Soviet Union did not lead to as great a population movement towards western Europe as had been feared in certain quarters, particularly in view of the enlargement of the European Union. On the other hand, the conflicts tearing central and west Africa apart, along with poverty and population growth rates that always exceed economic growth, however vigorous that may be, prompt thousands of men and women to try to emigrate to Europe. 23.       It is worth taking a look at the percentage of immigrants in a number of countries between 1980 and 2000. In Belgium it was fairly stable, apart from a slight fall in the late 1980s, at 9% of the total population. In Germany, apart from a decline between 1992 and 1994, which was soon made good, it increased steadily, from 7.2 to about 8.3%. In Italy, which was for long time an emigration country, the proportion remained very low, even though it rose rapidly, from 0.3 to 2.8%, largely because of the arrival of an ever-growing number of illegal immigrants from Africa in Sicily and other Mediterranean islands, such as Lampedusa, or from Albania and the Balkans. It is particularly worth taking note of the situation in Switzerland, which is completely different, in that Switzerland is the only Council of Europe member state to have introduced and administered a genuine immigration policy, quantified according to its needs: the proportion of the population accounted for by immigrants rose from 14% in 1980 to over 19% in 1996; this was followed by a steady but as yet moderate fall to just over 18% of the total population. 3.2.       Excess of births over deaths and net migration 24.       Net migration, or the difference over a given period between the number of emigrants and the number of immigrants, is a variable that is difficult to assess in many countries, because the figures used to establish it are often unreliable, particularly on account of illegal immigration, which is inherently difficult to quantify. The myth of \"Fortress Europe\" must be refuted, as is demonstrated by the report by Mr Thierry Mariani, French member of parliament. In the year 2000, 1.7 million people lawfully entered the 15-member European Union alone, while the number of new illegal immigrants is estimated at 500,000. The total figure of 2,200,000 people means that five times the population of Luxembourg, or a population equivalent to that of the city of Berlin, settled in Europe in one year. France took in some 200,000 new legal immigrants in 2002, while 150,000 people obtained French nationality and were therefore no longer counted as foreigners. 25.       The actual figure is very often twice that indicated by the official statistics. Even if we were to double the latter, however, the result would not be sufficient to offset the general decline in fertility. 26.       Can population trends be influenced? There is no certainty that it will be possible to bring about a resurgence of the birth rate, a very uncertain parameter, in all the member states. Moreover, the effects of any such resurgence would not be apparent until much later, since it is estimated that it takes 25 years for a demographic change of this kind to make itself felt. As for the decline in mortality and the increase in longevity, we can only welcome these trends and hope that they continue and are matched by an improvement in the quality of life in the extra years gained. Account has to be taken of decline in mortality, which is accompanied by ageing of the population, which places a heavy burden on national and European budgets. 27.       This brings us to the European context of migration. Europe has to prepare itself to continue to receive new arrivals. This immigration may be desired and organised (selective immigration) or uncontrolled. The immigrants will have to be integrated, and it must be borne in mind that the previous generations were not always integrated easily or satisfactorily. 28.       The experts all agree that immigration cannot be considered a miracle solution that will offset the effects of the ageing of the population and the falling birth rate, for immigrants themselves are ageing, and their average age is only slightly lower than that of the host population. There are those who contend that this means that ever-increasing immigration is necessary. Massive immigration might be more profitable in purely demographic terms and could attenuate the impact of the ageing of the population, but the benefits have to be set against the fact that the number of jobs, including those that are most accessible, is shrinking because industries are relocating outside Europe, and against the economic and social problems that massive immigration may cause, given that the integration process is inherently slow. 4.       Migration context 4.1.       Historical background 29.       It should first be noted that, although instruments for measuring migration exist, the figures produced are often inaccurate, either because of a lack of political will or because the resources needed to use them are lacking. This is the case in the most highly developed countries. The situation is even more complicated in countries where facilities for monitoring migration are not yet properly established, as in some of the new EU member states. 30.       Immigration takes very different forms, depending on the country concerned, its geographical location and its history. 31.       After taking in immigrant labour, after the Second World War, from its eastern and southern regions and then from North Africa and the former colonies, Europe is now taking in migrants from countries where there is great social deprivation, from war zones and from areas ruled by despots. 32.       Germany, for instance, took in 12 million refugees of German origin after 1945, and 3 million East Germans between 1949 in 1961. Thereafter, the bulk of immigration came from Portugal, Greece and the former Yugoslavia. This was followed by substantial Turkish immigration, currently estimated at nearly 3 million people. 33.       The Netherlands took in 300,000 returning emigrants from Indonesia, 200,000 from Surinam and 80,000 from the Dutch West Indies as a result of decolonisation. This was followed by substantial immigration from Morocco. 34.       Italy, having long been a source of emigration, gradually became an immigration country 4 , particularly after the dismantlement of Soviet Union. Aperiod of \"Muslim\" integration was followed by non-Muslim integration from Romania and Ukraine. There are now some 2,300,000 immigrants with residence permits. This figure does not cover minors, for whom there are no records. The very high number of lawful immigrants is the result of the fact that numerous immigrants have had their situation regularised. The latest round of regularisation, which took place in 2003, saw between 600,000 and 700,000 illegal immigrants regularised. The figures reveal a demographic change in the immigrant population: men have brought their wives to Italy, thereby reuniting their families. Muslim women, however, are not likely to work, in accordance with their cultural traditions. 35.       Britain experienced large-scale immigration following decolonisation, and in the 1990s became a preferred destination for asylum-seekers. This was because conditions of admission to the country were relatively attractive compared with some other European states, in particular loose border controls, the fact that new arrivals did not need to produce certain administrative documents and the complete freedom of expression prevailing there. This situation became a sticking point with France regarding illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants wishing to enter Britain transited via France, in the hope of slipping across the Channel, but were usually caught and found themselves blocked in northern France, where they were housed in increasingly overcrowded reception centres, including the regrettably well-known Sangatte camp. Living conditions in Sangatte were very poor, and inmates had no chance of remaining in France unless they were granted asylum (but that meant satisfying the conditions). Yet settling in Britain inspired such great hope that illegal immigrants continued to be drawn in large numbers to northern France, at the risk of being consigned to these squalid camps and subsequently expelled. The situation was resolved only when Britain agreed to review the status of these would-be immigrants and to change its asylum and immigration conditions. The most recent statistics show a plunge in applications for asylum in Britain in 2003, with 61,050 cases registered compared with 103,100 in 2002 5 . 36.       France's strong tradition of taking in immigrants and asylum-seekers is based on the prospect of their obtaining full citizenship. In 2002 France took in some 200,000 new arrivals, who came to stay, while 150,000 immigrants already settled in France were able to become naturalised and obtain all the rights available to French citizens. In the case of France, the immigration figures must be interpreted in the light of two specific legal features: jus soli , whereby nationality is acquired by virtue of birth on French territory, and the ease with which French nationality may be obtained. Thus, although the figure for the population of foreign nationality settled in France seems to have been stable for the last 50 years, at about 10% of the population, or some 5 million people, account must be taken of the 120,000 naturalisations that take place every year (the equivalent of the population of a city such as Rouen or Dijon) and the fact that French nationality is automatically granted to children born in France of foreign parents. Demographers have been able to establish that one French person in four has at least one grandparent of foreign extraction. If France had legislation comparable to that of the states that apply jus sanguinis , the figure for the proportion of immigrants settled in France would doubtless have to be doubled. Indeed, an earlier report presented to the Assembly stated that France accounted for 75% of immigrants of North African origin settled in Europe 6 . Quite apart from this steady immigration from its former colonies in North and West Africa, France is one of the main destinations of asylum-seekers not only from Africa but also from the Balkans, Central Asia and the Far East. France took in numerous asylum-seekers fleeing Vietnam after the Communist victory, the \"boat people\", whose quiet but outstanding success is a tribute to their courage and, at the same time, shows that communities with different cultures can live together harmoniously. There was then a rush of asylum-seekers from all the zones where there was conflict and poverty, from the Congo to Pakistan, not to mention the \"bogus\" asylum-seekers who migrate for economic reasons. 4.2.       Recent state of migration 7 37.       Germany absorbs a massive number of non-EU immigrants, the great majority from Turkey. France also attracts twice as many non-EU as EU immigrants, unlike Luxembourg and Ireland. Germany is still attracting more Turks, Poles and Italians. France takes in large numbers of Algerians and Moroccans. Finland is gradually becoming an immigration country. There is also considerably intra-EU movement between France, Germany and the United Kingdom. 38.       As Europe enlarges, its borders are pushed further back, and what was previously extra-Community immigration is now becoming an intra-EU migration flow; at the same time, countries from Poland to Cyprus now lie along the borders of eastern and southern Europe will henceforth be facing a new type of immigration from eastern Europe, Asia Minor, and even the Far East and Africa. 4.3.       Causes of migration 39.       Having taken in tens of millions of immigrants arriving in Europe in search of freedom and possible access to prosperity, the Old Continent is now the destination of migrants from areas afflicted not only by economic deprivation but also by arbitrary government or indeed persecution and violence by dictatorships and/or terrorist groups. The only thing such prospective emigrants know about European civilisation is its apparent material success: they know nothing of the rules governing the functioning of our societies, drawing on the principle of equality and universal individual rights. Even more seriously, many of them have no desire to share such principles, which some go about defying or even combating. 40.       The causes of migration may be broken down into three main trends: i.       demographic factors: differential population growth; high fertility rates, combined with high mortality rates, often compounded with one of the factors mentioned below, result in a migration flow which is vital for survival (the case of much of Asia, for instance, and Africa, with average birth rates of 7 surviving children per family, as in Nigeria); ii.       economic factors: underdevelopment, which happens when population growth exceeds economic growth, even where the latter is robust: this applies to immigration from the third world, with immigrants aspiring to a degree of prosperity inaccessible to them in their countries of origin; iii.       political factors: war, insecurity, oppression and ethnic and religious persecution. 41.       More and more emergency situations are due to famines, epidemics, tribal conflicts or terrorism. The most tragic problem, tragic because it should actually be the easiest to solve, is that of famines, given that they are often combined with other factors. The situation is exacerbated by the corruption of elites or warlords, who block the distribution of food aid, which is nevertheless widely available, or prevent it from reaching the actual famine victims. 4.4.       The economic and social consequences of migration in host societies 42.       The European context is difficult in that not only is industrial employment in decline, particularly owing to relocations, but also there is a huge influx of immigrants who have difficulty entering the labour market because they lack the requisite skills. 43.       Nevertheless, the consequences vary greatly depending on the host country and the immigrant population. 44.       As a general rule, unemployment rates among non-EU immigrant populations are much higher than among the indigenous populations, and this even applies to immigrants who have obtained their host country's nationality. Unfortunately, all too often severe discrimination in employment matters can be noted, although European legislation seeks to counter such practices. 8 However, discrimination is sometimes difficult to prove, since employers rarely admit to it and cite other reasons for failing to recruit people of foreign origin. In some countries, particularly France, pressure groups are taking steps to test recruitment practices using \"anonymised\" CVs, which initially show neither the name, the place of birth nor a photograph of job applicants but merely state their qualifications and occupational experience, to assess the role which \"gut reactions\" on purely racial or ethnic grounds play in foreigners' recruitment difficulties. To overcome the ever-present problem of unemployment among immigrant populations it is also essential to bear in mind the vital importance of education: mastery of the host country's language and obtaining training, if possible in keeping with labour market demand, are prerequisites if the problems posed by an under-qualified labour force are to be avoided. This is naturally a message which can be conveyed more easily and more effectively to school children. 45.       Family reunion of immigrants from Muslim regions raises the same problems throughout Europe, as integration of women in the labour market and, more generally, in community life collides with tradition, which can also curb the integration of children, particularly girls. Fortunately, increasing numbers of Maghrebi women, for instance, are militating for reconciling loyalty to their original culture in the private sphere with the exercise of all their civic rights. Such efforts can succeed provided that the host State ensures that the universal rights secured for all persons present in the territory of the 46 member States of the Council of Europe under the European Convention on Human Rights take precedence over the influence of those who presume to regiment the immigrant \"communities\". As for immigration from eastern Europe, in Italy, for example, this mainly involves female immigrants, thus fitting in with a specifically Italian social, economic and cultural reality: most of these women work as cleaners, and especially as home helps. The Italian State has washed its hands of family and old-age policy: Italian families are becoming smaller and smaller, and family assistance is being farmed out to private companies to meet social needs. 46.       In most European immigration areas female labour centres on local unskilled service activities, at least for the first-generation immigrants. However, many young women of immigrant origin have achieved excellent school results followed by brilliant professional careers, provided that their cultural traditions do not bar them from the educational and training courses that provide the best qualifications. 47.       We must also consider the social costs of immigration. This is a tricky matter because we must avoid lapsing into caricature and prejudice. Admittedly we do have to combat illegal immigration, beginning by prosecuting the people-smugglers who take advantage of prospective travellers to Europe, showing utter disregard for the very lives of their passengers: no one can forget the 56 Chinese people who died of suffocation in a lorry on their way to Great Britain, the Africans who die while attempting to reach Spain across the Straits of Gibraltar, or the very recent case of the makeshift boats that left a few dozen survivors washed up on the southern shores of Italy, several dozen having drowned during a crossing that had cost them several thousand Euros, etc. Illegal work must also be discouraged, as it jeopardises the unprotected immigrants and distorts the labour market in the host countries. 48.       Although we must also combat the occasional abuses of the system, with some individuals attempting to live solely from social welfare without making any contribution to the host country's economy, once we have secured effective measures against illegal immigration and have successfully prosecuted the abuses noted, the funds expended on behalf of immigrants must be regarded as an investment which will eventually benefit all the host communities. 49.       This applies in particular to educational and medical expenditure. Not only will well-educated, healthy people \"integrate\" more easily into the national host communities, but also they will considerably enrich them. Another major side-effect is that they will less easily fall prey to the advocates of fundamentalism and rejection of Western standards, whose hate-filled word are fuelled by frustration. So the individual States must take account of these realities and plan the corresponding expenditure, including social welfare spending. 50.       Alongside the economic and social consequences of migration, there also arises the central question of immigrant integration in the host societies. 5.       Integration in the host communities 5.1.       Possible conceptions of integration 51.       Avariety of conceptions of integration coexist within Europe. We must also look beyond our borders for other possible definitions of integration. 52.       Arange of different policies have been implemented throughout Europe, and all these policies have shown their limits. Although we should bear in mind all the different approaches and possibly use them as a basis for our investigations, they cannot simply be transposed as they stand. 53.       We must fight shy of any attempt to standardise integratio n, and instead try to reconcile the various approaches to immigration depending on the traditions and legislation in force in the host States. The main distinction to be drawn is between assimilation of immigrants and communalism or multiculturalism. 54.       Assimilation - which is inconsistent with the values of the Council of Europe - confines cultural or religious differences to the private sphere and shuns any consideration of \"ethnic origins\". Individuals must blend into the national community. All members of society must share the same social blueprint and common values. They must accept the same laws and enjoy the same rights in accordance with the principles of equality and universality. The optimum indicator for assimilation is where the assimilated individuals' specificities are pushed into the background as a token of their renunciation of certain elements of their original culture and of their integration into a specific community of individuals. 55.       Conversely, under communalism, which we has never been accurately defined, the specific immigrant community becomes, to some minds, a value at least as important as the universal values of freedom and equality; others would define it as a socio-political project aimed at subjecting the members of a specified group to a set of rules deemed to be specific to this group 9 . 56.       According to its Latin origin, the concept of integration means \"bringing a part into a whole\". It is one of the essential functions of the social system, ensuring the co-ordination of the various sections of society with a view to guaranteeing the proper functioning of the whole system. For instance, we call a society well integrated if it has a high level of social cohesion, and an individual is deemed to be well integrated if he or she shares the values and norms of the society to which he or she belongs. By definition, integration involves all the interactions between the members of society, giving rise to a feeling of identification with the group and its values. 57.       In France, the Higher Council for Integration, set up in 1990, describes integration not as a medium term between assimilation and mere insertion but as a specific process prompting active participation in national society by a variety of different elements, while at the same time accepting the continuation of cultural, social and moral specificities and holding that the whole is enriched by such diversity and complexity. Instead of negating differences, a proper integration policy takes account of them without exalting them, and emphasises the similarities and convergences in order, with equality of rights and obligations, to establish solidarity among the different ethnic and cultural components of society and to enable everyone, whatever his or her origin, to live in this society, whose rules he or she has accepted and of which he or she has become a component part 10 . 58.       The United Kingdom has been seen as a laboratory for testing integration issues. During the post-war period, when the decolonisation process was providing an effective stimulus to immigration, the country was at first determined to assimilate these newcomers, granting them all civic, social and political rights on their entry into the national territory. Subsequently, after the first race riots broke out in the 1960s, the British Government noted that formal assimilation was not having the desired effect: it lacked a social strand, a real access to work. The UK definition of integration, as laid down in 1966, highlighted cultural diversity and equality of opportunity in a climate of mutual tolerance. The UK abandoned assimilation in favour of a new \"Race Relations\" concept: equal opportunities for all, against a background of cultural diversity and mutual tolerance, thus ushering in the multicultural era in Britain. For about a decade now, and more acutely since the turn of the millennium, this model has been under renewed scrutiny, the finger being pointed at the lack of values shared by all and of any real common feeling of \"Britishness\". This has been compounded since 2001 with the problems of combating terrorism. Large numbers of Muslim immigrants have been arriving in the country, giving rise to questions concerning their allegiance: with police action against terrorist plots and subversive \"sermons\" by certain \"religious\" leaders and the rise of populism and xenophobia, the United Kingdom is casting around for a fresh approach in integration policy. 59.       The German priority has been integration through the labour market, involving the trade unions and works councils. So there is a high level of unionisation, which makes for good working conditions: the unionisation rate for German nationals is 36%, with 50% for Turks living in Germany and 43% for other foreigners. Changes to the nationality law, which now combines the jus sanguinis tradition with some elements of jus loci , should encourage access by Turks, in particular, to German nationality, thus improving their chances of integration. 60.       Italy is apparently attempting to integrate its immigrants, although this attempt is unlikely to succeed in the long term: it periodically regularises a number of illegal immigrants, but stops short of forcing employers to re-recruit legally their former undeclared workers, thus promoting unemployment and maintaining the moonlighting mindset. Italy advocates the right to difference rather than assimilation. 61.       Moving on beyond the borders of Europe, we might take a look at the American and Canadian models 11 . They conduct an active and intensive policy in favour of a high level of immigration. The new arrivals find it difficult to adapt because of their origins: language, culture, religion and wide socio-economic discrepancies, reaching both ends of the spectrum (low standard of education and resources for some, and high qualifications and wealth for others). 62.       In 1971 Canada adopted an official multiculturalist policy. Training is provided in the official languages, the courses initially being confined to the workers themselves but subsequently being extended to their spouses and children. The State funds various aid agencies and runs reception programmes in order to provide immigrants with day-today support. However, aid policy still centres primarily on language assistance. Immigrants are entitled to integration assistance after one year's residence in the national territory. However, the plan to transfer specified powers wielded by the civil courts to community \"tribunals\" organised according to the specific standards of each immigrant group is causing some concern. For instance, Muslim \"tribunals\" would be able to apply Sharia law to Muslim communities, covering marriage, divorce, inheritance, etc. Given that Canada is a State that enjoys observer status with the Council of Europe, it is undesirable that it permit the implementation in its territory of standards which not only contradict the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights but above all negate the principle of equality between women and men, a field in which Canada was one of the pioneers. 63.       The United States of America traditionally takes a passive attitude to immigrants. From the outset there has been a clear determination to exclude individuals unable to provide for themselves, and so the State has never introduced any kind of assistance programme. Minor support programmes have gradually grown up, although no real resources have been earmarked for them. Aradical reform of the welfare system was launched in 1996, leading to a situation where non-citizens have no access to social programmes until they have been in residence for at least five years. 64.       President Carter introduced an urban renewal policy in order to rehabilitate the major city centres, where the poorest groups are traditionally concentrated, ie Afro-Americans, Hispanics and new immigrants, and to promote a mingling of populations in both racial and economic terms. The various communities are being encouraged to integrate as both confidence-building agencies and driving forces for integration by improving economic and social living conditions. 65.       The United States presents a virtually unprecedented paradox: as a country created through immigration by European groups fleeing religious persecution, it has gradually taken in immigrants of all origins: Irish people fleeing the famine, Jews fleeing the pogroms of eastern Europe and Nazism, followed by defectors from countries oppressed by communism: Russians, Cambodians and Chinese, including their top scientists. There were also Cubans. Finally the \"economic refugees\" started slipping in across the Mexican border or took their chance with the Lottery which each year officially attributed tens of thousands of residence permits. The fact is that these groups show a striking attachment to their host country, the first glimpse of which for many of them is Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty looming over the entrance to New York harbour. 66.       The United States, no doubt anchored in this self-image as a refuge for people fleeing religious persecution, is, in principle, in favour of freedom for groups claiming specific belonging to a community, which freedom is enshrined in the First Amendment to the Constitution and the established case-law of the Supreme Court. The acceptance of independently organised groups, including those operating along ethnic lines, has probably been reinforced by the recent realisation of the extermination of the American Indians and the anti-Black discrimination which still continues a century after the abolition of slavery. From Indian reservations to affirmative action, successive American administration have therefore granted specific rights to these groups, which have been rechristened Native Americans and Afro-Americans. 67.       Nevertheless, a number of minor conflicts have demonstrated that common rules can prevail over specificities, even when they are presented as a religious cornerstone: the prohibition of polygamy among the Mormons, and the obligation for women to produce bare-headed identity photographs, regardless of any Islamic precepts to the contrary. The trauma of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks has, to put it mildly, weakened this tolerance vis--vis all faiths, as witness the drastic controls effected on entrance to the United States, extending to both prospective immigrants and tourists. The various communities' freedom of internal organisation, inter alia along religious lines, will no doubt remain, but nor is there any doubt that the experience of terrorism on US soil will lead to greater caution about any demands liable to undermine a nation which glories in the motto \"Ex pluribus unum\". This might in fact lead to a question American understanding of the European approaches to the problem. 68.       France is often presented as the model of anti-communalism, rejecting collective rights in favour of individual rights as a guarantee of equality and universality. French policy in this field has long been based on a desire to cut back on the \"ethnicisation\" of suburban areas. The French tradition of centralisation is unitarian in thrust and would therefore seem to militate against the development of any potentially divisive specificities. France has no racially oriented tradition, something which is precluded by its highly individual conception of secularism. Open references to race are difficult to imagine, and in fact these are only just beginning to see the light of day with the tentative emergence of \"positive discrimination\", under pressure from Mr Nicolas Sarkozy. However, there is a genuine desire to implement strong policies on immigration and integration, with respect for specifically French republican traditions. For instance, as Mr Nicolas Sarkozy pointed out at a recent colloquy on migration organised at the suggestion of our Committee on Migration, Refugees and Population 12 , French society has perfectly well absorbed successive waves of immigration in the past, inter alia from Spain and Portugal, which helped the latter countries to achieve economic stability and become major European States. This justifies the conclusion that the enlargement of Europe will not create any major risks in terms of migration flow. But it does not mean that we must refrain from controlling immigration. France has adopted this approach by reforming its asylum laws and legislation on illegal immigration, which will enable it to provide better facilities for lawfully settled aliens. 69.       Much can be learned from the integration experiences of the new EU member states. Although accessible data are still in short supply, there can be no denying that these countries too have faced problems of integration, or reintegration. The partitioning of eastern Europe after the Second World War created administrative borders that had little in common with the pre-war borders, within which people of the same ethnic origin had been grouped together. As a result, after the fall of the Berlin wall and the subsequent reorganisation, masses of people crossed the former geographical borders to regain their homelands and/or nations of origin. Their reintegration was not always easy, since they had sometimes developed very different behaviour patterns and attitudes depending on the regimes under which they had lived. The most striking example of such differences is naturally that of the two Germanys. The Hungarian experience 13 in such matters is nonetheless worth noting, although it differs radically from the situation recently encountered in the EU's founder states: in Hungary the newcomers spoke the language and shared the host country's culture and history. 70.       In conclusion, it is important to note that integration is a dynamic process that can work both ways, each side deriving enrichment from the other's differences, as long as it takes place in accordance with the host country's traditional values. 71.       Obviously, any analysis of the concept of integration must include consideration of a phenomenon which often emerges alongside immigration, that is racism. 5.2.       Racism 14 72.       Ever since the 1980s Europe has been facing immigration of a type no longer aimed at providing labour or strictly deriving from decolonisation. This new type of immigration was neither desired nor deemed necessary for economic reasons. This was the starting point for a feeling which sometimes escalated to the point of total rejection of persons, based on racial criteria. 73.       Racism varies in accordance with the individual country's history, culture and economic situation. It also varies according to the period in history. It is often combine with anti-Semitism. 74.       In the second half of the 20 th century the racist phenomenon began to develop into something slightly more presentable and less obviously reprehensible. This \"valeting\" of racism derived from the immigration policies being implemented, from public support for various ostensibly acceptable theses, and from a swing towards acceptance of the exclusion of the Other, of those who are different. 75.       This meant defining the national identity with reference to a traditional hardcore made up of a shared history, culture and language, which is by definition inaccessible to anyone not born in the country in question. According to some theories, \"outsiders\" are even seen as a threat to the national identity, possibly presenting the nation with the need to defend itself. It is significant, for instance, that the building of mosques, which some regard as a sign of integration, demonstrating the will to stay in a given country while also freely exercising one's religion, as is traditionally provided for in national constitutions, is seen by others as a determination not to integrate, disavowal of the nation's traditional values. 76.       The media can also be a powerful intermediary for racism in that they can manipulate public opinion on the basis of facts often taken out of context, or else by overemphasising certain theories or offences which signally fail to reflect the loyal attitude of most immigrants. In 1985 in France, for instance, a high-circulation national newspaper terrified the public with a sensational front page headline asking \"Will we still be French in thirty years' time?\". More recently, a BBC commentator lapsed into some very unfortunate jibes against \"Arabs\", which led to his resignation but which had sufficient impact on public opinion for quite a few Britons to fall in behind him. 77.       With the current high level of immigration, there is a consensus that a system of immigrant selection will become necessary in European countries. Such selection must be accompanied with guarantees on non-discrimination 15 , or at the very least on a prohibition of any kind of discrimination that lacks objective, legitimate foundations such as possession of a given job specialisation or a specific qualification or diploma. The criteria for such selection should be completely transparent, reasoned and proportional. We must at all events welcome the reinforcement of legislation against racist comments and all forms of discrimination, as well as the strict application of the European Convention on Human Rights to all persons present in the territory of any of the Council of Europe States, whatever their nationality, gender or origin. 5.3.       How can integration be encouraged? 5.3.1.       By establishing genuine immigration policies 78.       In the past few years most European states have toughened up their immigration policies and strengthened the link between access to legal immigration and a commitment to integration on the part of would-be immigrants. Such a commitment, which is very often written into the law, is presented as an essential precondition for improving their administrative situation or acquiring additional rights. In some countries, the granting of a residence permit is conditional upon signing an \"integration contract\". 79.       In Denmark, for example, the law of July 2002 stipulates that a permanent residence permit and the related social benefits may not be granted until after a period of seven years of legal residence in the country, instead of three years previously. This permit is issued subject to passing Danish language, culture and history tests and a written undertaking to \"comply with local legislation\". Furthermore, Danish nationality is granted only after nine years of legal residence in the country, as compared with seven years previously. 80.       In Austria, the new immigration act, in force since January 2003, requires newly arrived non EU nationals or those who have been living in the country for less than five years to sign an integration contract under which they are obliged to learn the national language and familiarise themselves with national customs. Immigrants who fail the examination twice may have their residence permit withdrawn. Furthermore, knowledge of the German language is now compulsory for the acquisition of Austrian nationality. 81.       In the United Kingdom, but also in the Netherlands, all newly admitted immigrants must now participate in an \"integration programme\". In the United Kingdom, as well as having a command of English, immigrants must know how institutions work and show an understanding of British culture and civic life. They must take a citizenship test prior to integration. \"Citizenship ceremonies\" are now held at which applicants swear allegiance to the Queen and pledge to uphold the country's laws and democratic values. Candidates for British nationality must sit a language test. 82.       In France, the strong tradition of taking in immigrants and asylum-seekers is based on the prospect of full acquisition of citizenship. France took in some 200,000 stable new arrivals in 2002. At the same time, 150,000 immigrants already settled in France were naturalised, thus gaining access to all the rights of French citizens. As in the other countries of Europe, however, such a policy cannot be maintained and extended unless it is accompanied by a clear distinction between legal and illegal immigration. Two new laws were accordingly passed at the end of 2003, one relating to the control of immigration and the residence of foreigners in France, the other relating to the right of asylum. Measures have been taken to make the requirements for obtaining a visa stricter, new penalties have been introduced for those who employ illegal immigrants, and the new offence of organising marriages of convenience has been created. At the same time, the asylum system has been unified around the OFPRA (Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons) in order to create better conditions for examining applications and reduce the time taken to complete the procedure, while at the same time enabling a larger number of applicants to be eligible for refugee status. The \"French model\" is also based on a distinction between the private and public spheres. In the former, all the cultural or religious traditions which link immigrants to their country of origin may be expressed, provided they respect the fundamental rights of individuals. In the public sphere, public services and schools in particular are governed by the principle of secularity, which has made possible the peaceful co-existence of groups who clashed throughout the 19th century, almost to the point of civil war, on religious grounds. This is no doubt one of the options that could be suggested to certain states which are deeply divided between ethnic and religious groups caught up in an endless vendetta, resulting in countless deaths and constituting a fatal obstacle to economic development amid the spiral of poverty and hatred. 83.       The European Union is tending to take over from its member states' national policies in order to ensure harmonisation of the law of asylum and the conditions for legally entering the EU area. The European Union supplements this approach through agreements with the \"close neighbours\". The Justice and Home Affairs Directorate deals with migration, among other things. It has been given new powers since the Treaty of Amsterdam. The question of integration has come to the fore at European level in the past two years. The aim is not necessarily that Europe should choose an integration model, but that it should adopt a pragmatic approach: identify good integration practices, in a context of respect for European values, while ensuring a balance between immigrants' rights and obligations. 5.3.2.       By combating forms of exclusion 84.       The causes of integration difficulties are complex and depend to a great extent on immigrants' cultural and social origins and the host society's political and cultural traditions. Immigrants very often observe cultural, religious or social traditions which differ from the democratic values upheld by the host state. The integration process is made even more difficult by the fact that, very often, the usual instruments promoting social cohesion, such as access to the labour market, to the civil service or to schools genuinely encouraging an ethnic mix and social advancement, are largely closed to immigrants. 85.       Today, in most Council of Europe member states, certain communities play little or no part in the social, cultural or political structures of the host society and feel that they are victims of economic and racial discrimination, and these groups are very often concentrated in areas suffering from social deprivation. Hence these communities live in isolation in their neighbourhoods and continue to observe their customs and their way of life, which they hand down to, and sometimes impose on, their children. The latter, caught between two cultures, feel out of place and question their identity. Faced with problems of social integration, immigrants, whether new arrivals or members of the second and third generations, react very badly to exclusion, by rejecting the values of the host society. This leads to a feeling of social malaise and very often to the development of delinquency, particularly among young people, and, concurrently, the development of extremism. 86.       Generally speaking, there is a lack of social cohesion if the state's authority is challenged, if the state's standards and values are not recognised or if individuals are poorly integrated into the economy. There is a social fracture when a minority as such excludes itself from the community. This kind of \"ethnic\" isolation encourages community domination of certain neighbourhoods, and even the rise of religious fundamentalism. This situation entails dangers because it generates social tensions and weakens social cohesion and democratic values founded on equality of rights, duties and opportunities. 87.       Most European countries have been confronted with violent demonstrations by young people living in sensitive urban neighbourhoods. Sociological research has shown that these protests are the violent expression of a desire for social recognition on the part of a population relegated to the fringes of society, frustrated in its aspirations by a public order viewed solely in terms of its repressive function. As a general rule, these protests express a demand for greater equality, integration and social advancement. Some neighbourhoods on the urban periphery are victims of agitation by individuals who exploit these frustrations and seek to impose their \"own values\" and oppose any intrusion by law enforcement officials. States must endeavour to combat these phenomena, of which the inhabitants of these neighbourhoods, in particular young immigrants, are the first victims. 5.3.3.       Through social responses to exclusion 88.       Lawful immigrants form an integral part of our societies and their effective participation in the state machinery is an essential precondition for guaranteeing lasting social cohesion. It is indeed undesirable that, by reason of their ethnic origin, certain population groups within a country should be lastingly excluded from some aspects of state affairs. The efforts to combat discrimination in employment matters are an example of what can be done. These efforts must be extended to many other areas, although, in the Rapporteur 's contention, it is not necessarily scandalous that some types of jobs (in the armed forces or the judiciary, for instance) should be the preserve of nationals. Nonetheless, this should not constitute a ground for excluding these population groups from jobs where nationality criteria are no longer justified (for example, in France surveyors must still be of French nationality). 89.       In a communication dated 3 June 2003, the European Commission suggested defining integration as \"a two-way process based on mutual rights and corresponding obligations of legally resident third country nationals and the host society which provides for full participation of immigrants\". 90.       Essentially, integration policies should be policies of encouragement, aid and support, integration being a long-term, voluntary process which is sometimes difficult and which often concerns the first and second generations. The support aspect concerns the learning of the language of the host country, education for children and vocational training for young people. 91.       Because it is a decision to belong, integration presupposes a policy to inform would-be immigrants about their rights and obligations. Everyone has the right to respect for their identity, but they are also under an obligation, whatever their traditions and customs, to respect the principles and law of the host state, and to recognise and display, through their behaviour, the fact that they belong to that state. Integration means respecting imported cultures and peoples' identities, provided they do not challenge the foundations of the host society's culture and their manifestations do not violate public order or other people's rights and freedoms. In this connection, we should welcome the recent decision by the European Court of Human Rights setting limits on certain demands based on religious traditions in the light of the need for protection of other people's rights and freedoms, of public order viewed as an obligation for the authorities to preserve public peace, and, lastly, the principle of equality between men and women. 92.       The state must see to the provision of economic, social and cultural conditions that facilitate the integration of new arrivals who have entered its territory legally and of immigrants who have been established for several years. Generally speaking, it is by regarding immigrants as persons holding rights and, where appropriate, able to acquire full citizenship through naturalisation, that we shall give them the opportunity to become integrated without abandoning their identity. The state must take appropriate legislative measures to fight all discriminatory practices and measures against immigrant communities, on grounds of racial, ethnic or religious origin, whether in terms of access to employment, working conditions or access to housing. Conversely, the state must punish all incitement to hatred on the part of any individual, even from an immigrant background. States must maintain their policies of social development in sensitive urban neighbourhoods and support the initiatives of immigrants' representative organisations, which play a crucial role in the process of integration and social cohesion. They must also develop curricula emphasising the concepts of citizenship, respect for differences, social tolerance and, most importantly, respect for the guarantees of the European Convention on Human Rights and for the principle of equality, particularly between men and women. They can encourage awareness-raising campaigns to promote intercultural dialogue. They can also highlight positive examples of social advancement in various fields, or examples of immigrants or descendants of immigrants who have held political office. 93.       States should focus particular attention on improving the situation of immigrant women by according them specific rights, access to education and the labour market and real respect for their individual freedoms in the context of equality between men and women, including protection from \"customs\" that are contrary to public order and to Council of Europe conventions. The achievement of equal rights offers prospects for development which will spread to the societies of origin, with which these women retain links: changes in the status of women are the key to development in emigration countries, with control by women of their fertility, their health and that of their family, and with the guarantee of education and, above all, literacy skills being passed on. Failure in these areas would encourage communities to turn in on themselves. 5.3.4.       Reconciling integration and the fight against terrorism 94.       This has been a crucial issue since the events of 11 September 2001. Europe is under serious threat from Islamist groups who threaten to carry out actions within its frontiers, as they have done in Munich, Paris, Berlin and, on 11 March 2004, Madrid. At the same time, Europe is under potential threat from population groups already present on its territory. This is because they may be faced with a choice between loyalty to a given group, in this case the host country and nation, and possible allegiance to the causes promoted by terrorist groups. It is espousal of such causes which is likely to seriously endanger the host state. That is why the policies governing border controls and controls inside Europe have been tightened. Such policies are essential, but should remain in line with the positions traditionally defended by the Council of Europe. 95.       When rebellions are fuelled by subversive groups with the aim of carrying out terrorist attacks, states have a duty, while complying with constitutional rules and the European Convention on Human Rights, to take appropriate precautions, including international police and judicial co-operation, in the interests of those immigrants who aspire to live in peace in their host country and who publicly distance themselves from the terrorist groups, with which, therefore, they should not be indiscriminately associated. 96.       It is important not to give way to hate. In many non-European countries, the fight against terrorism has led to the flouting of basic rights. Even in Europe, political leaders have a responsibility to refrain from the kind of discourse that would fuel racism among the population and detract from the effectiveness of existing integration policies. 5.3.5.       Co-development: aid to the third world with the long-term aim of discouraging emigration and encouraging immigrants to return to their countries of origin 97.       It has been accepted for decades that the wealthiest countries have a duty to contribute to the economic and social development of third world countries, notably by earmarking a certain proportion of their gross domestic product for this purpose: we are forced to conclude that this amount, despite representing only a small percentage, has never been paid in full; as a result, the beneficial consequences this might have had have not taken place. But there are other factors too, one of them being the failings of certain third world elites. 98.       According to some commentators, the aid which has nevertheless been granted has been a resounding failure because the countries which have not received any are now rising economic powers (China, and more generally, south-east Asia), whereas the countries which have been \"drip fed\", in particular the former colonies of European countries, are more than ever third world nations, experiencing situations of famine or war, or indeed recession, which were unheard of in the days of colonisation. In Africa, for example, GDP is lower today than it was in 1980. 16 The aid granted sometimes falls over 90% short of the target. Worse still, aid programmes have very often hindered the reforms needed to adapt to changes in economic life, causing a lag in development which it is very difficult for these countries to make up. 99.       Aid policies have changed: they are aimed less at improving infrastructure than at promoting an institutional climate suitable for encouraging private investment and employment-creating small businesses: improved public order and security, education, health, more efficient public services etc. 100.       In this connection, the urgent need to help third world countries to fight the AIDS epidemic which is rampant there cannot be overlooked: it is one of the keys to their survival, and to ours. 101.       On the other hand, the development of micro-credit, which enables women, in particular, to set up businesses which will provide a livelihood for the whole family, has been a quite outstanding and heartening success, and should be continued. 102.       Lastly, it should be noted that some countries which have a large diaspora in another country, such as Morocco in France for example, have a real policy towards this emigrant population. In fact, Morocco has a minister responsible for Moroccans living abroad, whose duties include guaranteeing full citizenship to emigrants and involving the diaspora in the economic development of the country of origin. 103.       Co-development policies must be part and parcel of our overall approach to integration. Although co-development is not a factor which directly affects the integration of immigrant populations within our borders, it would be a good thing if it influenced migratory movements upstream, since, as we have seen above, something must be done to attempt to regulate these movements. Co-development is one means of doing so. By encouraging people to stay in their home country, naturally under conditions that are as consistent as possible with the Council of Europe's values, or inciting them to return there under such conditions, certain population flows towards our countries can be stemmed, while at the same time improving development prospects in other countries by avoiding a brain-drain of their most qualified young people. 5.3.6 Towards a concept of citizenship? 104.       The countries of Europe remain divided on some issues: one of which is the concept of citizenship. Some are ready to enhance the possibilities for immigrants to acquire citizens' rights: this is the case, inter alia, in France with regard to social rights, since no distinction based on nationality is drawn in granting welfare benefits; such a distinction is in fact officially prohibited, as the administrative courts regularly point out, in that all persons resident in the country are entitled to minimum standards of social protection. Other states do not fully concur with this position and have introduced duration of stay and/or language proficiency requirements. Yet others would like to go further by giving immigrants more rights, moving towards full citizenship - in particular, and this is often a source of problems, the right to vote in all elections. 105.       This is still a very divisive issue. By officialising various levels of citizenship (local, regional, national, supranational or transnational), European law itself does not offer any quick solutions to this lack of consensus. 106.       Each state is jealous of its own concept of citizenship and would like it to either take precedence over others or be preserved for national use. However, some, albeit partial and slow, progress can be noted. France's example is quite telling in this respect: secularity and the concept of the \"French people\" are two particularly important notions in France and underlie much of French legislation. Nonetheless, after many unfruitful attempts, with the courts showing a considerable reluctance to change the case-law, bordering on stubbornness, it has been possible to amend the concept of the \"French people\". France long held back from ratifying the Council of Europe's Charter for Regional or Minority Languages of 1992. In 1996 the Conseil d'Etat even held that the charter was incompatible with the French Constitution. In the end France signed the charter in 1999, but did not ratify it because the courts set great store by the concept of the \"French people\", making it absolutely impossible to recognise the existence of minorities within French territory. In March 2003, Article 1 of the Constitution was at last amended, to the effect that the Republic remained indivisible but its organisation was decentralised. This reform, passed without any general debate, is a sign of some initial progress in the way France conceives nationality and citizenship. 17 6.       Conclusions and recommendations 107.       In your Rapporteur's view, it is important to preserve the Council of Europe's fundamental values within its member states in the context of measures to be taken to promote the integration of immigrants. 108.       All the Council of Europe member states should therefore be reminded of what these values are, to provide them with a yardstick for assessing the legislation they are, or will be, implementing not only in the field of integration but also in that of the fight against terrorism or the fight against illegal immigration, since it has been shown that these form part of the same debate in the current world context. 109.       The Council of Europe's fundamental values - a commitment to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and individual freedoms, and the promotion of the European cultural diversity - should provide a common basis for all those who live in Europe, citizens or immigrants. 110.       Your Rapporteur gained the impression that the populations of the first 15 European Union member states had not yet gauged the full significance of the arrival of ten new countries last spring: in particular, better information would be desirable to ensure that these new populations joining the EU are no longer regarded by public opinion as immigrants from outside the community, but as fully-fledged members of the EU. 111.       In addition, all countries, and especially the new EU member states, should be encouraged to put in place and implement reliable instruments for measuring migration flows on their territory. 112.       The questions of immigration and integration should be the subject of an in-depth debate in all the member states so that all opinions can be heard, and not only the most extremist views, as is very often the case, in the absence of any marked political will in this area. 113.       The principle of controlling immigration should be established, in particular so as to avoid receiving a massive influx of immigrants which our labour market would be unable to absorb, particularly as a result of industrial relocation outside Europe. Indeed, it is inconceivable not to be able to guarantee new arrivals decent living conditions in terms of our own values. 114.       Measures to combat illegal immigration, mafia-type networks and human trafficking organisations should be extended to all the Council's member states. 115.       Inspiration should also be drawn from good practices observed in many member states, and it should be proposed that they be extended or adapted to the others. For example: i.       an attempt should be made to achieve Europe-wide harmonisation of asylum law and controls on illegal immigration, drawing inspiration, for example, from the courageous and ambitious reforms carried out in France; ii.       provisions should be introduced requiring immigrants to complete a transitional period of residence in the country in order to qualify for a residence permit and social benefits, as in Denmark; iii..       it should be ensured that immigrants learn the language of the host country and familiarise themselves with its culture, as in Austria. 116.       Steps should be taken to ensure that the authority of states does not come under challenge from, for example, fundamentalist movements: for instance by systematically balancing demands for respect for imported cultures and identities against fundamental principles such as those of public order, equality between men and women and recognition of the very foundations of the host state's culture. 117.       If public opinion in the member states of the Council of Europe is against immigrants, there can be no real integration. It is accordingly necessary to promote reliable, clear information campaigns, not liable to racist or xenophobic manipulation, concerning the issue of migration and the culture, traditions and integration problems of immigrants. 118.       Lastly, aid should be provided to help countries to retain populations who, previously, very often had no choice but to go into \"economic exile\", or encourage these people to return to their countries of origin in decent economic and social conditions. 119.       Similarly, where a former conflict area has achieved lasting stability and a regime in keeping with the Council of Europe's democratic values has been established, measures should be devised to encourage the voluntary return of immigrants from these countries to their countries of origin. 120.       In conclusion, although, in the current world context, your Rapporteur  does not entertain any misplaced optimism regarding the question of integration, is not pessimistic in the long term about the ability of European countries to reconcile integration and the Council of Europe's fundamental values. As the history of Europe has shown, with time integration has eventually been achieved in the best interests of each population. 121.       It is sincerely to be hoped that the context of terrorism prevailing at present around the world is not long-lasting and does not irremediably damage the ability of individuals to accept others.

Arm monitors are generally more accurate than wrist models; in our test, only one wrist model could match them. If you buy an arm monitor, measure your arm size to get the right-size cuff.

Models that inflate the cuff automatically tend to work better than those requiring you to do it manually (by pumping a bulb), though there are exceptions. The cuff has to be inflated to a level above the systolic blood pressure. However, the automatic setting on the monitor may be a lot higher, and you may find it uncomfortable. Models with adjustable inflation level allow you to program the pressure to one that's comfortable for you. Models with fuzzy logic detect the ideal inflation level automatically. If a monitor has a memory to store a number of your recent blood pressure measurements, it can be helpful as a back-up. However, it's a good idea to record all measurements separately, so that you and your GP get a sufficient history.

{"file_number": "17", "plaintext": [{"tag": "div", "text": "lymphedema therapists in North\r\n    Carolina"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "What is lymphedema? Lymphedema is the collection of lymph\r\n    fluid that can occur in your arm and hand after your lymph nodes have been removed or\r\n    damaged from your underarm area (axilla) during breast cancer surgery. What is lymph fluid? Lymph fluid is a colorless fluid\r\n    containing the white blood cells that fight infection and disease. Lymph fluid travels\r\n    through channels of the lymph system throughout your body much like blood travels through\r\n    arteries and veins. What are lymph nodes? Lymph nodes are small, pea-sized organs\r\n    located along the lymph channels. They are grouped in clusters. Their job is to trap\r\n    foreign bodies such as bacteria or cancer cells to keep them from spreading throughout the\r\n    body. The nodes are clustered in areas throughout your body such as underams (axilla),\r\n    groin, neck, chest and abdomen. The ones in your chest and underarm are the ones that\r\n    collect the lymph fluid from your breast. This is why they are often removed at the time\r\n    of surgery. What causes the arm to swell after\r\n    surgery? Not every woman's arm swells after surgery.\r\n    It swells because the number of pathways for the lymph to drain from the arm are reduced\r\n    by the removal of or damage to the lymph tissue during surgery or radiation therapy. Fewer\r\n    channels to drain the fluid can result in collection of fluid in the arm (or swelling).\r\n    The extent of lymph tissue removed or damaged relates to how much swelling you may\r\n    experience. Swelling may occur weeks, months or even years after treatment. Are there any safety precautions Ishould be aware of? Yes. Because the lymph channels and nodes\r\n    have been removed (or decreased) on the side of your surgery, you must take extra caution\r\n    to protect your hand and arm from injury, cuts, scrapes and insect bites. You may have\r\n    less protection against infection in that arm. Some people wear a medical alert bracelet\r\n    with this information on it. It is important to remind healthcare workers to avoid drawing\r\n    blood and measuring your blood pressure on that arm. It is also recommended that you wear\r\n    gloves while doing housework, gardening and other activities that may put your arm or hand\r\n    at risk for injury. In addition, it is possible for lymphedema to occur years after you\r\n    have finished your treatment; therefore, taking care and being aware are your two best\r\n    keys to avoiding or managing lymphedema. What about using antiperspirant or\r\n    deodorant under my arm? You should not use deodorants or\r\n    antiperspirants while you are healing from surgery on the armpit on the side of your\r\n    surgery. Once you are healed, you may use either antiperspirants or deodorants. Some\r\n    doctors may recommend use of deodorants only. You should talk about this with your\r\n    healthcare team. What can Ido about the swelling? Is\r\n    it permanent? You should talk with your doctor about\r\n    this. Sometimes, elevation of the arm for brief periods throughout the day is adequate to\r\n    promote fluid drainage. Other methods to reduce swelling include arm exercises and gentle\r\n    massage that specifically promote lymph drainage. Your doctor should refer you to a\r\n    practitioner who specializes in lymphedema treatment if you have a persistent problem with\r\n    this. More severe cases may require use of pressure sleeves to compress the arm.\r\n    Lymphedema can be a permanent condition in some cases. How do Ichoose a lymphedema\r\n    therapist? Lymphedema therapists have a range of\r\n    training options. The programs they attend vary in length. When you are choosing a\r\n    therapist, you might want to consider how much training he or she has. The programs include: LeDuc (6 days of\r\n    training), Lerner (14 days), Casley-Smith(14 days), Academy of Lymphatic Studies (ALS; 14\r\n    days), Klose-Norton (15 days), Foldi (20 days), and Vodder (20 days; some programs teach\r\n    Vodder \"techniques\", but only therapists who have completed the entire program are Vodder credentialed). Recently, the Lymphology\r\n    Association of North America (LANA) began certifying lymphedema therapists who also passed\r\n    a comprehensive national exam. If you have questions about the trainings, call the\r\n    National Lymphedema Network at 800.541.3259 or see http://www.lymphnet.org .

Manual Lymph Drainage is a massage technique used to\r\n    improve the flow of lymph using light, rhythmic strokes.  This therapy may be\r\n    effective for the lymphedema that sometimes follows breast surgery. MENOPAUSE (Natural & Chemotherapy-Induced) What is menopause? Menopause is the absence of menstrual\r\n    periods due to reduced function of the ovaries. This can occur naturally with aging, or\r\n    from damage to the ovaries. This naturally occurs in women beginning in their 40s and 50s. Will chemotherapy cause me to experience\r\n    menopause? Before menopause, your ovaries produce\r\n    estrogen. Estrogen is responsible for your monthly menstrual cycle and reproduction. Some\r\n    chemotherapy drugs interrupt (temporarily or permanently) ovarian function, which can\r\n    result in early (or chemotherapy-induced) menopause. This type of menopause can be\r\n    permanent and has the same effect on your body as naturally-occurring menopause. What are some of the typical side effects\r\n    of menopause? Hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal\r\n    dryness, and irregularity or absence of monthly menstrual periods are the most common\r\n    effects of menopause. Menopause is also associated with bone loss due to reduced calcium\r\n    stores in the bone. After chemotherapy treatment, some women\r\n    resume their menstrual cycle. If you do not, you should seek advice about calcium\r\n    replacement and exercise to promote bone health. What can Ido to manage side effects\r\n    of menopause, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness? You should discuss menopause management\r\n    strategies with your doctor or nurse. For hot flashes, there are medications available;\r\n    also, many people are beginning to explore the use of alternative therapies, such as soy\r\n    products or herbs. You should check with your doctor before proceeding with this approach.\r\n    You must always be cautious about the possibility of drug interactions when taking\r\n    supplements or herbals in addition to medications. Other considerations include choosing\r\n    loose-fitting, comfortable clothing and regulating the temperature control to suit your\r\n    preference. Vaginal dryness can be addressed through\r\n    the use of lubricants prior to sexual activity. There are many products available without\r\n    prescription to remedy this problem. Persistent vaginal itching should be investigated to\r\n    rule out the possibility of infection (see also the section below on Sexuality ). OSTEOPOROSIS (Natural & Chemotherapy-Induced) What is osteoporosis? Osteoporosis or \"porous bones\"\r\n    is a condition of decreased bone mass. Bone is living tissue that continuously undergoes\r\n    breakdown and rebuilding (at a cellular level) as a normal body process. Peak bone mass is\r\n    usually reached by age 38. After that, bone begins to lose mass as part of the aging\r\n    process. As bone mass is lost, bones become brittle. Men generally lose 20-30% of their\r\n    bone mass over their lifetime, and women generally lose 45-50% of their bone mass.\r\n    Decreased bone mass can lead to an increased risk of bone breakage and disability. Why is this important to me now, and what\r\n    are the risk factors? As a person receiving cancer treatment,\r\n    you are at increased risk for osteoporosis. Risk factors for osteoporosis include:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Early hormone deficiency (menopause) Chronic malnutrition Smoking Alcohol consumption Limited weight-bearing exercise Family history Ethnicity—more prevalent in\r\n        Caucasian (white) and Asian women Small body frame"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Chemotherapy can interfere with your\r\n    normal production of hormones due to its effect on ovarian function. Reduction or failure\r\n    of ovarian function automatically places you at increased risk for osteoporosis. It is\r\n    important that you discuss prevention and treatment strategies with your doctor or nurse. Would Iknow if Ihad osteoporosis? Can Ibe tested for it? Early changes in bone density are usually\r\n    painless. Most people don’t know they have osteoporosis until they break a bone. That\r\n    is why it is important to know the risk factors and to learn what you can do to prevent\r\n    bone deterioration. Testing can be done for osteoporosis.\r\n    First, you should have a thorough health history and physical exam to determine your risk\r\n    factors for osteoporosis. Then, your doctor will discuss or recommend your having a bone\r\n    mineral density test if you are considered to be at high risk. It is a safe, painless and\r\n    non-invasive test. This establishes your baseline bone density and provides useful\r\n    information in determining the best course of action for you. In North Carolina, bone mineral density\r\n    (BMD) tests are available in some pharmacies. The cost of measuring the BMD in the heel is\r\n    generally around $30, and this correlates well with the trabicular (spine) bone. This test\r\n    reveals very little about the cortical (hip) bones, so you will not get the whole picture.\r\n    However, the test will give you a reasonable assessment and baseline information that you\r\n    can take to your doctor to see if further testing is needed. The test takes about five\r\n    minutes or less and is pain free. You can have this test done without a referral from your\r\n    doctor. Can Ihelp prevent osteoporosis from\r\n    happening to me? Yes. There are a number of prevention\r\n    strategies that are recommended to reduce your risk for osteoporosis:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Eating a well-balanced, nutritious diet Including Vitamin Dand calcium in your\r\n        diet Avoiding animal protein, salt and caffeine Quitting smoking and avoiding excessive\r\n        alcohol intake Taking medications that reduce the natural\r\n        bone breakdown process Increasing your weight-bearing exercise,\r\n        such as walking or lifting weights."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Again, your healthcare team should advise\r\n    you in regard to these strategies, but you should not hesitate to initiate this discussion\r\n    with them. SEXUALITY Every woman’s image of their body\r\n    and sexuality is unique. No two people have exactly the same response or feelings when\r\n    they learn they have breast cancer. If a mastectomy is performed, this can be overwhelming\r\n    and emotionally difficult for some women. For others, it is a relief to have the cancer\r\n    removed. Treatment for cancer, such as chemotherapy, can cause physical changes that may\r\n    interfere with a woman's sexuality. In addition, breasts are a part of many\r\n    womens' sexual identity. Breasts are symbolic of nurturing, sustaining new life and\r\n    intimacy. The loss of a breast can be threatening to body image and sense of self. If Ihave a mastectomy, will Ibe\r\n    disfigured? Mastectomies today are done to preserve\r\n    muscle, so there is much less disfigurement than there used to be.  It is very\r\n    important that you discuss this topic fully with your surgeons. If you are interested in\r\n    reconstruction, you may want to consider options regarding breast reconstruction at the\r\n    time of your initial surgery. If so, you should be referred to a plastic surgeon for a\r\n    full discussion of your options. In some situations, reconstruction is not advised at the\r\n    time of your initial surgery, but can be done at a later date after all of your cancer\r\n    treatment has been completed. Reconstruction can also be chosen years down the road. What if Ichoose not to have\r\n    reconstruction? If you wish to use one, external breast\r\n    prosthetics (breast forms) are available to help minimize the visual alteration of losing\r\n    a breast. There are many different options available to you. You might want to consider\r\n    this, too, when deciding about surgery and potential reconstruction options.  (Also\r\n    see the section on Reconstruction in After\r\n    the Diagnosis in this directory). Will my sex life be different after breast cancer? Chemotherapy for breast cancer can sometime cause a woman to go into\r\n    premature, or early, menopause. This can be difficult for a woman physically, emotionally\r\n    and sexually. The symptoms of early menopause are sometime more severe than those that\r\n    occur with natural menopause. These symptoms can include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and\r\n    low sexual desire, as well as depression, anxiety and increased irritability. Other\r\n    menopausal issues include increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Are there solutions to the sexual problems Imight face? The good news is that there are solutions for these problems. Hot\r\n    flashes can be treated with specific drugs prescribed by a doctor. Some women also have\r\n    found Vitamin Eor soy products to be helpful. Vaginal dryness can be improved by the liberal use of a lubricant such\r\n    as Lubrin, K-Y Jelly, Ortho Personal Lubricant, Surgilube, Today Personal Lubricant or\r\n    Astroglide. Replens, a vaginal moisturizer, can be used three times a week. Recent studies\r\n    have found that both Estrace, a estrogen cream used vaginally, or Estring, a vaginal ring\r\n    with slow release of estrogen, restore the vaginal tissues without increasing estrogen in\r\n    the rest of the body.  Ask your doctor about these options. Persistent, low sexual desire is sometimes treated with androgens. You\r\n    can have your hormone levels checked and discuss this option with a doctor. Other ways of\r\n    increasing desire are reading erotic literature or watching erotic videos. Almost all\r\n    women who were orgasmic before cancer treatment can be so again although sometimes it\r\n    takes relearning and practice. If needed, doctors can also prescribe therapies that address other\r\n    menopausal issues (depression, anxiety, irritability, increased risk of heart disease and\r\n    osteoporosis). Several new, improved therapies are now available. See the publications and organizations in Resources below\r\n    for more help with managing menopausal symptoms. How will my spouse or lover feel about me\r\n    after surgery? It is very important that you discuss\r\n    this with your partner. Open, honest communication about your feelings and theirs is very\r\n    beneficial to your overall sense of well being and the intimacy you experience before and\r\n    after treatment. Your healthcare team may include a social worker or psychologist who can\r\n    specifically help you to address your feelings and fears regarding sexuality and intimacy.\r\n    Your acceptance of your body changes will affect how others react to you.  It is\r\n    important for you to be open about your feelings to yourself and to your spouse, lover or\r\n    partner. Always remember that who you are has\r\n    nothing to do with your breasts (although perhaps they may have played a part in your\r\n    self-esteem or sexual identity prior to your surgery).  You are special no matter\r\n    what the size of shape of your body, and you deserve to be in an open, honest and loving\r\n    relationship with someone who cares about you--and accepts you--because of who you are in\r\n    your heart, mind and soul. I'm single and not in a relationship.\r\n      How and when do Itell someone new in my life about my breast cancer and surgery? This is not a question with any easy\r\n    answers, but there are some things you can consider when you find yourself in a new\r\n    relationship:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "First, have you reached your own\r\n        personal level of acceptance of your body and your experience with breast cancer? Have you accepted the possible changes\r\n        to your body which might later be issues in a relationship, such as early menopause\r\n        and inability to bear children, or possibility of recurrence? Are you comfortable enough with\r\n        yourself and your experience to share it with someone else? Decide whether this new person is one\r\n        who would be caring and sensitive to your needs. Are you comfortable enough to open\r\n        yourself up and share it with this person? If not, then perhaps either the timing is not\r\n        right or the person is not the one for you. Only you can decide whether you are\r\n        ready to enter into a new relationship with someone. And you alone are the only person who\r\n        can know whether you feel comfortable and \"safe enough\" in a new relationship to\r\n        share your feelings, your experience and your body."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "RESOURCES Organizations American Cancer Society, Inc.

There are correspondingly \r\n        fewer perceived problems associated with eutrophication compared with \r\n        lowland England. However, nutrient enrichment arising from sewage inputs \r\n        and agriculture does cause water quality problems in all types of aquatic \r\n        environment, affecting drinking water supplies, conservation interests \r\n        and recreational uses. Anumber of water-supply reservoirs are regularly affected by blue-green algal blooms \r\n        notably Llandegfedd, Wentwood, Cefni and Nant-y-Frith, with implications \r\n        for water treatment and supply. Conservation interests are being affected \r\n        at a number of important wetland sites on Anglesey, at Bosherston Lakes \r\n        in south Pembrokeshire and at Llangorse Lake near Brecon. Eutrophication \r\n        is affecting the survival of two endangered fish species: the gwyniad \r\n        in Llyn Tegid and the arctic charr in Llyn Padarn. Blooms of blue-green \r\n        algae can interfere with recreational activities at \r\n        a number of waters, including Llysyfran Reservoir and Eglwys Nunydd. Despite \r\n        the environmental safeguards to deal with the consequences of eutrophication \r\n        specified in the Cardiff Bay Barrage Act, algal blooms are likely to affect \r\n        recreational uses and aesthetic enjoyment within the impoundment. The \r\n        Wye below Hereford and the Loughor below Garnswllt STW have been designated \r\n        as sensitive areas under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. In \r\n        both stretches, phosphate inputs from sewage works have been shown to \r\n        promote plant growth which may cause serious de-oxygenation \r\n        during the night under conditions of high \r\n        temperature and low river flow. Resulting low concentrations of dissolved \r\n        oxygen have been implicated in fish mortalities on the lower Loughor in \r\n        1984, 1990 and 1995. Besides these designations, there are many smaller \r\n        watercourses in lowland areas which are affected by growths of algae. \r\n        These effects appear to be chiefly related to inputs of nutrients from \r\n        agricultural sources and may reduce the survival of salmonid eggs and \r\n        fry in heavily affected stretches. In general, scientific understanding of the \r\n        links between nutrient inputs and eutrophication in estuarine and coastal \r\n        waters is much less advanced than for freshwaters. Nevertheless, eutrophication \r\n        appears to be connected with periodic low concentrations of dissolved \r\n        oxygen in the Loughor and Dee estuaries. The impoundment created by \r\n        the Tawe Barrage in Swansea is subject to blooms of marine algae, and \r\n        the impoundment has already been designated as a sensitive area. Historical \r\n        records indicate that algal blooms in coastal waters have been a periodic \r\n        natural occurrence. However, the concentration of blooms of Phaeocystis \r\n        between Liverpool Bay and the Menai Strait in north Wales, around Aberystwyth \r\n        and in Carmarthen Bay suggest an influence of enhanced nutrient inputs \r\n        in these areas arising from sewage, agricultural run-off and industrial \r\n        discharges. Concentrations of nutrients and algae in the Irish Sea have \r\n        risen steadily since the 1960s, so this problem appears to be increasing. \r\n        Foams and scums arising from blooms are aesthetically unpleasant, can \r\n        be mistaken for sewage and give rise to numerous public complaints over \r\n        bathing water quality. Blooms of toxic marine algae are relatively \r\n        rare around the Welsh coast although blooms of the dinoflagellate Gyrodinium \r\n        aureolum have been linked to fish and shellfish mortalities in Swansea \r\n        Bay in 1989 and St. Brides Bay, Pembrokeshire in 1994. Other blooms of \r\n        potentially toxic alga include the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense which has been recorded in the upper part of Milford Haven since 1995, \r\n        and a bloom of Dinophysis was recorded within the Tawe impoundment in \r\n        1995. The former can produce Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning and the latter \r\n        Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning, but no effects on human health have been \r\n        observed to date."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Synthetic \r\n        chemicals"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The distribution of individual synthetic \r\n        chemicals in the Welsh environment reflects their physical and chemical \r\n        properties, and the way in which they are dispersed. The \r\n        persistent substances are poorly soluble in water but soluble in fat. \r\n        They therefore attach to sediment particles, accumulate in the fatty tissues \r\n        of animals, and pose the greatest risk to animals at the top of food chains. \r\n        In freshwater these are fish-or insect-eating aquatic birds and aquatic \r\n        mammals, such as otters, and in the marine environment seals, porpoises, \r\n        dolphins and seabirds are at greatest risk. Clearly humans are also at \r\n        potential risk from the consumption of contaminated wild animals. The \r\n        techniques for monitoring distribution and measuring the \r\n        effect of these chemicals are difficult and expensive. Consequently only \r\n        the apparent high priority chemicals have received attention so far, and \r\n        techniques are still being developed for many groups of synthetic pollutants. PCBs PCBs have been found to be present in freshwater eel tissue at sites throughout Wales, \r\n        but highest concentrations were found in the lower reaches of industrialised \r\n        catchments in the south-east and north 30 . \r\n        Aerial inputs derived from global sources may also be a \r\n        significant route for PCBs found in dipper eggs (an insectiverous riverine \r\n        bird) at remote rural sites 31 . In the marine environment, contamination \r\n        is related to past industrial production, use, disposal and subsequent \r\n        transport with fine sediment. Marine sediments are heavily \r\n        contaminated close to river mouths and docks in \r\n        the Severn Estuary/Bristol channel, contaminated at offshore sites in \r\n        the Severn Estuary and Swansea Bay, and \r\n        slightly contaminated in the centre of the Bristol Channel 32 . \r\n        Although fish from Cardigan Bay and the Severn \r\n        Estuary do not appear to be seriously contaminated, high \r\n        concentrations have been found in marine mammals from \r\n        these locations. This appears to be evidence of high accumulation in predators \r\n        at a considerable distance from PCB \r\n        sources. Dioxins The greatest risk of contamination by dioxins/furans \r\n        is near potential sources such as waste \r\n        incinerators. The Welsh Office commissioned a study of dioxins/furans \r\n        and PCBs in the environment around the high-temperature incineration plant \r\n        of Rechem at Pontypool in 1991 33 . \r\n        With the exception of a localised area within 500m of the plant, measured \r\n        concentrations of PCBs and dioxins/furans in the \r\n        environment provided little evidence of levels of contamination any different \r\n        from those encountered in similar areas elsewhere in the UK. The effects \r\n        of this plant should not give rise to undue concern, according to accepted \r\n        criteria and guidance on health effects for these \r\n        compounds. Pesticides Organochlorine pesticides were used for a \r\n        wide range of applications in Wales, sheep dipping and wool preparation \r\n        being the main rural use. Use of dieldrin and DDT in the UK was banned \r\n        in the late 1980s, but significant residues of these pesticides remain \r\n        in eels from agriculture-intensive and industrialised catchments. In the \r\n        marine environment they are still found in the fatty tissues of marine \r\n        mammals, and an inshore Cardigan Bay sediment sample contained the highest \r\n        level of dieldrin contamination of all sites in a national survey 35 . \r\n        Pentachlorophenol was synthesised in Wales and is still found in the discharge \r\n        from the manufacturing site, although production ceased many years ago. \r\n        Residues remain in sediments surrounding the discharge, and a slight effect \r\n        on the invertebrate community there is evident. The biological impacts \r\n        of organophosphate and synthetic pyrethroids are covered in Section \r\n        4.2. PAHs Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that \r\n        result from combustion of fossil fuels and waste material are found widely \r\n        in industrialised areas, in road run-off and in marine sediments close \r\n        to shorelines. Many are moderately persistent in the environment, but \r\n        are broken down in fish and higher vertebrate animals. They can cause \r\n        the same sorts of cellular effects as PCBs and dioxins. Organotin Use of tributyltin (TBT) antifouling paint \r\n        on boats less than 25m in length ceased in 1987, and the application and \r\n        removal of such paints on boats of 25m or more became subject to regulation \r\n        in 1996. Evidence of impact on the affected species (dog whelk) is limited \r\n        to parts of Milford Haven and Holyhead harbour, close to current sources \r\n        of TBT on large vessels 35 . \r\n        Organotin compounds have been used in other applications and their well-documented \r\n        endocrine disruptive effect may require further assessment."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Radioactivity"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Surveys \r\n        in Wales show that the average radon concentration in Welsh homes is 20 \r\n        becquerels/cubic metre, equivalent to about half of the total radioactive \r\n        dose received by the population 36 . \r\n        Radon levels are higher than this average in parts of Glamorgan, Pembrokeshire, \r\n        Radnorshire, Anglesey and north-east Wales due to the underlying geology. \r\n        More extensive areas with high radon concentrations occur elsewhere in \r\n        the UK such as Cornwall and parts of north-east Scotland. Raised levels \r\n        of radon gas increase the risks of \r\n        lung cancer and the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has \r\n        advised that indoor radon above an Action Level of 200 bequerels/cubic \r\n        metre should be reduced. It has been estimated that Wales has about 10,000 \r\n        homes with radon levels above this level. In June 1998, the Welsh Office announced \r\n        a targeted testing programme for four areas at the highest risk from radon \r\n        gas emitted by natural sources. Householders in these areas can receive \r\n        detectors from the NRPB to monitor radon gas in their properties over \r\n        a three-month period. The need for measures to reduce levels will then be evaluated. Grants to assist in this \r\n        work may be available from local authorities. New homes are protected \r\n        through the building requirements in high-radon areas. The results of extensive monitoring of the \r\n        effects of nuclear facilities on levels of radiation in the environment \r\n        are reported annually by MAFF. This includes an assessment of the maximum \r\n        exposure to radiation to humans from each source. For terrestrial sources, these assessments are generally based \r\n        on concentrations in agricultural produce local to the nuclear facility. \r\n        For aquatic foodstuffs, the assessment is based on concentrations in species \r\n        commonly harvested for human consumption. The \r\n        calculation of the dose received is based on consumers with the highest \r\n        potential intake of the food in question 37 . \r\n        The exposure from each of the nuclear facilities in Wales was a small \r\n        percentage of the maximum limit (1 millisievert) for members of the public \r\n        from artificial sources of radiation ( Figure \r\n        4.20 ). Monitoring in 1998 of the impact of the discharges \r\n        from Amersham in Cardiff established that there were relatively high concentrations \r\n        of tritium in flounders (up to 50,000 bequerels/kilogram) caught near \r\n        the effluent discharge from the plant and also in sediments within the \r\n        Severn Estuary. Previously it had been assumed, in accordance with other \r\n        studies, that concentrations in fish would be similar to that of ambient \r\n        seawater. The finding that tritium could be bioaccumulated required a \r\n        reassessment of the radiation dose to the critical group of fish consumers \r\n        in Cardiff, and the 1997 figure of 3% has been revised to 6%. This is \r\n        still a small proportion of the dose limit but nevertheless the unexpected \r\n        bioaccumulation of tritium was of concern and resulted in a requirement \r\n        for tritium discharges to be reduced significantly (see Section \r\n        5.7) . Asurvey was undertaken in 1997 to determine \r\n        the concentration of technetium-99 in selected animals and plants around \r\n        the Welsh coast. Highest concentrations (1836 bequerels/kilogram) were \r\n        found in brown seaweed at sites closest to the Sellafield discharge along \r\n        the north Wales coast. Concentrations decreased southwards with lowest \r\n        amounts present at sites in the Bristol Channel. The highest concentration found in periwinkles \r\n        in the same survey was 152 bequerels/kilogram. \r\n        This is not a high concentration in relation to the risk to human health \r\n        since consumption of 12 kilograms would result in a radiation dose of \r\n        1 microsievert, which is only 0.1% of the dose \r\n        limit."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Acid rain"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Nitrogen \r\n        now contributes 60% and sulphur 40% of the total acidifying input from \r\n        atmospheric deposition in the UK. Some 40% of nitrogen deposition is oxidised \r\n        nitrogen from the combustion of fossil fuels, while 60% takes the form \r\n        of ammonia, mainly from agricultural sources within the country 38 . \r\n        Impacts by acidification from nitrogen and \r\n        sulphur emissions can be assessed by the critical loads approach, which \r\n        shows where deposition rates of atmospheric pollution are high enough \r\n        to cause environmental harm. This demonstrates that acidity critical loads \r\n        for soils and freshwater systems are widely exceeded by the combination \r\n        of nitrogen and sulphur deposition 39 , 40 ( Figure \r\n        4.21 ). Cuts in sulphur emissions have reduced deposition \r\n        in upland Wales from 3050 kg/ha/year in 1984 to 2030 kg/ha/year in 1995. \r\n        Cuts in emissions of oxidised nitrogen have also contributed to reducing \r\n        the affected area, but substantial further progress is needed 25 . \r\n        The effects of reductions to date are apparent in declining sulphate concentrations \r\n        and slight reductions in the acidity of 77 streams surveyed in 1984 and \r\n        1995.

The position was rewarding and the company was a great place to work. Iwas devastated and jumped at the first job opportunity that came my way. Iwasn't thrilled with the job but Iworked hard and was rewarded with salary increases, bonuses, and company perks during my three years of employment. Last month, Ifound myself standing in the unemployment line again. Although both layoffs were due to poor business climates and not performance, Ifeel embarrassed and discouraged. Ihave stellar references from both employers, including the managers who made the layoff decisions, but Iam concerned about what future employers may think. Ialso wonder if Imay be in the wrong profession since Ihave been dispensable to two employers. Do you have any suggestions as to how Ican handle the interview process to put a more positive spin on the situation?"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "You are faced with a common situation in today's job market. Many companies are downsizing and cutting strong performers like yourself. It is evident that you were highly valued by both companies. What is important for you to internalize is that your position was eliminated for business, not personal reasons. Remember to reflect on the key strengths and benefits you brought the company. You raise the uncomfortable feelings of how to explain your job loss to a future employer. Prepare a ''reason for leaving'' statement. You want to develop a statement that is truthful and acceptable to your previous and prospective employer. Keep it short, factual, and positive. Irecommend a three-part story: Background: Abrief and positive description of your role and responsibilities. Facts: The company faced an economic downturn and your position was eliminated. Moving forward: Therefore, you are looking to utilize your skills in a new position. As a result of the layoff, you seem to be questioning if you are working in the wrong profession. It sounds like you jumped too quickly into your second job without evaluating the fit. Consider this as a good time to do some self-assessment. You can start by looking at the skills you most enjoyed in your positions and ask for feedback from colleagues. Then you could explore other interest areas through networking. Since you are at a turning point, you may want to consider career coaching so that you can make a good decision in your next position. IT workers may need to reevaluate careers I'm one of the many IT workers who have been out of work in my field for a very long time. Ihad not planned a career change as Ienjoyed what Iwas doing. However, I'm really starting to wonder if it's time to think about doing something else. Ijust don't feel from what Iread about outsourcing that the IT sector will recover. What are your thoughts? Offshore outsourcing is a growing phenomenon affecting technology professionals who remain underemployed or out of work, like yourself. Although some areas in IT are expected to rebound as the economy strengthens, outsourcing to India and Southeast Asia has caused great competition for existing industry positions. According to market research firm, Gartner Inc., business process offshoring is expected to reach $1.8 billion in 2003 on a global basis, representing a 38 percent increase from the previous year. Two years is a long time to be out of work. Such a hiatus from the workplace is worthy of a serious reevaluation of your IT career. The field has been hit hard but there are some opportunities that are beginning to open up depending on expertise. As a starting point, determine what skills you have that tap into the current market needs for IT specialists. If your skill set is valued, then you need to evaluate your job search strategy. Ask yourself: How and where did you deliver value in your previous job? What did you contribute that made your business group successful? How current is your skill base? It's also worth exploring whether you have the required qualifications and skills the market demands. You may want to pursue further education or training to broaden your experience. What other skills and knowledge do you have? For example, do you have experience with administrative IT programs in project management, payroll, or accounting systems? These skills may help you present yourself to other industries. If you have an understanding of an industry sector and its technology needs, then that may be an advantage to you. Ihave seen many IT professionals who have thoroughly scoured the job market with no success and have decided to work as contract consultants or take project-based work assignments on a temporary basis. This allows employers some staffing and cost flexibility. Sometimes these assignments can lead to full-time positions. With all the changes in the market, everyone needs to be current in their field. In addition, we need to understand  outsourcing's impact on business. The nature of work is changing so dramatically that most economists haven't even figured out the implications yet. Although we see the trend of outsourcing IT jobs to some countries and a decrease in these jobs in the United States, it is unclear what the future holds. With any change comes both risk and opportunity. IT professionals may need to focus on the career paths that globalization is creating. If many programming positions have disappeared, consider developing skills in understanding and translating business processes and utilizing project management experience. Doing so might enable  IT professionals to position themselves as the liaison for offshore development projects. To be competitive, IT professionals can no longer rely on their technical expertise solely but need to have expertise in industry specific business practices. They will need to be able to translate business needs to IT practices. Some points to consider as you examine your career options:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Look at your additional skills and become more of a generalist as you will be better positioned if you are skilled in both technology and the business side of IT. Look to smaller organizations. Fortune 500 companies will focus most on offshoring. Start your own consulting business if you have the entrepreneurial spirit. Look into areas of growth such as healthcare and education. Get further education to update skills and retrain. Explore changing career fields through the help of one-stop career centers or career counseling."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Staying, complaining won't help your career Iwill be leaving my current position in about a year. My annual review is in a few weeks. Irecently discovered that someone hired five months ago started at a salary $1,500 a year higher than mine, even though we both have an identical job title and description. Iwas told by my headhunter when the job was offered to me that there would be no negotiation of salary, so Iaccepted the offer as it stood. There are multiple problems at work including rampant turnover, low employee morale, and favoritism on the part of the office manager. Do Iignore the salary imbalance and just say ''good riddance'' to the job when it comes time to move on? Do Iconfront the office manager during my annual review and ask about the disparity in salaries? Do Icontact the firm's human resources manager and discuss the disparity with him? Do Icontact him now or wait to see what is offered at my review? You may want to reevaluate your plan of staying in your present job for one more year. Why are you waiting to leave if you detest your boss and see both an unequal salary as well as limited future growth potential? If you are holding on for one more year in hopes of a higher salary, don't hold your breath. You do not describe any positive actions you have taken. Iwonder what efforts you have made to work more effectively with your boss. Remember, you were hired to provide skills that help your company and it is your job to meet your boss' needs. If the differences are too great, then you have a choice: leave the company. To stay, complain, and hang in there demonstrates an attitude that will not help you progress in your career. Regarding the salary issue, you can always ask for what you think is fair in the negotiation with your hiring manager before accepting the offer. At this point, however, Ithink that raising the salary issue is a waste of your time and may create ill will. In the future, be wary of a headhunter who says there is no negotiation. They are working for the company to fill the job and not necessarily for your best interests. Understand that negotiation is a natural part of developing a win-win situation with a future employer. Iadvise you to view your situation as a learning experience so that moving forward you can proceed at your professional best. Be upfront about need for flexible schedule Iam looking for a 24- or 30-hour-a-week position, and Iam considering applying for positions that are advertised as full time. My hope is being able to negotiate shorter hours, or do job sharing. My field is health services research. Positions are often grant-funded in this field, and Ihave been told that there is often room for flexibility in setting work hours. At what point in the application process should Idisclose that Iam seeking part-time work? The field of health services research may allow for flexibility in scheduling, but my advice is go for the position as advertised so that you do not eliminate yourself up front. In the interview, you can ask about the job expectations to get a fuller picture of the position without hinting that you want part time. Your goal is to interview well, get the job offer, and then have a follow-up meeting where you can negotiate for flex time or reduced hours. Be prepared to share how you will get all the work done within that time frame and how you can be most productive. You are at a much greater advantage to ask for changes after you have received the offer. Since the company offered you the position, they value you above the other applicants and may be willing to accommodate you.

{"file_number": "26", "plaintext": [{"tag": "div", "text": "NEWS: ANALYSIS & COMMENTARY The Budget: Hey Guys, Get Real President Bush says he wants to cut the deficit in half by 2009. Here's why that's not likely to happen Under increasing pressure from conservatives, George W. Bush, a man not known as a penny-pincher, is seeking to make fiscal restraint a centerpiece of his fiscal 2005 budget. After three years of surging deficits, Bush is sounding like an old-school GOP budget hawk. \"With spending restraint and continued pro-growth economic policies, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years,\" he says. Bush's Feb. 2 fiscal blueprint indeed proposes to cut the deficit in half by 2009. And, if it were adopted, it would effectively freeze funding for one high-profile chunk of domestic spending for the next five years. But critics argue that in the end, as they say in Texas, the President is all hat, no cattle. Why? For starters, the budget does nothing to trim massive spending on entitlements, by far the largest chunk of federal spending. Instead, to hit his deficit target, Bush relies on a five-year freeze on the much smaller spending that goes into hundreds of domestic programs, such as law enforcement, environmental protection, housing, and education. FIVE-YEAR PLAN. Yet even that is largely illusory, given that Congress has never accepted that level of restraint. Even less realistic: The budget calls for no additional funding for Iraq and Afghanistan after Sept. 30, even though the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office figures reconstruction of the two war-torn countries could cost $50 billion and continued occupation will cost at least an additional $20 billion a year. Perhaps most misleading, Bush is offering up a five-year budget rather than the traditional 10-year plan. In doing so, he is hiding the long-term costs of last year's Medicare drug law, big future hikes in Pentagon spending for non-Iraq-related projects, and the impact of his latest $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan. Indeed, the President's latest plan includes the $990 billion cost of making his '01 and '03 tax cuts permanent as well as $300 billion in new subsidies for saving and buying health insurance. But less than 20%, or about $200 billion, of the revenue drain will take effect through 2009. The rest will occur in 2010-14 -- meaning ballooning deficits just past the horizon of the five-year budget estimates. So how serious are Congress and the President about deficit reduction? Politicians will come to blows over a handful of fiscal matters in the coming months. Pay special attention to battles over two major bills -- one to build and repair highways, airports, and mass transit; the other a long-awaited energy bill aimed at providing subsidies to domestic producers with the stated goal of reducing reliance on foreign oil. And don't forget the fight over Bush's proposed tax cuts. Capitol Hill conservatives are putting heavy pressure on Bush to restrain spending even more than he has proposed. And, already, rising deficits have opened a major rift within the GOP. On one side, hardliners such as House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) see the deficit as a wedge into the issue they really care about -- shrinking the size of government. On the other, traditional fiscal conservatives such as Senator Olympia J. Snowe (R-Me.) favor government spending for domestic programs but worry about red ink. Then there are the lawmakers whose main concern is protecting home-state projects. The GOP chairmen of both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees are warning that they can't pass Bush's freeze. With an election looming, most Democrats and many Republicans prefer to avoid chopping popular programs. \"It's going to be a very difficult budget year,\" says House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle (R-Okla.). The first test of fiscal credibility will come when Congress acts on a massive six-year transportation bill. House committees favor spending $375 billion. The Senate is debating a $318 billion version. But the Administration warns that Bush will veto any measure that costs more than $256 billion. There is little chance Congress will O.K. less than $285 billion. So in any my-way-or-the-highway showdown with Bush, who has yet to veto any spending bills, bet on the highway to win. Asecond test will come once debate on the long-delayed energy bill starts again. Bush initially asked for $20 billion in production incentives. That has ballooned to $31 billion as a result of added congressional pork. The White House is trying to trim the measure. But unless lawmakers scale it back to $20 billion or less, it will be hard to claim fiscal discipline. Then there are taxes. There's no chance Bush will win approval of his full $1.3 trillion tax package. But GOP lawmakers will push to make permanent a fistful of middle-class breaks that were first adopted in 2001 but due to expire over the next few years. They include marriage-penalty relief, an increase in the child credit, and a temporary fix to the painful alternative minimum tax. But if Congress is serious about deficit reduction, it will have to ditch much of the tax package NICKELS AND DIMES? Already, legislators are looking at finessing the Bush budget. One strategy: delay key spending votes until after the elections. Another idea is to grant Bush's total $800 billion-plus spending request for all nonentitlement programs but shift funds from defense to domestic priorities. Congress would still give Bush the money he wants for the Pentagon -- but in a later supplemental bill of about $50 billion. In the yearend confusion, the President could take credit for holding down spending, while getting all the money he wants for defense. But even if such a strategy succeeds in holding spending down in 2005, it is unlikely to have much impact on long-term deficits. That's because the programs the President wants to freeze represent barely one-fifth of the budget, making his newfound deficit concerns seem illusory at best. Environmental protection, crime prevention, and the like may be important to many Americans, but they don't cost much -- at least not by Washington standards. Of the $2.4 trillion that Bush would spend in '05, these domestic programs account for just $485 billion. \"This is not the problem,\" says Robert L. Bixby, director of the Concord Coalition, an anti-deficit group. The real money is in defense -- which will cost nearly $428 billion next year, even without Iraq -- and the entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. The big three will soak up a staggering $1 trillion next year. And, says the CBO, they will cost more than $1.4 trillion a year by 2010. To put it another way, Washington will be arguing over a mere $10 billion in domestic programs. By contrast, Medicare spending will increase by more than twice that next year -- even before a costly new drug benefit kicks in. \"Spending will not be brought under control until entitlements are seriously reformed,\" says Heritage Foundation budget expert Brian M. Reidl. \"You can't nickel-and-dime your way to balancing the budget.\" Not that $10 billion doesn't matter. And fiscal responsibility needs to start somewhere. But Bush's budget -- and the likely congressional response to it -- will prove to be little more than election-year gamesmanship. It may help Bush, who could claim progress toward fiscal restraint. And it will allow lawmakers to campaign with new ribbons to cut. What the budget gymnastics won't do, however, is reduce the deficit by very much.

My research up to the\r\npresent will be continued, but with modifications in equipment and methods of\r\ndata. The two troops differ since\r\nTroop Iconsists of a family group with four members; the breeding male Corey,\r\nhis son Tomas and daughter Sara, and a non-breeding female named Sissi who is\r\nthe Coreys sister. The mother of\r\nTomas and Sara died while giving birth to Sara. Troop II consists of three unrelated males, with two more unrelated males\r\nwho are currently in isolation to be introduced in the near future. Troop Iis one of only two captive family troops of woolly monkeys in the\r\nworld; the other is located in London, England. The video recordings were analyzed\r\nframe-by-frame using a proprietary video digitization program. The vocalizations were recorded by the video camera as well and analyzed\r\nusing Sound Forge to make sound spectrographs, or sonograms. Aprogrammed Palm Pilot was used to record the movement and behavior of\r\nboth troops in order to make ethograms to display patterns of behavior and\r\nvocalization. The following was anticipated: 1. vocalizations\r\nwould be correlated with visual displays; 2. display function would be\r\nidentified through context; 3 individuals would be identified through harmonics\r\nin the sonograms; 4. the behavior and vocalizations of the two troops would\r\ndiffer; and 5. the behavioral analysis would be useful for maintaining and\r\nbreeding captive troops. Introduction The common woolly monkey ( Lagothrix\r\nlagothricha ), also known as Humboldt's woolly monkey, is found only in South\r\nAmerica in the Amazon River Basin of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and\r\nVenezuela. They range in all canopy levels of primary rainforest as well\r\nas gallery forests, and have been found in mountainous areas and cloud forests\r\nup to 3,000 meters. The\r\nclassification of the common woolly monkey is as follows:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Taxon Classification Kingdom Animalia Phylum Chordata Class Mammalia Order Primates Suborder Haplorrhini Family Cebidae Subfamily Atelinae Genus Lagothrix Species lagothricha"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The morphology of the common woolly monkey is similar to that of other\r\nmonkeys in the Atelinae subfamily. The\r\nwoolly monkey is the largest monkey in South America, with the female weight\r\naveraging 11 pounds and the male weight averaging 15 pounds. They have a prehensile tail that can support their full\r\nweight and is used for feeding and locomotion. Woolly monkeys can have dark brown, pale brown, dark gray, pale gray,\r\nreddish-brown, or black fur. The\r\nlimbs, tail, and head are usually darker than the back, with the face being\r\nblack and the palms of the hands and feet being pink. Slight sexual dimorphism exists including the canines, body, and head in\r\nthe males being longer than females. However,\r\nthe female's tail is longer than the male's and the female's clitoris is longer\r\nthan the males' penis, which sometimes makes it difficult to determine the sex\r\nin the wild. Humboldt's woolly monkey is primarily frugivorous, but they also feed on\r\nleaves, seeds, flowers, and some invertebrates and small mammals. In captivity they have been known to prey upon birds that fly\r\ninto their cages. The group size\r\nfor woolly monkeys averages 10-12 group members, but much larger groups are\r\nknown to exist. Subgroups sometimes\r\nform and travel independently from the larger group. Woolly monkeys are not territorial and allow group ranges to overlap and\r\nhave been known to forage alongside each other as well as other species in their\r\nfamily. The woolly monkey travels\r\nthrough the forest quadrupedally using its tail as a fifth arm. They rarely come down to the ground and, therefore, are known to be\r\nalmost totally arboreal. They even sleep 150 feet above the ground in the canopy. When on the ground, which is especially rare in the wild, they walk\r\nbipedally, using their arms and tail to balance. The tail is extremely important and is always anchored to something; it\r\nis used to pick up objects and sometimes even allows the monkeys to rest by\r\nhanging from just the tail. The social structure of the common woolly\r\nmonkey is a multi-male-multi-female group in which a hierarchy exists between\r\nthe males in the group. The\r\ndominance hierarchy is determined by play-fighting and age. The species' mating system is polygamous because each receptive female\r\nmates with every male in the group, with the most dominant males receiving the\r\nmost copulations. Because of this,\r\nthe male that succeeds in passing on his genes is the one that releases more and\r\nbetter-fit sperm per session, with multiple sessions increasing the likelihood. Therefore, every male mates with every female, but only one female is\r\ncopulated with at any given time. In\r\naddition to receiving the most copulations, the most dominant males also receive\r\nthe most social grooming and are known to protect mothers and their infants from\r\nothers in the group. In general,\r\nadult and subadult males are dominant over all other members in the group. Male woolly monkeys are philopatric, which means that the males stay in\r\nthe group in which they were born, known as their natal group, while the females\r\nleave their natal group. Female\r\ndispersion usually occurs between the ages of five and a half years to six\r\nyears, the same ages that females begin to mate. Although females begin to mate between those ages, they remain sterile\r\nand do not conceive until one to three years after they leave their natal\r\ngroups. The gestation period\r\naverages seven and a half months, or about 223 days, and the female gives birth\r\nto one young about every two to three years during the birthing season, which\r\noccurs between the months of August and December. After birth, the infants nurse from sixteen to twenty months, traveling\r\nindependently by six months. Little research on woolly monkeys exists, with the majority of the\r\nresearch focused on ecology, morphology, location, social structure, and so on. Research on the behavior and vocalizations of the common woolly monkey is\r\nalmost completely nonexistent. The\r\nresearch on woolly monkey behavior and vocalization that has been done was\r\nperformed by M. Ramirez and published through the World Wildlife Fund in 1988. His research was made into a \"dictionary\" that explained the\r\nbehavior or reason behind each vocalization, which he spelled out using human\r\nphonetics. He also explained some\r\nof the woolly monkeys' visual communication. Although thorough in some respects, his research did not investigate\r\nsequences of behavior and vocalization or analyze each individual separately\r\nwith respect to behavior and vocalization sequences. Methods My research on the common woolly monkey was\r\nconducted at the Louisville Zoo, one of only two places in the world that have a\r\ncaptive family troop. After being\r\nformally introduced to the monkeys by the head veterinarian, Iwas able to begin\r\ncollecting data. Before starting\r\nthe data collection process, Idecided to spend a few weeks observing the two\r\ntroops in order to become acquainted with the individuals. During the three weeks of strict observation, Itook notice of each\r\nbehavior and began compiling a list of the observed behaviors. This list is located in the results and discussion section. Ialso realized that not only could Itell the monkeys apart visually,\r\nbut vocally as well. After becoming familiar with the behaviors (displays) and\r\nvocalizations of the monkeys, Ibegan collecting data. The data collection consisted of a variety of\r\nmethods including the use of an 8 mm video camera to record behaviors, a mini\r\ndisk recorder to record the vocalizations, and a proprietary Palm Pilot program\r\nto record the movement and behavior of each individual in the two troops as well\r\nas the overall behavior of each troop. At\r\nfirst, Ivideotaped the woolly monkeys individually. This method was not effective because the behavior of the other woolly\r\nmonkeys could not be seen and the monkeys move extremely fast and it is\r\ndifficult to follow them around the cage. Ithen tried to videotape sections of the cage, but that did not work well either\r\nbecause Icould not differentiate between the monkeys because of the cameras\r\nbad resolution. After four hours of\r\nrecording over one month, Irealized that Ineeded a much better video camera in\r\norder to continue with the research. For\r\nmy future research Iwill have a video camera with superior resolution. The video recordings that Ihad were used to learn and practice the\r\ndigitization process. The\r\nrecordings were digitized and transferred to compact disk for later analysis. The digitized version of the video recordings could be\r\nanalyzed at 1/10 of a second, with the potential advantages including the\r\nability to record the behavior at set intervals, allowing the viewer to record\r\nthe behavior of all the monkeys in view. The mini disk recorder was used in conjunction\r\nwith the video camera. Iexperienced multiple difficulties and problems with the mini disk recorder that\r\neventually led me to discontinue using it in this project. This will be discussed further in the results and discussion section. Because Idid not have any vocalizations recorded, Idecided to use the\r\nsound from the video recordings for my vocalization analysis. Sound Forge, a computer program used for the sound analysis, enabled me\r\nto make sound spectrographs, or sonograms, on the woolly monkey vocalizations. In order to analyze just the woolly monkey vocalizations and not all of\r\nthe background noise, adjustment was required. With Sound Forge, Iwas able to\r\ndelete all of the outside and background noise that included crickets, birds,\r\ntrains, human voices, and so on. The proprietary Palm Pilot program used for recording the behaviors was\r\ncalled Pen Recorder and the program used to analyze the recordings was called\r\nPen Reviewer. Below are diagrams of\r\nPen Recorder, Pen Reviewer, and View Data. When\r\nusing Pen Recorder, Ihad to designate letters of the alphabet to the observed\r\nbehaviors. Once Istarted Pen\r\nRecorder, Iwrote the letter of every behavior that Iobserved an individual\r\ndoing until they went inside or went to sleep. This method was difficult because it was impossible to keep up with the\r\nbehaviors while having to remember which letter went with which behavior as well\r\nas write the letter and then keep going. The\r\ncollected data was viewed in Pen Reviewer under View Data, displayed above, and\r\nthen analyzed in the form of a graph, time line, and matrix, displayed below. After\r\nusing this technique for a while, Idecided to change my method of recording\r\nbecause of the above stated reason as well as the fact that certain monkeys were\r\nmore active than the others and Ihad to start and stop recording for the\r\ndifferent individuals, which does not heed good results for analysis. For my further research, Iwill be using a new method of recording\r\nbehaviors. Instead of using the\r\nproprietary Palm Pilot program, Iwill be using a tablet PC with a voice\r\nrecognition program so Ican just speak each behavior as it occurs. Results &\r\nDiscussion The individual woolly monkeys of Troop Ieach\r\nhave extremely different personalities, rank, age, relationships, etc. The family troop consists of four related individuals:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Name Birth Date Age Corey 11/13/91 11\r\n      years Sissi 09/29/95 7\r\n      years & 2 months Tomas 12/01/98 3\r\n      years & 11 months Sara 12/07/00 1\r\n      year & 11 months"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Corey Sissi Sara Tomas Corey is the dominant breeding male and is father to both Sara and Tomas. Sissi is Corey's sister and is the dominant non-breeding female. Sissi has never had any offspring and is considered sterile. The position of the second most dominant member of the troop is currently\r\nbeing fought over between Sissi and Tomas. Because Tomas is a subadult male and Sissi is an adult\r\nfemale, he and Sissi fight over everything, from food to where to sleep. Thomas and Sara are siblings and fight and play in ways similar to human\r\nsiblings, but still show affection quite often, grooming each other and resting\r\nnext to each other. Tomas and his father Corey appear to have the closest relationship within\r\nthe group. Tomas follows Corey\r\naround, mimicking certain behaviors. When\r\nTomas and Sara are resting together or grooming each other, Corey generally\r\njoins them. Strange to human\r\nviewers, the family troop members are sexual with each other, especially Corey\r\nand Tomas and Corey and Sara. Sexuality\r\nbetween family members is surprisingly common in the primate world. According to primate research, it is quite normal for a father and son to\r\nfeel on each other's genitals and have erections when around one another. These behaviors are considered greetings and are meant to establish\r\nfriendly contact, usually occurring between adult males and juveniles of both\r\nsexes. During my observations, Inoticed that Corey and Sissi rarely interact, while the same is true for Sara\r\nand Sissi. The monkeys in the family troop have differing personalities, with Corey\r\nas the alpha male. He is the\r\nlargest monkey, with huge canines and constant eye movement that indicates a\r\nneurological disorder, though not apparent in any other way. Corey never plays and is always pacing the cage, eating,\r\ngrooming himself or others, staring at outside disturbances, or resting. Only after about a month of observation Corey appeared not to consider me\r\nan outside threat anymore, showing behaviors indicating a friendly greeting and\r\nthen calming down other group members through appeasement behaviors. This meant that Icould now observe their behavior undisturbed by\r\noutsiders. Tomas is more of a loner\r\nfor the majority of the time; shy toward outsiders, he never makes eye contact\r\nwith me, which is unlike all the others in the group. When not off by himself, Tomas is playing or play fighting with Sara,\r\nfighting with Sissi, or grooming or resting with Corey and/or Sara. Corey\r\nstaring Tomas hiding Sissi & Tomas Sissi\r\nwalking Sara eating fighting Sissi is the most unsocial member of the group, only interacting with the\r\nothers when fighting with Tomas. She\r\nis, however, active toward me, cage shaking, which is a sign that she feels\r\nthreatened, and intense staring sessions at me, most likely indicating that she\r\ndoes not approve of my presence. When\r\nnot interacting with Tomas or me, Sissi rests high up in the top of the cage,\r\nfar away from everything and everyone else. Sara on the other hand is the most active and social member of the group. Sara is always doing something, whether watching me, playing with Tomas,\r\nresting with Corey and/or Tomas, eating, playing by herself with toys, or just\r\nrunning around bipedally on the cage floor. The youngest, most curious and loving of the group, she is the one that\r\nhas tried to make contact with me the most and is the most affectionate toward\r\nothers.

These\r\ncommon sounds included shrieks, squeaks, and grunts. Ithen performed a spectrum analysis, an option in Sound Forge, in order to view\r\nthe vocalizations in the form of a sound spectrograph. Although this analysis is not yet complete, it will be continued in the\r\nfuture. After more spectrographs\r\nare made and analyzed, Iwill be able to differentiate between individuals just\r\nby looking at their sonograms because it is my hypothesis that each individual\r\nproduces different sound spectrographs although they make the same\r\nvocalizations.

Among the most interesting and best known to aquarists is the elaborate\r\n    courtship of cichlid fishes. Typically a male develops a territory which he defends from\r\n    all intruders. Many species also build nests, which might be elaborate sand castles, or\r\n    excavations with tunnels or burrows, or may simply be a cleaned part of the rocky or sandy\r\n    area in which the territory is held. Once the tasks of developing a territory and building\r\n    a nest are complete the male is ready to invite females to his nest to spawn. Eager males\r\n    may attempt to do this even before the nest is complete, but they are nearly always\r\n    refused as the female does not get all the correct messages if the nest is not there. One\r\n    of the reasons for this is that part of the courtship ritual includes the nest, and each\r\n    nest type is species-specific; it is a characteristic of the species that is important to\r\n    mate recognition and the acceptance of the correct partner. The initial invitation is ‘side-shake’ during which the male\r\n    approaches a female, extends his fins and flexes so that the anal fin, which usually has\r\n    attractive spots and colours on it, towards the female. If the female is interested the\r\n    male then turns away and facing the spawning site beats its tail in a movement inviting\r\n    the female to follow (‘follow-shake’). If the female is still interested, then\r\n    with exaggerated, undulating movements the male leads the female to the spawning site\r\n    (lead-swim). Once in the nest or spawning site, the couple circle each other, perform a\r\n    variety of shakes (nest shake, vertical nest shake etc) and gently nudge each other till\r\n    the female lays eggs. The female then picks up the eggs in her mouth, sometimes doing so\r\n    before the male has had time to fertilise them. This would be a waste of eggs, so to solve\r\n    the problem the males of many species have dummy eggs on the anal fin. This fin is spread\r\n    out in front of the female to display the egg dummies and curled slightly to hold\r\n    spermatozoa that he will release. The female tries to pick the egg dummies from the male\r\n    anal fin and in doing so collects spermatozoa, that fertilise the eggs in her mouth. The\r\n    need to collect the eggs before they are fertilised arose from the fact that eggs are\r\n    often stolen almost as soon as they appear by other fishes which feed upon them. Another\r\n    problem is that males that do not have territories, and were not chosen as mates by the\r\n    female, try to sneak spawnings by darting down between the spawning couple and fertilising\r\n    eggs that are exposed. By collecting the eggs promptly, the efforts of robbers and\r\n    sneakers are largely circumvented. Once in the mouth the eggs develop into young fish that remain there\r\n    until they are ready to feed for themselves. Most cichlids will then look after their\r\n    young for sometime (a few days to four or more weeks), taking them into their mouths when\r\n    there is a threat from predators. The fry are also taken into the mouth at night for\r\n    safekeeping. Once the fry are independent they leave the care of the mother. Some cichlids\r\n    behave as cuckoos; they give their fry to another species to care for. It seems that the\r\n    foster parent can recognise the foreign young, but she is unable to chase them away or\r\n    swallow them as both activities will endanger her own brood. Chasing foreign fry that are\r\n    mixed tightly in a school with ones own fry is not possible without chasing away the own\r\n    fry too. Similarly, how does the mother swallow foreign fry and not her own?"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Submitted by: Dr Tony Ribbink"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Email:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "A.Ribbink@ru.ac.za"}]}

Since Napster was introduced in 2000, there have been a succession of file-swapping software programs.  At all times, there was always one program that dominated the others in searches.  First it was Napster, which ended as the #3 term of 2001.  When the government took Napster down, that led to the rise of Morpheus , the #5 term of 2002.  Then Morpheus had troubles and was replaced as the dominant software by the capitalization-challenged KaZaA and its spyware-free cousin, KaZaA Lite. KaZaA shot up the Lycos 50 in mid-2002 and ended last year as the #64 term of 2002.  This year, it spent 15 weeks as the number one search term on our weekly list and only dropped out of the top five for two weeks during the Iraq War when The Lycos 50 was dominated by war-related search terms.  During 2003, KaZaA received twice as many searches as all other file-swapping softwares put together.  Only one other file swapper, WinMX (#86), makes the top 100.  Napster falls from #49 to #165, while Audiogalaxy , which was #74 for 2002, falls out of the top 500 terms. Dragonball falls from two straight years at #1 to the #3 spot, and in between comes the resurgent Britney Spears at #2.  Actually, Britney had fallen out of the weekly top ten by the middle of 2003, but in August she climbed back to the top following a succession of publicity stunts generating oodles of queries from curious Lycos users.  Between her topless photos on the covers of Elle Magazine (U.K. edition) and Rolling Stone , her bottomless photo on the cover of Esquire and most significantly, her kiss with Madonna (#84) during the MTV Video Music Awards, Web users were searching for Britney one more time. 2003 was also a very significant year for huge stories that dominated Internet traffic for weeks at a time.  The two biggest stories we have tracked since we began the Lycos 50 in 1999 were the September 11 terrorist attacks and the 2000 election and recount, but the next three biggest events -- if you count searches over a two- to three-week period -- all occurred in 2003.  They were the War in Iraq (#15), the rape allegation against NBA star Kobe Bryant (#6), and the Paris Hilton sex tape. (#4) March and April saw Lycos inundated for searches related to the war.  This was a more conventionally fought war than the one in Afghanistan last year, and for the first time in history people could follow the news of the war in real time through the Internet.  In particular, people at offices without access to television used the Internet to keep up to date on the latest news.  The Internet also significantly changed the way people followed the Iraq War because of the availability of foreign news sources offering differing opinions of the actions taken by the United States.  Lycos users searched for newspapers from around the world, such as Le Monde , Arab News , and The Jerusalem Post . By far the most-searched news source from outside the United States was the Arabic Al-Jazeera cable news network.  Whenever information is not available through conventional news sources, we've found that Internet searches multiply, and this is what happened when the video of American prisoners of war captured in Iraq became available through the Al-Jazeera website.  For a brief period in 2003, Al-Jazeera searches were three times more popular than searches for sex. The desire to find information not given by conventional news sources also drove many of the searches in July and August that made Kobe Bryant the highest-searched male of 2003.  During these months, over half of the searches for the Kobe Bryant rape case searched not for Bryant himself but for information about the name and biography of his accuser.  These searches demonstrated a major dilemma for high-profile sexual assault cases in the Internet era. With so much information available online, and so little policing of what sites are publishing, no high-profile rape victim can count on remaining anonymous. Major news organizations kept the woman's name and picture private but independent websites and radio talk show hosts revealed this woman's name and stories about her past that may or may not be true.  The accuser actually finished the year as the sixth most-searched woman of 2003, with more searches than Anna Kournikova (#37), Christina Aguilera (#25), or Madonna, but only one of six searches asked for her by name. The end of 2003 has been dominated by celebrity scandals like the Prince Charles rumors (#156), the Michael Jackson (#73) arrest, and, most significantly, the Paris Hilton sex tape.  Interest in the debutante party girl had been growing gradually all year, and she finally appeared in the Lycos 50 for the first time in October .  But once the homemade video of her having sex with ex-boyfriend Rick Solomon was released on the Internet in November, searches for Hilton exploded.  It's just the latest example of how search activity goes sky-high whenever someone we don't expect to see naked appears naked, or is rumored to be naked, on the Internet.  During the second week of November , Paris Hilton and the sex tape generated more search activity than all of the search terms from number two through number 15 combined. On the entertainment front, the significant development of 2003 was a higher-than-usual number of stars who seemingly came out of nowhere to take prominent places in pop culture.  Actually, in the case of Clay Aiken (#24), one star literally came out of nowhere.  In January, Aiken was a 24-year-old just out of college and working with the mentally disabled in North Carolina.  By midsummer, he was one of America's biggest musical superstars thanks to American Idol (#30), and for the year he finishes as the third most-searched male on the Internet behind only Kobe Bryant and rapper 50 Cent (#18) -- another star who never received searches until late 2002. What's most astonishing about Aiken's popularity is that his fan base, perceived as consisting of teenage girls, actually consists primarily of women aged 30 to 50.  Those teenage girls instead turned their attention in 2003 to two new musical stars, Canadian rocker Avril Lavigne (#51) and sitcom-actress-turned-singer-and-movie-star Hilary Duff (#61).  Out-of-nowhere entertainment stars also included the Russian pop group t.A.T.u. (#39) and the goth-rock band Evanescence (#71). OTHER BIG BREAKOUTS OF 2003: Pop psychologist Dr. Phil , Atkins competitor The South Beach Diet , Japanese cartoon Inuyasha , maturing teen queens The Olsen Twins , wrestling babe Torrie Wilson , Jamaican dancehall rapper Sean Paul , porn star-turned-politician Mary Carey , rockers Coldplay , jazz-pop chanteuse Norah Jones , and celebrity dirt website The Smoking Gun . HOT IN 2002, NOT HOT IN 2003: all file-swapping software except KaZaA, the sex tape scandal of Asian politician Chu Mei-Feng , pop star Shakira , actor Josh Hartnett , Summer Olympics , toy and cartoon Zoids , rock bands Incubus , Blink-182 , and System of a Down , Super Bowl commercials , and searches related to the September 11 attacks on America. WHERE ARE THEY NOW: If you are looking for tattoos , the term which ranked #3 in 2002 and #4 in 2001, we made an editorial decision in June to retire the term from the Lycos 50 after 200 weeks.  The searches had become so constant that tattoos belonged on the list of generic subjects like lyrics and games that we don't include on our weekly list. ONES TO WATCH 2004: There hasn't been a movie in years as controversial as Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ , which is already getting lots of searches... Other hot 2004 films getting searches already include Brad Pitt in Troy , Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , and Catwoman , which also should make Halle Berry a summer staple of the Lycos 50... Rock band Nine Inch Nails gets plenty of searches but has never made the Lycos 50; that should change when 2004 brings their first album of new material since 1999... Chad Michael Murray looks like the next hot teen heartthrob... The latest game in the Grand Theft Auto series is scheduled for fall 2004... Since female artists usually get even bigger once they go solo (example: Beyonce ), expect big things from No Doubt's Gwen Stefani in 2004... Acouple of previously unknown athletes become huge stars during each Olympics , and two U.S. names to watch are gymnasts Chellsie Memmel and Carly Patterson ... Anti-impotence drug Cialis is hugely popular in Europe and is coming to challenge Viagra in the U.S. ONES TO WATCH 2003: Our predictions for 2003 turned out to be quite successful. Daredevil boosted Jennifer Garner to stardom, even though the movie didn't do as well as expected. The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3 both made plenty of money. LeBron James went from high school prospect to the NBA player with the most-purchased jersey.  Beyonce became a true R&Bsuperstar with her first solo album.  On the other hand, computer game Doom III was delayed and never came out, and actor Eric Bana went nowhere as star of The Hulk . KEEP WATCHING: That's not all for the Web's Most Wanted awards.

Return: Home > Popular Topics Grade Configuration in K-12 Schools Nancy McEntire 2002 (Last updated May 2005) Many educators and communities are searching for evidence on the best way to provide a high-quality education for their children and to make the best use of their education funds. One area that is of perennial interest is how to best configure the grades in local schools. Public education in the United States provides for kindergarten through grade 12 in a variety of grade arrangements, from the K-12 school to separate schools for single grades. Unfortunately, as Paglin and Fager (1997) point out: \"Research has not provided definitive answers to the myriad possible questions about grade span, but the questions have never gone away. They are questions which arise whenever school reform, increasing or declining enrollment, or financial considerations bring about a reorganization of existing schools, the building of new schools, or consolidation of districts\" (p. 2). Much of the research available has been done on rural or middle schools. The research on the \"best\" grade configuration is inconclusive. At best, it indicates factors to be considered in deciding on a school's grade span or a community's configuration of grades within its elementary and secondary school system.

The separation of students in grades \r\n              5 or 6 to 7 or 8 in middle schools is justified by some school districts \r\n              because districts believe that middle schools better meet the developmental \r\n              needs of preadolescents. As Howley (2002) points out, the developmental \r\n              needs of young adolescents differ from those of elementary school \r\n              children and older teenagers. \"Developmentally responsive middle \r\n              schools must take into account all that is known about young adolescents \r\n              and the cultural context in which they live\" (Lounsbury, 1996). \r\n              The number of middle schools increased by 35% from 1967 to 2000 \r\n              ( http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d01/dt095.asp ). In the past \r\n              decade, researchers also have demonstrated renewed interest in schools \r\n              that include grades kindergarten through 12. Astudy of rural schools \r\n              that examined the relationship between grade configuration and student \r\n              achievement in Louisiana found that students in K-12 rural schools \r\n              did as well or better on achievement tests as students in separate \r\n              elementary, middle, or high schools. Students in high poverty areas \r\n              also did better in the K-12 schools (Franklin & Glascock, 1996). \r\n              Asimilar study in Texas analyzed data from a study of 1001 Texas \r\n              high schools, including 116 K-12 schools.

Another \r\n                study found that each time students switched schools, their feelings \r\n                of anonymity increased. Researchers who found that sixth-grade \r\n                students in both elementary and combination K-12 schools outperformed \r\n                students in middle schools or junior high schools considered the \r\n                number of transitions a significant factor.

The schools were located in both urban and rural \r\n                settings in 5 northwest states. The number of grades in the schools \r\n                ranged from 1 to 11 (Paglin & Fager, 1997). Another \r\n                research study found that girls in early adolescence suffered \r\n                from a drop in self-esteem, extracurricular participation, and \r\n                leadership behaviors when they made the transition into middle \r\n                school or junior high, but not if they remained in an elementary \r\n                school setting. This study found that the effects of this transition \r\n                lingered throughout the school years. For boys, the study found \r\n                similar negative effects in extracurricular participation and \r\n                grades, but not in self-esteem, when they made the transition \r\n                into middle school or junior high. The authors concluded that \r\n                the relatively protected elementary school setting made the entry \r\n                into adolescence less stressful for both boys and girls. The students \r\n                who had not had the stress of the earlier transition seemed to \r\n                cope better with the transition into high school than did other \r\n                students (Simmons & Blyth, 1987). Franklin \r\n                and Glascock (1996) found that sixth-grade boys experienced more \r\n                suspensions in middle schools or junior high schools than in elementary \r\n                schools, possibly related to the effects of the transition, the \r\n                school organization, or school size. This study was based on information \r\n                gathered from all Louisiana public schools during the 1992-1993 \r\n                school year."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "What \r\n              factors do school districts consider when deciding on grade configuration?"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Researchers \r\n              at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory looked at eight \r\n              schools with seven different grade spans.

Language: English Document Type: Reports--Research (143) Geographic Source: U.S.; Michigan Journal Announcement: RIEAPR2004 The effect of grade span configuration (grouping of grades in schools) and school-to-school transition on student achievement was investigated. The Michigan Education Assessment Program test was used to collect data on the passing rate of students in 232 schools in a large urban inner city school district in the midwest. The results indicate that grade span configuration and school-to-school transition had significant positive and negative effects on student achievement respectively. The paper discusses implications for school districts.

Since this study was limited to a single \r\n              school district that included all four elementary school configurations \r\n              in communities that were found to be similar, variables that historically \r\n              confuse the application of results to conclusions were systematically \r\n              eliminated as causal factors.

Document Type: Reports--Research (143) Geographic Source: U.S.; Ohio Research across \r\n              seven very different states has shown that as schools get larger, \r\n              the average achievement among economically disadvantaged students \r\n              declines. Atraditionally strong argument against smaller schools, \r\n              however, is that they are too expensive. Large consolidated schools \r\n              with narrowly specialized grade spans are typically offered as necessary \r\n              to save money and to meet the needs of different age groups. This \r\n              paper examines whether the size-by-socioeconomic status interaction \r\n              effect proves robust across alternative regression model specifications, \r\n              as it did across different states. It also explores whether the \r\n              equity gains associated with smaller schools are incompatible with \r\n              the need to save money. Analysis with four different regression \r\n              model specifications consistently found that increased school size \r\n              was related to increases in achievement-test-score costs associated \r\n              with economically disadvantaged students. School size was negatively \r\n              related to expenditure per pupil, but this relationship became increasingly \r\n              tenuous as size increased, and eventually savings became negligible. \r\n              In addition, organizational factors, especially as manifest in the \r\n              distinctive components of the single-unit school, were related to \r\n              cost reduction. For those interested in balancing expenditure per \r\n              pupil with achievement-based equity, the best grade-span configuration \r\n              seems to be a small single-unit school.

Document Type: Reports--Research (143) Geographic Source: U.S.; West Virginia Research has \r\n              revealed interactive effects of school size and socioeconomic status--as \r\n              school size increases, the mean measured achievement of schools \r\n              with disadvantaged students declines. The larger the number of less \r\n              advantaged students attending a school, the greater the decline. \r\n              This study also examined the claim that large schools with a narrow \r\n              range of grades necessarily save money by achieving economies of \r\n              scale. Results indicate that school size was negatively related \r\n              to costs, but this relationship became increasingly tenuous as school \r\n              size increased, with savings eventually becoming negligible. In \r\n              addition, analysis of organizational factors distinct to the single-unit \r\n              school indicates that if schools are designed solely to minimize \r\n              expenditure per pupil, the best configuration may be a large single-unit \r\n              school. However, if expenditure per pupil is balanced with achievement-based \r\n              equity, the best configuration seems to be one small single-unit \r\n              school per district. While decreased size would increase costs, \r\n              the fact that there is only one school with 13-15 grade levels would \r\n              substantially diminish costs.

Document Type: Reports--Descriptive (141) Geographic Source: U.S.; Oregon This booklet \r\n              is the fourth in a series of \"hot topic\" reports, that \r\n              address current educational concerns. The booklet examines questions \r\n              relating to grade configurations, its purpose being to increase \r\n              awareness and understanding of the issues surrounding grade span. \r\n              It explores the ways that schools have addressed concerns associated \r\n              with particular grade spans and suggests avenues for further inquiry. \r\n              The text focuses on historical trends in grade configuration and \r\n              the various contexts of grade spans, such as whether a school is \r\n              in a rural or an urban area. Most research on grade span focuses \r\n              on the middle grades and addresses such questions as: Which grades \r\n              should be grouped together in one school? How many grades should \r\n              be in one school? and How many school transitions will students \r\n              make during the K-12 years? Some tips for starting a school with \r\n              a grade span new to a school system are offered, followed by an \r\n              overview of grade-span considerations. The bulk of the volume describes \r\n              eight schools' experiences with grade spans, discussing such issues \r\n              as how the grade span came about and how the schools were structured \r\n              to meet the needs of the particular grades it contains.

Language: English Document Type: Reports--Research (143); Speeches/meeting papers \r\n              (150) Geographic Source: U.S.; West Virginia Journal Announcement: RIEMAR1997 This report \r\n              presents selected results of a national study of school districts \r\n              operating at least one K-12 unit school. Of the 706 districts operating \r\n              unit schools, 157 districts in 27 states responded to the survey. \r\n              The majority of respondents (106) were superintendents of one-school \r\n              districts, that is, districts in which the K-12 unit school was \r\n              the only school. Of the 53 multischool districts, about half operated \r\n              just one K-12 unit school. Data reveal that K-12 unit schools were \r\n              usually located in an agricultural region where socioeconomic status \r\n              was lower than the national average; the average unit school enrollment \r\n              was 414; most unit schools in multischool districts were comparatively \r\n              remote from key resources such as hospitals, interstate highways, \r\n              and cities; superintendents of single-school districts reported \r\n              higher rates of above-average test scores, postsecondary attendance, \r\n              and high school completion than did superintendents of multischool \r\n              districts; satellite and Internet systems were the most prevalent \r\n              forms of distance learning technologies in use; community attitudes \r\n              toward single-school districts were moderately and positively related \r\n              to the sustainability of the school; single-school districts spent \r\n              almost 50 percent more per pupil than multischool districts; and \r\n              single-school districts more often than multischool districts employed \r\n              cooperative strategies for maximizing resources such as joining \r\n              regional service agencies or cooperating with other districts.

Results indicate that sixth- \r\n              and seventh-grade students performed better in elementary and K-12 \r\n              schools than in middle or secondary schools, in terms of both achievement \r\n              and persistence. Students in K-12 schools performed as well as those \r\n              in elementary schools overall and performed better in some cases \r\n              (grade 6 and high poverty). For grades 9-12, the K-12 school was \r\n              more beneficial to students than the traditional secondary school, \r\n              particularly in the area of student persistence or conduct. With \r\n              regard to academic achievement, secondary schools did not differ \r\n              significantly from K-12 schools regardless of school size or SES. \r\n              School size did appear to impact 11th- and 12th-grade student persistence \r\n              more within the secondary school environment than that of the K-12 \r\n              school.

Document Type: Information Analysis (070) Geographic Source: U.S.; Kentucky During 1968-91, \r\n              middle schools were the only school type to grow in number, increasing \r\n              by over 400 percent. Middle school advocates focus on early adolescents' \r\n              need for developmentally appropriate institutions, but show only \r\n              a weak historical understanding of the emergence and status of middle \r\n              schools. Critical factors in early support for the middle school \r\n              movement included urban interests in countering de facto school \r\n              segregation without use of busing, urban overcrowding of elementary \r\n              and high schools, and a \"bandwagon effect\"--the desire \r\n              to appear modern and reform oriented. The emergence of rural middle \r\n              schools under the cloak of psychological progress can be destructive \r\n              to both the declining sense of community in America, and to the \r\n              actual persistence of many rural communities still organized around \r\n              K-8 or K-6 public elementary schools. Examination of the National \r\n              Center for Education Statistics's Common Core of Data indicates \r\n              that the construction of rural middle schools has led to the closing \r\n              and consolidation of rural elementary schools. During the school \r\n              years 1987/88-1991/92 the proportion of schools that were middle \r\n              schools increased 20 percent in rural areas, was unchanged in suburban \r\n              areas, and decreased 6 percent in urban areas. At the same time, \r\n              the proportion of rural schools that were K-8 declined precipitously. \r\n              Emerging school reform agendas that provide alternatives to the \r\n              \"inevitability\" of consolidation include efforts to restructure \r\n              schools as caring communities (requiring active parent and community \r\n              participation), and the development of rural schools as centers \r\n              for integrated social services.

The research is intended to assist \r\n              policymakers confronted with implementation decisions regarding \r\n              middle level programs. Future research should focus on program effectiveness \r\n              relative to \"transescents'\" needs and to goals established \r\n              by the individual school.

Document Type: Reports--Descriptive (141) Geographic Source: U.S.; California The junior \r\n              high school, typically grades 7-8 or 7-9, offers a program that \r\n              is \"not- quite-yet-but-trying-to-be\" a high school. The organization \r\n              of the middle school (commonly the grades 6-8), however, is based \r\n              on a philosophy of education that was specifically designed to meet \r\n              the special needs of a preadolescent learner; middle schools incorporate \r\n              unique curricula to better effect the transition between elementary \r\n              and high school programs, rather than attempt to approximate one \r\n              or the other. Many educators, perceiving junior highs as a \"failed\" \r\n              promise, have turned to the middle school philosophy as an affirmation \r\n              of a higher level of commitment. Indeed, since 1964, the number \r\n              of new middle schools replacing traditional junior highs has progressively \r\n              increased. Areview of research on middle-level education indicates \r\n              that: (1) although primarily an administrative concern driven by \r\n              attendance boundaries, grade level organization had little impact \r\n              on middle-level students' academic achievement; and (2) the terms \r\n              \"junior high school\" and \"middle school\" do \r\n              not define a school's program. Additionally, the effective schools \r\n              research has given rise to discriminant analyses of effective middle \r\n              school variables and allowed researchers to identify those characteristics \r\n              most commonly found within \"exemplary\" middle schools. \r\n              (159 references) (KM) Descriptors: \r\n              Age Grade Placement; Classes (Groups of Students); Curriculum Enrichment; \r\n              Educational Development; Educational Environment; Grade 6; Grade \r\n              7; Grade 8; Grouping (Instructional Purposes); Instructional Program \r\n              Divisions; Junior High Schools; *Middle Schools; *Preadolescents; \r\n              *School Organization; *Transitional Programs EJ466872 EA528302 Title: When Your K-5 School Changes to 3-5.

Document Type: RESEARCH REPORT (143); BOOK (010) Geographic Source: U.S.; Virginia In its six \r\n              chapters, this report assesses the status of the sixth grade. The \r\n              shadow study technique was employed to address three specific questions: \r\n              (1) What is a sixth grader's day in school really like? (2) In what \r\n              ways do the programs provided for sixth graders differ, depending \r\n              on where the grade is located in the school system? and (3) How \r\n              does knowledge of the nature and needs of sixth graders match up \r\n              with the program actually provided? Sixth grades studied were initial, \r\n              middle, or terminal grades. Conclusions and recommendations make \r\n              up chapter 6.

Document Type: REVIEW LITERATURE (070) Geographic Source: U.S.; Texas This paper \r\n              summarizes research relevant to the Austin Independent School District's \r\n              proposal to move sixth graders from an elementary school (K-6 or \r\n              K,4-6) to a middle school (6-8) grade grouping. Asummary of the \r\n              evolution of middle-grade education is presented. Three areas affected \r\n              by grade organization are discussed: academic achievement, nonacademic \r\n              outcomes (self-concept and anxiety), and homogeneous grade groups. \r\n              The grade organization studies of various middle grade configurations \r\n              did not show any consistent effects one way or the other. References \r\n              to 36 studies are included.

Document Type: REVIEW LITERATURE (070) Geographic Source: U.S.; California In the United \r\n              States, a \"two-tiered\" school system--elementary and secondary \r\n              education--is often spoken of, yet throughout this century the trend \r\n              has been toward a \"three tiered\" system--elementary, junior \r\n              high/intermediate/middle school, and high school. This paper reviews \r\n              literature and research regarding these trends, the advantages and \r\n              disadvantages of both systems, and the effects of grade organization \r\n              patterns on students. Particular emphasis is given to the middle/junior \r\n              high school system. The paper concludes with suggestions for changing \r\n              grade organization patterns. Appendixes include references, a chart \r\n              showing secondary grade organization patterns, and an outline of \r\n              advantages and disadvantages in the systems.

Document Type: REVIEW LITERATURE (070); EVALUATIVE REPORT (142) Geographic Source: U.S.; California Target Audience: Researchers This literature \r\n              review concerns the concept of alternative grade configurations \r\n              at the elementary level, in which elementary schools are subdivided \r\n              into primary (K-2) and intermediate (3-5) units. Because of the \r\n              paucity of literature on this concept, the major part of the report \r\n              focuses on the reorganization of the elementary schools of the South \r\n              Allegheny (Pennsylvania) school district. Although the K-2, 3-5 \r\n              structure is often implemented in response to declining enrollment, \r\n              other educational benefits cited may include better concentration \r\n              on the educational and psychological needs of children in the two \r\n              age groups, though one research study showed no significant differences \r\n              in student achievement, attitude toward school, extracurricular \r\n              participation, or career aspiration. The goals of the South Allegheny \r\n              reorganization (in response to declining enrollment) were to equalize \r\n              class sizes to facilitate multilevel instruction in reading and \r\n              math, and to make better use of staff, school buildings, and instructional \r\n              resources. Each of these objectives is described in detail, along \r\n              with perceived disadvantages. An evaluative report revealed that \r\n              the new grade structure saved money and resulted in improved discipline, \r\n              student attitudes, and student interaction. Finally, literature \r\n              on the implementation process is briefly reviewed, emphasizing the \r\n              need for clear articulation between grade levels. Notes and references \r\n              are included.

The point is, Iknew the minute that Shmi talked about the circumstances of Anakin's birth that he was \"planned,\" and that meant to me that it was meant for him to eventually become Darth Vader. Imean, D'uh! SINCE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS. Ask George Lucas this: \"George, did you mean for Anakin to become Darth Vader, and that the Sith were involved in his creation? Did you intend for Palpatine, who becomes Emperor, to be the driving force (by way of what he learned from his own master) behind the creation of Anakin/Vader? Let me guess . . . the answer would be . . . \"YES.\" Okay, I've been hanging around here for a couple of months, as well as anxiously awaiting this movie to see if the series can be redeemed.  I've finally decided to break my silence and speak up and call \"bullshit\" on this. There's no \"well 'duh!\" moment, Jim.  You may have assumed that GL was going to head that way with the story, but you never knew, and neither did we.  Technically, with what we've been told in this thread about ROTS, we can still only make an assumption.  You have no call talking down to someone about a couple lines in TPM because the only thing those lines imply is immaculate conception. As far as your ask GL question, it's irrelevant to the subject.  The subject is whether or not one can infer from Episodes 1 and 2 if Anakin was definitely created via Palpatine.  And the answer is \"no.\"  One can certainly hypothesize this - hell, the morons over at TheForce.net have been arguing this possibility for years.  But even the rapid fanboy repeat viewer can't extrapolate your assumptions about the storyline from the material presented in Episodes 1 and 2.  All you can do is guess at the possibilities until the text gives you an answer. For what it's worth, Ialso appreciate this plot turn - it rings truer to the machinations of Palpatine than the will of microscopic life forms. Bailey 05-06-2005, 05:41 PM jabba there's a difference between guessing that plot revelation and it having been previously cemented in the text.   there was all kinds of speculation as to the nature of the immaculate conception, but there was nothing in episodes 1 or 2 that indicated palpatine had to be behind it.  Imean, you might as well reason since he talks so much about \"planning\" and \"forseeing\" that he was behind lando losing the falcon to han in a game of intergalactic texas hold 'em.  it was a possibility, sure, but it was left open until now. Samurai Mike 05-06-2005, 05:48 PM Ifind the idea that Palpatine is Anakins father one of the most unimaginative and mind-bogglingly unoriginal plot contrivances in movie history. Lucas came up with THAT in 20 years?! But Idigress, can anyone give me a good rating of the lightsaber duels? Is it really just a case of quantity over quality, or were you just expecting a bit too much? There are supposed to be 5 duels in this film, but they've barely warranted a mention so far. Are they really that bad?

For what it's worth, Ialso appreciate this plot turn - it rings truer to the machinations of Palpatine than the will of microscopic life forms. Yeah, call bullshit. Iam sorry, but you can't argue with reality. The REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the creation of Darth Vader. Goddammit, but it is all there on the screen. Icannot believe that Sean (Fett) and gravedigger couldn't see this coming. Ifucking saw it coming, and Ihave discussed this ad nauseum with my friends over the past several YEARS. And as for asking GL, it is NOT IRRELEVANT, since Star Wars is HIS creation. Some of us are, apparently, more intuitive than others. Ican't help it that this is so. Charlie Brigden 05-06-2005, 05:51 PM Did Palpatine name me Sean too? devincf 05-06-2005, 05:52 PM Ithink the duels are fairly lifeless most of the time, and The Duel is a major disappointment. BTW, Ithink it's interesting that people here are saying my take is negative. Iam definitely more positive than negative on the film, and my review at rottentomatoes will be fresh rated. But Episode III is a pretty mediocre movie, and it fizzles more than it sizzles - and frankly, Episode III needed to be the one to hit it out of the ballpark. As a generic action film it's OK, as the most important episode of the PT it's a bummer. gravedigger 05-06-2005, 05:57 PM Congratulations on being a good guesser, Jabba, but that doesn't mean ANYTHING in the first two prequels sets up the revelation about Palpatine being Anakin's old man. Waker 05-06-2005, 06:00 PM Ithink the duels are fairly lifeless most of the time, and The Duel is a major disappointment. BTW, Ithink it's interesting that people here are saying my take is negative. Iam definitely more positive than negative on the film Yea Idon't see where anybody'd get the impression that you hated the film, besides of course your several posts happily bashing it. And Fatboy is a douche, if only because he goes over the top about everything he ever writes about or discusses, and has no self-awareness; he's wound up leaving, dramatically, every board on the internet, and critiquing them at length on the next board he wanders to. But that doesn't necessarily invalidate his points. Samurai Mike 05-06-2005, 06:02 PM Ithink the duels are fairly lifeless most of the time, and The Duel is a major disappointment. Man that sucks, after the cool but way too short duels in AOTC. So what IS good? devincf 05-06-2005, 06:06 PM McGregor is good. The scene at the ballet, minus the whole thing about Palpy making Anakin, is good. The slaughter at the Jedi temple is good. Obi Wan leaving Anakin to die is good. The back and forth plotting between Palpatine and the Jedi Council (each is trying to use Anakin against the other) would be GREAT if it happened in more than two back to back scenes. That should have been the main plot of the movie, with Anakin increasingly  torn. cognizant 05-06-2005, 06:13 PM Noob question:  Why would Palpatine 'create' someone powerful enough to beat him?  He looked pretty comfortable using Maul, Dooku, etc, aways staying on top. devincf 05-06-2005, 06:15 PM Noob question:  Why would Palpatine 'create' someone powerful enough to beat him?  He looked pretty comfortable using Maul, Dooku, etc, aways staying on top. Ithink it's a good question. Iguess he thought he could control Vader? The other question is: how does Vader go from being the right hand man of Palpatine in III to Tarkin's bitch in IV? Russ Fischer 05-06-2005, 06:17 PM The other question is: how does Vader go from being the right hand man of Palpatine in III to Tarkin's bitch in IV? He fell in with a bad crowd....Chewbacca. cognizant 05-06-2005, 06:20 PM Ithink it's a good question. Iguess he thought he could control Vader? We could stretch it and hypothesize that Palpatine's masterplan was to create and then ensure the Skywalker line would continue and he would use each member like lapdogs for his nefarious schemes (because he's a lazy bastard or something), first Anakin, then his son Luke, and so on forever, but this plan (ludicrous as it sounds) is shot to shit from the beginning because of Anakin's duel with Obi 1 which leaves him more machine than man. Or something equally contrived. Charlie Brigden 05-06-2005, 06:21 PM Iguess Palpatine was so overconfident in his powers of control that he though no apprentice would ever try to overthrow him, even with the Sith's history. Maybe he saw himself as the ultimate Sith Lord, and after Vader decided he wouldn't need any more to do his bidding, but didn't think what had gone on in the past with Sith overthrowing Sith would ever happen to him. Ialways saw Vader as a kind of advisor. Tarkin was the main military commander, and Vader was always just there in the background to represent the Emperor. Akind of Sith Advisor Iguess. Russ Fischer 05-06-2005, 06:23 PM Noob question:  Why would Palpatine 'create' someone powerful enough to beat him?  He looked pretty comfortable using Maul, Dooku, etc, aways staying on top. That's the problem with foreseeing things. Unlike Jim, most seers can't actually see how everything is going to work out. Palpatine could control Vader easily -- that's the great thing about conditioning someone with hate and loss. Vader was supposed to kill Yoda and Kenobi. With their deaths, Padme and the kids might not have lived, or the children could have been raised as Sith. (Like Jordan, Minnesota for dark jedi.) If Vader hadn't failed to kill those two jedi, none of the OT would happen, and Palpatine and Vader would still be steering the ship. Litmus Configuration 05-06-2005, 06:23 PM Hmmm.  Iused to like Fatboy.  Now he's proven himself to be both a coward and a liar.  Ashame he went off the deep end and started fabricating all sorts of nonsense regarding people's honest opinions.  Oh well. Frankly, Ithink my opinion of EP3 has been pretty balanced, pointing out the good and the bad.  And compared to how Ifeel about EPs 1 and 2, Ifeel my overall opinions about EP3 are downright positive.  Iguess everything either has to be a \"masterpiece\" or a \"failure\" for most people these days. Darth Chocula 05-06-2005, 06:39 PM How is Jimmy Smits in this as Organa?

Iask because a lot of people (like me) liked them first up, then saw through the eye candy soon after. Iguess I'm asking you if you think you're current opinion on Ep 3 will change?

Iask because a lot of people (like me) liked them first up, then saw through the eye candy soon after. Iguess I'm asking you if you think you're current opinion on Ep 3 will change? Istrongly disliked both EPs 1 and 2 right out of the gate...but in different ways.  My hatred of EP1 was very confusing because Ihad been such a die-hard STAR WARS fan for so many years.  It took me a while to fully reconcile my disappointment.  Ihad no such hesitation with EP2. EP3 is a different animal.  The more Ithink about it, the more questions Iend up asking.  Unfortunately, I'm not finding satisfying answers.  But still, Iconsider it a significant improvement over EPs 1 and 2, and for that, Iremain somewhat grateful that at least one of the Prequels wasn't a total failure. Canned Food 05-06-2005, 08:06 PM Although Ihaven't seen the movie yet, Inoticed some of you guys were speculating on \"what ifs?,\" such as \"what if Anakin had killed Obi Wan Kenobi.\" It's interesting to see how the future shifts dramatically throughout episode III, causing people to wonder how things could have been if they had not transpired as they did in the film: Anakin and Padme were gonna retire to Naboo after their secret got out and both were expelled from their homes. Then, Anakin converted to the Sith, and things were going to be that the Jedi would be extinguished, Palpatine would be killed by Anakin/Vader, and Padme would sit as his side as the new Imperial family in the galaxy. Kinda neat to imagine how their kids would have been like had they been raised as Sith.

But... that said, who's to say that he's lying? devincf 05-06-2005, 08:26 PM Fatboy is simply full of shit on that point. On both points, probably. Has he seen the movie? Because the way that Palpatine talks about it... anyway, ANakin shows no reaction to the creating life thing. Weak seduction. devincf 05-06-2005, 08:28 PM And frankly, these films are not so subtle that he would be lying about that (after leaving the immaculate conception door open from I) without us being told. Russ Fischer 05-06-2005, 08:30 PM From my perspective, it doesn't matter. Immaculate/Jesus Anakin is terrible. Created Anakin is terrible. And what of the midichlorians? Using the Jesus example (as in the thread) they don't fit. Midichlorians weren't necessary to create Jesus. Granted, they're another very stupid idea, but an idea that doesn't fit well with the Jesus theory nonetheless. Graham 05-06-2005, 08:32 PM What did you think of Eps 1 and 2 when you first saw them?

I'll have to wait until Isee it on the 19th to be sure. But, would Lucas throw that line in there and never mention it again if it were true? Some of the arguements mad ein that thread and the one at theforce.net are valid. Such as, If Palpatine could create force sensitive children why not build an entire army of them?  The fact that anakin was worried over Padme's death would be a great reason for Palp's to lie about this power also.  On the other hand it would be a great blow to the Jedi. Imean finding out that your prophecy had been fulfilled by genetic enhancement? Makes all of their beliefs go down the tubes. Samurai Mike 05-06-2005, 08:35 PM I'm glad to hear Ewan is finally getting a chance to shine here (well Ihope so). Compared with the first two films, what would you rate Obi-wans 'kickass factor' in this one? With say TPM being  a 7 (cool Maul fight, little else), and a 3 for AOTC (generally clueless, unsatisfying fights, needs kids to help him etc.) Also, what amount of time does he have onscreen? devincf 05-06-2005, 08:40 PM could be.

He may have needed to have found the right person. Lucas never mentioning the line again is what shows that it's true. Also, how many times does Palpatine really lie to Anakin?

Granted, they're another very stupid idea, but an idea that doesn't fit well with the Jesus theory nonetheless. Actually, Ihave to agree with Fischer on this one.  While Iprefer the Palpatine-created version, having to decide between the two is like having to decide if you want a kick in the nuts or toothpicks shoved under your fingernails.  Ihappen to be a fingernail guy, because Ilike my nuts. Isaw early drafts of TPM script in which Anakin's father was a krayt dragon hunter on Tatooine.  It would have worked just fine if Anakin's father was some long-dead hero, which would satisfy both needs: Anakin having the burden of high expectations because of his lineage, and the want of a father-figure, which Obi and Palpatine jockey to replace.

Most importantly, Ihad never been near an internet messageboard in my life. Over the years Icame to see it for the soulless toy commercial it is, but for a while there I DID like it, and I'm not ashamed to admit it. AOTC Iliked the first time, got caught up in it, cheered when Yoda got his groove on. However, by the second showing Iwas over it, too many crap scenes to forgive, and it seemed the characters had regressed (Obi-wan and Padme, I'm looking at YOU). Ihaven't watched it at all since its theatrical run (except for a crappy vcd copy Iborrowed from a friend that had hilarious subtitles. \"The Jedi will be finished, fella!\":) Jim Pappas/Jabba 05-06-2005, 09:16 PM Congratulations on being a good guesser, Jabba, but that doesn't mean ANYTHING in the first two prequels sets up the revelation about Palpatine being Anakin's old man. Idon't think Iwas guessing. It was my take on things once Shmi started talking about the circumstances of Anakin's birth. Imean, it wasn't just coincidence that Qui Gon ended up on Tatooine, it wasn't just coincidence that he met Anakin there. It was part of Palpatine's plan, or that is what Ithought. That was how Itook it at the time. After all, doesn't Yoda say later to \"not underestimate the powers of the Emperor?\" Itook that line from Ep. 6 and applied that logically to what happens in the PT. Iwas wrong about one thing Iconsidered, that Qui Gon was secretly a Sith, so I'm not that good of a guesser. Jim Pappas/Jabba 05-06-2005, 09:23 PM Actually, Ihave to agree with Fischer on this one.  While Iprefer the Palpatine-created version, having to decide between the two is like having to decide if you want a kick in the nuts or toothpicks shoved under your fingernails.  Ihappen to be a fingernail guy, because Ilike my nuts. Isaw early drafts of TPM script in which Anakin's father was a krayt dragon hunter on Tatooine.  It would have worked just fine if Anakin's father was some long-dead hero, which would satisfy both needs: Anakin having the burden of high expectations because of his lineage, and the want of a father-figure, which Obi and Palpatine jockey to replace. Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it wasn't Anakin who is \"the one\" it is actually his son, Luke, who did not come from any virgin birth. It could also be considered that the midichlorians themselves defeated the emperor's plan by somehow manipulating Vader into wanting to join with his son, thus leading to the fall of the emperor. It was, after all, love that finally defeated the emperor, not the force. The love of a father for his son. Iknow I'd like to learn more about these midichlorians, and whether or not they have a form of sentience that could be communicated with on some level. Maybe Lucas will address that with the further Clone Wars cartoons, or the live action series he's planning. gl2899 05-06-2005, 09:48 PM SPOILERS This film has a higher number of laugh out loud moments than the other two. Sadly, they are all in the more intense and emotional scenes. Lucas seems to be emotionally tone deaf. The movie ended up being what Iexpected: reasonable eye candy with a groaner of a story. It's full of fairly ridiculous stuff: The Emperor is a joke (although Palpatine at the opera/ballet is great) Lucas should have stopped having old men fight Mace vs Sidious is one of the worst fight scenes ever The Duel is a huge disappointment. It's actually sort of boring and has none of the emotional heaviness of the one at the end of JEDI. The opening rescue sequence is like the Jedi Knight Follies Lucas insists on crowding his frame in every fight scene. There's no emotional component to any of this stuff. Padme's death is frankly ludicrous So is Vader as Frankenstein Vader cries. Twice. General Grievous is a villain who belongs in a spoof. At one point he wrings his hands because i guess he has no mustache to twirl There is some good stuff: McGregor, once the movie picks up steam There are a couple of choice shots, including SPOILER the one where Vader goes to kill the younglings END SPOILER Either the effects shots are much better this time than AOTC or I'm just really used to digital stunt men. Well, sounds like they stuck to the [bleep]ing script. Padme dies of a [bleep]ing broken heart? Anakin is more whiny psycho than galactic badass? General Grievous is Snidely Whiplash in a tin suit? Yeah, the people that said that the leaked script wasn't indicative of what was to come were wrong. Thats as believable as Anakin as Christ. Shouldn't have bought into the hype. Shame on my thrice. Ihope some people can enjoy it though. My nephew is going to love it. Seeing him enjoy this movie will be worth it to me. But Iam just not the target audience for Star Wars anymore. *edited because Iswear too much* Bailey 05-06-2005, 09:56 PM Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it wasn't Anakin who is \"the one\" it is actually his son, Luke, who did not come from any virgin birth.

Maybe Lucas will address that with the further Clone Wars cartoons, or the live action series he's planning. or maybe lucas just didn't know exactly how it was going to play out either-- and during the course of writing it he painted himself into some corners that were resolved less than satisfactorily.  it happens in single screenplays all the time, let alone a story that takes place over six.  that wouldn't be the worst of the PT's faults.   whether palpatine helped to conceive anakin or not, it's still contrived.  Idon't see why palpatine helping would make it less so, as it just adds another level to it (and takes more of the human element out of anakin's failure not to mention further complicates the \"prophecy\".)   Ithink if it's only a single line in the movie then fatboy's interpretation is still a possibility, at least for those of us who may want to willfully ignore the added twist.  Idon't mind ambiguity- but to detail the whole midichlorian\\immaculate conception\\prophecy thing and still leave it ambiguous seems really dumb. Jim Pappas/Jabba 05-07-2005, 12:02 AM GL knew exactly how it was going to play out. He's had this whole vision in his head for many years. Also, Ithink maybe many of us are taking all of this way too seriously. Star Wars is a movie series, that is all that it is. It is popular entertainment, not something that is going to get food into the bellies of the poor and starving on this planet. We need to maintain perspective here. Timmay 05-07-2005, 12:49 AM \"Maybe we need to think that Qui Gon was actually wrong, that it wasn't Anakin who is \"the one\" it is actually his son, Luke, who did not come from any virgin birth.\" But it wasn't Luke that killed the emperor, it was Anakin, hence destoying the Dark Side and such. Ijust had to chime in at least once on this.  Personally, Itried to not get too excited about this last episode, but as a 27 year old with older brothers who grew up with Star Wars toys all around me and having Return of the Jedi as my seminal movie event of my childhood it's impossible.  We're supposed to see Anakin turn into Darth freaking Vader here!  You can't blow that, you can't.....you can't..... But Idigress, back to the discussion...... Russ Fischer 05-07-2005, 01:12 AM We're supposed to see Anakin turn into Darth freaking Vader here!  You can't blow that, you can't.....you can't..... Ithink the last thing Isay on this entire topic has to be: \"Noooooooooooooooooo!\" The Sphinx 05-07-2005, 01:44 AM So, does Palpatine or Dooku (or anybody else for that matter) take responsibility for the death of Shmi? Barry Woodward 05-07-2005, 01:48 AM It is popular entertainment, not something that is going to get food into the bellies of the poor and starving on this planet.Actually, from a certain point of view, it does. Lucas has held special screenings for each of the prequels and donates all the proceeds to various charities. theslik1 05-07-2005, 03:56 AM The thing that's most surprising to me is that no one is really spending much time talking about The Duel. THIS is the moment we've been waiting for since the end of the second act of SW:ANH. We meet again, at last. The circle is now complete; when Ileft you, Iwas but the learner, now Iam the master. And now the people who've watched The Duel aren't even mentioning it as one of the high points of the film, as particularly emotional or even memorable. That's a horrible sign. The first horrible sign, of course, was the opening crawl for TPM. In retrospect, that told us everything we needed to know about the cynical, self-indulgent pointlessness of the entire PT. ROTS is simply the natural culmination of a collosal waste of film-making resources and the ultimate \"fuck you\" from Lucas, who seemed determined from the start to force feed his extremely beige vision of Star Wars to the masses. It's really pretty simple...Lucas had the pick of many excellent story ideas and every conceivable technical resource at his disposal to ensure thoughtful, well crafted movies. Those factors alone make the final product inexcusable...beautiful high-tech bilgewater, deliberately and defiantly thrust in our faces by a man who was sure we'd pay for it no matter what. He was right, twice. And he'll be right again this time. It would be interesting to see how this would've all played out if ROTS actually were a first rate film. The disconnect between it and the first two prequels would be too jarring Ithink, and that would've definitively cast the Prequel Trilogy as a failure (regardless of the box office). It makes you wonder if George had to \"Lucasize\" parts of the movie...including The Duel...to ensure that the tone of mediocrity remained at least somewhat uniform from film to film. But enough of my paranoia... My rant isn't a slam at the fans. Iknow what it's like to be a fan, and as a fan it's very disappointing to think of what could have been with the right story and the right director. mastronikolas 05-07-2005, 07:00 AM How long till the extremely vocal bashers manage to convince people that it's even worse than Menace and Clones and that everybody initially liked it because they got caught up in the hype? Ihave my answer: 72 posts. That's how long. The Dark Shape 05-07-2005, 07:26 AM The first horrible sign, of course, was the opening crawl for TPM.

You know, I'd insert an attempted, witty \"So you've seen the film?\" comment here, but it works so many times both ways I'm tired of hearing it. Jim Pappas/Jabba 05-07-2005, 09:01 AM Actually, from a certain point of view, it does. Lucas has held special screenings for each of the prequels and donates all the proceeds to various charities. \"from a certain point of view\" . . . Ilove it. :) Dan Whitehead 05-07-2005, 09:19 AM GL knew exactly how it was going to play out. He's had this whole vision in his head for many years. Actually, the story of Star Wars has changed constantly since 1977. The prequels are full of things that were made up as they went along. He may have had the vaguest outline in mind, but the \"whole thing\" has not been in his head for years at all. Also, Ithink maybe many of us are taking all of this way too seriously. Star Wars is a movie series, that is all that it is. It is popular entertainment, not something that is going to get food into the bellies of the poor and starving on this planet. We need to maintain perspective here. So why do you write about movies and not the poor and starving of this planet? Hewlett 05-07-2005, 09:27 AM I'm surprised that no one has mentioned yet that an earliy draft of ROTS had Palpatine telling Anakin flat out that he created him himself. Now does the fact that Lucas took it out mean he threw out the idea completely to go with the immaculate conception/Chosen One idea, or did he just not want to spell out Palpatine's hand in Anakin's creation and leave it up to the audience to make the connection? //shrugs Jim Pappas/Jabba 05-07-2005, 10:04 AM Actually, the story of Star Wars has changed constantly since 1977. The prequels are full of things that were made up as they went along. He may have had the vaguest outline in mind, but the \"whole thing\" has not been in his head for years at all. So why do you write about movies and not the poor and starving of this planet? And upon what are you basing your belief that the prequels are full of things that were made up as they went along? That is just so wrong. GL has had the entire story as an idea in his mind, since day one. He has said this himself many times, and he is meticulous and does nothing without much planning and foresight. Isuggest you do a little research. As for the remark about my writing about the poor and starving? Ok, here we go: Hey! Poor! Stop being poor, fools! Hey! Staving! Go eat something! There, Ijust wrote about them. . . .:) Orin_Quon 05-07-2005, 10:07 AM That was such an odd thing to say. How does that imply stupidity? Because it was written by Devin. Perhaps the stupidity bit was your take when reading it from Devin's post You dont even have to read it. You should just know. Yeah, call bullshit. Iam sorry, but you can't argue with reality. The REALITY is that Palpatine DID IN FACT have something to do with the birth of Anakin, and that it was his machinations that led to the creation of Darth Vader. Goddammit, but it is all there on the screen. Icannot believe that Sean (Fett) and gravedigger couldn't see this coming. Ifucking saw it coming, and Ihave discussed this ad nauseum with my friends over the past several YEARS. And as for asking GL, it is NOT IRRELEVANT, since Star Wars is HIS creation. Some of us are, apparently, more intuitive than others. Ican't help it that this is so. Dude, shut up. Go to TheForce.net or something. GL knew exactly how it was going to play out. He's had this whole vision in his head for many years. Then... Also, Ithink maybe many of us are taking all of this way too seriously. Hilarious. Jim, Waker, join Barry Woodward in the Ignore List.

Isuggest you do a little research. The fact that Iwrote an adaptation of Attack of the Clones, and saw the constant revisions to the script as entire scenes and concepts were dropped, altered and changed during production. Check out the very first seeds of Star Wars. Anakin Starkiller and the Book of Whills. The story has evolved and changed, with Lucas picking and dumping ideas along the way, from day one. And since Luke only got a sister when Carrie Fisher wanted her character to be more important in Return of the Jedi, Ithink it's pretty obvious that this isn't some \"carved in stone\" saga that Lucas is dutifully telling.

Waker 05-07-2005, 11:21 AM Yes but that's bullshit. As someone said earlier in this thread, Lucas originally wrote that Anakin's father was a Krayt Dragon hunter or something. gl2899 05-07-2005, 11:59 AM Please Jim Pappas/Jabba, you seem like a smart guy, you have to know that as poorly as the films fit together that Lucas (although he had a rough outline in his head) has done this by the seat of his pants. You have to give props to Lucas, he is the greatest spin doctor and marketing genius of all time. Jim Pappas/Jabba 05-07-2005, 12:24 PM You don't a thing abouut George Lucas if you think the PT was \"by the seat of his pants.\" Jesus, just read some of the interviews he's given over the years where he discusses the PT. Sure, certain details had to be, by necessity, \"on the fly,\" but the overall story line has been in his head for many years. LightningLouie 05-07-2005, 01:04 PM You don't a thing abouut George Lucas if you think the PT was \"by the seat of his pants.\" Jesus, just read some of the interviews he's given over the years where he discusses the PT. Sure, certain details had to be, by necessity, \"on the fly,\" but the overall story line has been in his head for many years. From what I've seen from both fansites and official materials, like Bouzereau's Annotated Screenplays, the  \"overall storyline\" has changed so much over the years that the final version is virtually unrecognizable from the original conception. Answer me this: Why is it essential for fans to maintain the myth that Lucas planned everything out in advance  back in 1974?  Film, unlike books, is a medium based on contingency.  Stuff is always going to be going  in and  out of a movie based on the availability of performers, the amount of money involved, and totally random events.  On top of that, some ideas just become unworkable or silly or just plain bad over time.  I'm sure that Lucas had a much bigger role planned for Jar Jar over the course of  the prequels, but minimized his presence when it became apparent that everyone --EVERYONE!-- hated the shit out  of the character, and not just rabid fanboys and movie critics. There's no shame in enjoying an epic saga, even if the author was just making it up as he or she went along.  What matters is that the author maintains a certain level of quality and consistency over the course of the story-- i.e., \"as long as it's good.\"  Insisting on a single unifying vision, especially as it pertains to characters like Boba Fett, Maul, and Grevious --all more the products of toy licensing conferences than some grand Joseph Campbell mythopoeic crap-- suggests an inability to enjoy the movies for what they are.  Or maybe you aren't enjoying them all that much to begin with?  Search your feelings, you know this to be true... Besides, as everyone knows by now, Lucas swiped the plot and characters from Jack Kirby's New Gods comics and the Kinks' Part 1 Lola Versus Powerman and the Money-Go-Round. Litmus Configuration 05-07-2005, 01:05 PM You have to give props to Lucas, he is the greatest spin doctor and marketing genius of all time. Absolutely 100% correct.  (Well, aside from certain dictators throughout history.) Iguess if Lucas really had the whole story figured out 30 years ago, he would never have even publicly discussed 9 films, then 12 films, then 9 films again, then 6 films.  And yet he did.  He said in interviews that EPs 7, 8 and 9 would be about a character who survives JEDI.  So much for that story.  It wasn't until 1996 that Lucas first publicly stated that the whole Saga would be comprised of only six films, nearly 20 years after the first film hit screens and became a global pop culture phenomenon (contrary to apologists trying to downplay the impact of STAR WARS in order to make the lackluster Prequels look better in comparison.) Idon't believe a damn thing Lucas or his cronies say anymore.  Ican only look at his work and judge it on its own merits. Litmus Configuration 05-07-2005, 01:07 PM Great post, Louie! Jim Pappas/Jabba 05-07-2005, 01:16 PM Ican't understand how any of you believe that George Lucas \"made up\" the plots of the PT as he went along. Jeesh. I'm not arguing about this anymore. Iknow what the truth is, and I'm happy with my understanding of reality. If some of you want to think what it is you think, don't let me try and convince you otherwise. gl2899 05-07-2005, 01:30 PM Same here, Jim. Let's just agree to disagree. Even though 30 years of interviews with Lucas, documentaries and early scripts back up my theory ;). *edit to note: It bugs me that Lucas recently said that eps 7-9 were fabricated by fanboys and the press. Even though his comments on the three trilogies are well doucmented. Maybe he is starting to believe in the Jedi mind trick. LUCAS: Inever said Ihad plans for episodes VII through VIII FANBOYS: You never said you had plans for episodes VII through VIII Litmus Configuration 05-07-2005, 01:48 PM I'm not arguing about this anymore. Good.  Because you've obviously closed your mind to any other viewpoint but your own. LightningLouie 05-07-2005, 01:48 PM Iguess if Lucas really had the whole story figured out 30 years ago, he would never have even publicly discussed 9 films, then 12 films, then 9 films again, then 6 films.  And yet he did.  He said in interviews that EPs 7, 8 and 9 would be about a character who survives JEDI.  So much for that story. Ioften wonder how much of that was Lucas and how much of it was Gary Kurtz.  I'm not sure to what extent Kurtz was involved creatively (though his absence is felt in ROTJ), but Ialways got the feeling that he saw the SW saga as more of a grand tragic epic with a decades-long story arc than Lucas' fairy tale in space conception.  In one interview, Irecall Kurtz saying that only Leia would survive and she would end up in Episode XII as the \"People's Quen\" after the Emperor had been deposed.  Darth Vader was always going to die in Episode VI (and possibly Luke with him), but the Empire would exist for some time after, albeit in a reduced form.  The prequel trilogy would be largely disconnected from the other movies, with the first film set generations before the rest of the story, dealing with the foundation of the Jedi Order.   But there's no real evidence to substantiate any of these claims, and Kurtz was probably just drawing on conversations he'd had with Lucas back in the '70s. LightningLouie 05-07-2005, 01:51 PM Great post, Louie! Thanks.  I've been here for a while, just trying to get my bearings straight.  (Also, I've rediscovered that either I'm a terrible typist or my keyboard is a POS.) LightningLouie 05-07-2005, 02:10 PM Ican't understand how any of you believe that George Lucas \"made up\" the plots of the PT as he went along. Jeesh. I'm not arguing about this anymore. Iknow what the truth is, and I'm happy with my understanding of reality. If some of you want to think what it is you think, don't let me try and convince you otherwise. Actually, Icould swear that Ijust read an interview in which Lucas said that most of the prequel trilogy was \"filler,\" and that Ep. III was the real \"meat\" of the PT.  In other words, most of the events in Eps. Iand II were just a means of killing time before Anakin's fateful lava slalom. Believe what you want.  Ithink Lucas had the idea of doing a big outer space adventure in his head  back  in the  '70s, but that was about as specific as it got.  He narrowed down his focus by reading SF novels and Marvel Comics, and possibly Joseph Campbell as well, but probably more Castaneda.  Isuspect the theme of kids redeeming the  father probably didn't  occur to him until well  in the  pre-production of Empire, and Iseriously doubt  Leia was even going  to be a blood relation until sometime between Empire and Jedi, regardless of  the rumors about Fisher wanting a bigger role.  In short, most of the transcendent themes were things  Lucas came up with after 1977 and applied retroactively to  the saga through the magic of filmmaking and the gullibility of fans who couldn't accept that he'd improvised most of the storyline. Look, just consider this: In the first draft of Star Wars, Darth Vader, the principal villain of the OT, the central  character of the entire saga, is a minor Imperial functionary who speaks two lines and is never seen or mentioned again. Miasta 05-07-2005, 02:42 PM Look, just consider this: In the first draft of Star Wars, Darth Vader, the principal villain of the OT, the central  character of the entire saga, is a minor Imperial functionary who speaks two lines and is never seen or mentioned again. Wouldn't it be cool if Lucas let some ILM underlings or intern types at Lucas film, who have been waiting in the wings, getting coffee and stuff for the senior artist for years, have a go at doing an animated version of the first draft of Star Wars just for a goof?  Well, woudn't it?  No?  Fine!  I'd buy it, or watch it on The Cartoon Network!  Cary on... Leto II 05-07-2005, 03:07 PM Ioften wonder how much of that was Lucas and how much of it was Gary Kurtz.  I'm not sure to what extent Kurtz was involved creatively (though his absence is felt in ROTJ), but Ialways got the feeling that he saw the SW saga as more of a grand tragic epic with a decades-long story arc than Lucas' fairy tale in space conception.

But there's no real evidence to substantiate any of these claims, and Kurtz was probably just drawing on conversations he'd had with Lucas back in the '70s. To wit, from Cinescape Online, circa the summer of 1999: Kurtz Reveals 'SW 1-9' Plot Gary Kurtz, the producer of the original versions of Star Wars: A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back, spoke at a Sci-Fi Expo convention audience in Plano, Texas yesterday. After reportedly offering up a mixed review of The Phantom Menace, Kurtz shared the original plans for all nine episodes of the Star Wars saga circa 1980, according to TheForce.net. When Lucas changed course with Return of the Jedi, Kurtz opted to leave the Star Wars saga and produce The Dark Crystal with Jim Henson. What follows is the fan site's description of what Kurtz allegedly relayed (no doubt to a room full of stunned Star Wars fans), and a very cool glimpse into what might have been: EPISODE 1: Was to focus on the origins of the Jedi Knights and how they are initiated and trained. EPISODE 2: Introduction and development of Obi-Wan Kenobi. EPISODE 3: Introduction and life of Vader. EPISODE 4: There were seven different drafts of the film. At one point, they pursued buying the rights to Hidden Fortress because of the strong similarities. At one point, Luke was a female, Han was Luke's brother, Luke's father was the one in prison (interesting point for some debates) and the film featured 40 wookies. EPISODE 5: Once written, the screenplay of Empire is almost exactly what is seen on screen. The only cut scenes were those involving wampas in the rebel base (cut because of time and unsolved technical glitches) and about two minutes of Luke/Yoda Jedi training with no real dialog. EPISODE 6: Leia was to be elected \"Queen of her people\" leaving her isolated. Han was to die. Luke confronted Vader and went on with his life alone. Leia was not to be Luke's sister. EPISODE 7: Third trilogy was to focus on Luke's life as a Jedi, with very few details planned out. EPISODE 8: Luke's sister (not Leia) appears from another part of the galaxy. EPISODE 9: First appearance of the Emperor. And then there's this passage in the 1980 work Once Upon A Galaxy: A Journal of The Making of Empire Strikes Back, by Alan Arnold (pp. 247-48): Alan Arnold: Tell me more about the overall concept of the Star Wars saga. George Lucas: There are essentially nine films in a series of three trilogies.The first trilogy is about the young Ben Kenobi and the early life of Luke's father when Luke was a little boy. This trilogy takes place some twenty years before the second trilogy, which includes Star Wars and Empire. About a year or two passes between each story of the trilogy and about twenty years pass between the trilogies. The entire saga spans about fifty-five years. AA: How much is written? GL: Ihave story treatments on all nine. Ialso have voluminous notes, histories, and other material I've developed for various purposes. Some of it will be used, some not. Originally, when Iwrote Star Wars, it developed into an epic on the scale of War and Peace, so big Icouldn't possibly make it into a movie. So Icut it in half, but it was still too big, so Icut each half into three parts. Ithen had material for six movies. After the success of Star Wars Iadded another trilogy, but stopped there, primarily because reality took over. After all, it takes three years to prepare and make a Star Wars picture. How many years are left? So I'm still left with three trilogies of nine films. At two hours each, that's about eighteen hours of film! Straight from the equine's embouchement. Plus there're other Nine-Film LucasQuotes in other sources, like his Splinter of the Mind's Eye foreword. Ahoatam 05-07-2005, 04:20 PM From Time.com, Saturday, Apr. 20, 2002: http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,232440,00.html For all his film interestsnot just the companies but the extension of Raiders' Indiana Jones character into two more features and a TV serieshe was, and remains, a doting, full-time dad. But he had a neglected child, the Star Wars saga, that needed his help in growing up. Lucas began writing the new trilogy, starting with Phantom Menace, in 1994. Furthermore, Lucas says in the commentary of ANH DVD that he wrote a backstory for each character, and that fed into what eventually made the prequel story.  He didn't have 6 or 9 ready-to-go screenplays, as is the popular belief. I, too, subscribe to the paint-himself-in-corner viewpoint. Amphibatron 05-07-2005, 04:31 PM And upon what are you basing your belief that the prequels are full of things that were made up as they went along? That is just so wrong. GL has had the entire story as an idea in his mind, since day one. He has said this himself many times, and he is meticulous and does nothing without much planning and foresight. Isuggest you do a little research. If you look at early pre-production artwork of episode 1 you will see that Qui-Gon is nowhere to be seen. Obi-Wan had Qui-Gon's role all to himself.  Before Episode II Lucas had no idea what a Dooku was. Why else did he have his design team coming up with different sorts of Sith apprentices for episode II before he came up with Dooku? Grievous? Nope, no idea of Grievous until he told his art department to design a droid general.  Look at the make-up job on Palpatine in episode II and notice the differences in his appearance in Episode III. The reason for the change is because Lucas at first was flirting with the idea that Sidious would wind up looking like the Emperor of ROTJ because the darkside  had slowly degraded his appearance. He obviously changed his mind on that and now Mace is responsible. If you look at all of these major storypoints of the prequels: Qui-Gon, Dooku, Sidious' appearance and hell, just read a making of book you'll realise that Lucas had the vaguest outline and the rest has been made up as he went along. Imean he said himself in a recent interview that Episode 1 had about 20 % of whatever basic storypoints he worked out years ago. That leaves 80% made up on the fly. The same percerntage for Epiosde II. Only Sith seems to encompass the majority of the back story Lucas originally planned out.

It's not as clear-cut as, say, Sam Rockwell aping Dubya as Zaphod \"Un-dumb\" Beeblebrox in THE HITCHHIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY. There was another strange bit of modern wording in EP3 though (on par with \"The Old Folks Home\" in EP2) and Ican't quite remember the line.  It's something Obi-Wan says just before he leaves Anakin at the shipyards on Coruscant.  Ican't seem to find it in my copy of the script.  Anyone?

LightningLouie 05-07-2005, 07:51 PM Wouldn't it be cool if Lucas let some ILM underlings or intern types at Lucas film, who have been waiting in the wings, getting coffee and stuff for the senior artist for years, have a go at doing an animated version of the first draft of Star Wars just for a goof?  Well, woudn't it?  No?  Fine!  I'd buy it, or watch it on The Cartoon Network!  Cary on... Hell no, I'd pay to see that. Someone actually wrote a fan script of A Princess of Ondos, the proposed second installment of The Adventures of The Starkiller, mentioned in passing at the end of Lucas' first draft of Star Wars: http://www.starwarz.com/starkiller/fan/princess_of_ondos.htm Eschatos 05-07-2005, 11:38 PM Ithink you're saying that Kenobi should have been the central character of the PT. Icouldn't agree more. That's exactly what Iwas saying. (Iwas more focused on why Anakin/Vader should have been a supporting character in that post, so Iunderstand the cautiousness of your post.) If you think about it, actually, the films could be much more solid as they if they were edited to focus more on Kenobi and less on Skywalker. The whole problem with the PT is that Lucas, even during Ep. I, was too concerned with giving Anakin significant screen coverage. Most of Anakin's involvment in Iand II are just subplots on steroids anyway ... Also, if they had gone that route, it would have made for a stronger saga. The PT could have been the story of the benevolent father failing to deliver his son from a path of evil and the OT would have been the negative of that: the benevolent son delivers the father from that path.  The ramifications just cascade from there ... especially when you consider the tension it would have given the Yoda and Sidious relationship by making them the mentors of the central figures in the story: the patriarchs.

Until now, Star Wars has really been a reflection on past political/military conflicts (like the Third Reich) and this marks a noticable turn towards current events. Technically, the Empire was pretty topical for the Cold War period. Also, considering the sequels were released in the post-Vietnam era, the Emperor has always been topical (Lucas has stated many times that Sidious is a fictional version of Nixon).

In the somewhat divided political state the US is in now, does Lucas risk alienating a portion of his fan base by comparing the President to the Emporer?  Comments from those who have seen the film, please. It's nothing new from Lucas; the political subtext was there from the beginning, though it got submerged as the movies went on.  The Emperor was conceived of as a Nixon figure, a crafty politico turned paranoid and inaccessible, and there was always the idea of a technologically superior military force  being thwarted by primitive indigenous guerillas, like the U.S. armed forces in Vietnam.  (Remember, Lucas was originally going to  follow up American Graffiti with Apocalypse Now, so the Ewoks were probably his way of exploring that theme after  losing control of the project to Coppola.) In one  of  the deleted scenes  of Luke  and Biggs  on Tatooine, Biggs expresses concern that the Empire will draft Luke into service.  Star Wars is definitely a product  of the Watergate era, but  it came out during the Carter administration, so everybody associates it with the goofy, hedonistic late '70s.  By the '80s, Reagan and his speechwriters were using Lucas' imagery as a metaphor for the Cold  War, something he probably never anticipated or desired.  He never got over the use of \"Star Wars\" as a collective term for orbital missile defense.  In Ep. I, Lucas repays Reagan in kind by naming  the perennially befuddled and dim-witted Trade Federation leader Nute Gunray; the \"Nute\" comes from Knute Rockne All American, one of Reagan's best-known films, and as for \"Gunray,\"  just transpose  the  syllables.  For a guy who celebrates forgiveness and reconciliation, Lucas can sure  hold a grudge; after all, he named the second banana bad guy in Willow after Pauline Kael, who bashed Star Wars back in 1977, eleven years earlier. Iwould be genuinely surprised if most viewers made any sort of connections between the storyline in Ep. III and current events, mainly because it sounds as though the political aspects of Palpatine's rise to power are dowplayed  in favor of balls-to-the-wall action.  (Besides, as we all know, Lucas had it planned out in advance all along, so any parallels are purely coincidental.)  In all likelihood, there will be one or two batshit  crazy right-wing  Medved types who label Lucas a traitor after making all those good movies about upholding conservative  values, but most people won't care or notice.  And they'd be wrong about Lucas' politics, too; despite being insanely wealthy, he  still seems to regard himself as a radical experimental filmmaker and unreconstructed liberal who  managed to beat the Man at his own game, acquiring his independence one marketing license at a time.  (Insert sarcastic comment about billionaire entertainer lecturing about the dangers of attachment and materialism here.)  But even if he wanted to make Ep. III overtly political, Idoubt he'd be canny or subtle enough to pull it off, even in a dorky Star Trek kinda way. Ahoatam 05-08-2005, 12:35 AM Well put, Louie, thanks.  That seems to be a perfectly reasonable explanation and by no means a stretch.  It's a subtext that fits perfectly.

Which is the exact quote Ioriginally replied to and which is saying something completely different than what you are saying now. You asked why people believe the prequels are full of things made up as he went along and Igave you numerous examples. mastronikolas 05-09-2005, 09:49 AM Ifinally saw it. It's a very powerful piece of film-making and the first time we get real characters and real emotion in the prequel trilogy. The ending is near-perfect. Vader being entombed in the suit, Yoda's humility after failing the Jedi and the Republic, the delivery of the twins. Amazing stuff. It's perfectly obvious that the Jedi were responsible for their own fall, paying the price for being blinded , dogmatic and overconfident. And Lucas doesn't shy away from the fact that his movie is about brother turning against brother. The characters face horrible dilemmas and no one walks away unscathed. The opening battle is awe-inspiring. Words can do it no justice. The only thing Ican say is that the reveal of the hundreds of capital ships fighting far surpasses the reveal of the Star Destroyer in Episode IV. Grievous is a total red herring and a wild goose chase for Obi-Wan. If you expect that, you'll like his part (which is a very minor one). If you expect the death machine from the cartoons, you'll be disappointed. And there's a wickedly irreverent homage to E.T. Finally, Ipredict that there will be a lot of wee ones crying their little hearts out when Anakin starts burning alive. It's very graphic and heart-wrenching. This is definitely not a movie for small children. Alan \"Nordling\" Cerny 05-09-2005, 09:58 AM Oddly enough, mastronikolas, of all the CHUD posters yours was the one Iwas waiting for.  Thanks for that.   Can't wait... Litmus Configuration 05-09-2005, 10:56 AM And there's a wickedly irreverent homage to E.T. Imissed that.

Unless it means that he was faking his speech impediment all the time! cognizant 05-09-2005, 11:16 AM Well, as a 'thank you', its acceptable, but Ithought he was beyond this material world and 'missing' people, and all that stuff.  But then again, Iguess he doesnt fully come to grips with the SW Buddhist-lite notion of reality until episode 5. Litmus Configuration 05-09-2005, 11:40 AM Yoda's departure from Kashyyk: \"I'll miss you Tarful. I'll miss you Chewbacca\". And then he blasts off in his little rocket ship! Iguess the close-up on Yoda's face as the hatch shuts closed is what really makes it an homage to E.T., if that's what it really is.  The good-byes and ship take-off also work as homage but are also necessary to getting Yoda off Kashyyk. By the way, Isaw the film version and there was no scene depicting Wat Tambor's epic fight against anakin. Was that scene in the DLP version? Wat Tambor was barely in the DLP version.  Just enough for the Cult of Wat to jizz their slacks and for the rest of us to roll our eyes. To be fair, Iwas actually hoping to see more of Wat before he got diced.  Iwas hoping to have a quick reminder of why Ihate this ill-conceived character before he is then thankfully murdered.  No such luck.  Wat is merely a blur in his demise. Estel 05-09-2005, 11:56 AM My take, copied and pasted from a message Iwrote someone on the night Isaw it.  Ireserve the right to modify this kneejerk opinion when Isee it again with a normal audience on release. Yeah, it's not so good, but it's not a disaster. This one is particularly frustrating for me, though, because it has entire moments and scenes that DO play, that work emotionally, thematically, or whatever, but are constantly being undermined by glaring problems: poorly written/delivered lines, moments of weird, choppy, meaningless editing (Ben Burtt fucks this movie backasswards just like Clones), small scenelets that are over before they start (the 2nd act is plagued by this), and just mismanaged stuff that could have been great, or at least passable. It's just so painfully obvious that Lucas' reach exceeds his grasp. There's some great non-verbal bits set to music: Iloved the clones turning on the jedi across the galaxy, beautiful score, and a real sense of loss, but it's pretty contextless. Similarly, he goes for this Coppola-esque Birth of the Twins/Birth of Vader intercutting that's really magnificent all by itself (Padme's screams during labor cutting to the absolutely wrecked Anakin screaming as his limbs are re-attached) but it belongs in a different, better movie. He breaks his own SW rules all over the place in this scene (there's actually a POV shot from INSIDE the helmet, we see what a frightening isolation chamber being in the suit is). McDiarmid is nasty, campy fun, just as he was in ROTJ, and everyone else pretty much acquits themselves admirably. McGregor has fantastic moments, but also many, many others, where he clearly just can't take this bullshit seriously anymore (see his lines to Dooku before they fight). Portman and Christensen are much improved, especially Christensen, who Ithink does an admirable job with an almost unplayabe character. Who knows why anyone in this movie does anything, other than puppetmaster Lucas. Ithought that much of the duel was really good, actually, contrary to the Chud crew consensus. Iactually thought that bar a few lines, the last fourth of the film was a hint of the A-game that Lucas could have brought to the whole deal, back in the day, had he cared to. He clearly took his time with certain sequences (the purge/assault on the temple, the massacre/baptism, oops Imean \"Birthing\" sequence), and he pretty much went ahead and neglected the connective tissue that makes such sequences make sense, just like in the last film. Again, before I'm torn to shreds, this is just quick thoughts jotted down after seeing it last week.  Iactually feel a little nicer to it in the light of day.  I'll make up my mind on the 19th. Amphibatron 05-09-2005, 12:44 PM Wait, can someone confirm that the Wookiees give Tarzan yells like Chewbacca in Jedi? Please tell me this doesn't actually happen. Russ Fischer 05-09-2005, 12:46 PM Wait, can someone confirm that the Wookiees give Tarzan yells like Chewbacca in Jedi? Please tell me this doesn't actually happen.

At least not in the foreground. mastronikolas 05-09-2005, 12:55 PM ...there's actually a POV shot from INSIDE the helmet, we see what a frightening isolation chamber being in the suit is My favourite shot in the whole film. It really ads depth to Vader asking Luke to remove his helmet, so that he can see him with his own eyes. My favourite sequences (apart from the amazing opening) were centered on Obi-Wan. His realisation of what he must do, his confrontation of Padme and his final words with Anakin are really strong. Terrific acting by Ewan. Amphibatron 05-09-2005, 01:08 PM It does. Mother of fuck. Eli Ca$h 05-09-2005, 01:10 PM Idon't think Ihave much to say about the film that hasn't already been said in this thread.  My take is pretty much right in the middle of everything mentioned here.  Ididn't love it like Iwanted to, but Idid enjoy it overall. The sad thing is, Ithink if Anakin's turn to the dark side had worked, everything else would be forgivable. My biggest regret about these films will always be that he directed them all himself.  He could have stepped aside after TPM and let someone else handle AOTC and ROTS.  Considering some of the names that were said to be interested, Idon't think we would have seen most of the things that bugged me in those films. Ican't imagine Spielberg doing that crappy space diner scene or the floating fruit scene.  Ithink He would have found some way to make the Anakin-Padme dialogue work.  Ican't imagine David Fincher having so much droid comedy in ROTS, nor the terrible Windu death/Anakin turns scene.  Ialso can't imagine him having Anakin hop on a droid's head and ride over to continue the duel with Obi-Wan. Amphibatron 05-09-2005, 01:16 PM Not in my print. At least not in the foreground. Does this mean Ihave to call the theatre and ask them if they are showing the print with the retarded tarzan yell or without it? Seriously, the only theatre getting my money is the one without. I'll be damned if I'll relive the lowest point in the OT come may 19th. Alan \"Nordling\" Cerny 05-09-2005, 01:22 PM Oh c'mon.  If you can stomach it on ROTJ, you can stomach it here.  It's as if people must have their SW totally humorless.  So Lucas can't tell a joke to save his ass, get over it. Amphibatron 05-09-2005, 01:28 PM Oh c'mon.  If you can stomach it on ROTJ, you can stomach it here.  It's as if people must have their SW totally humorless.  So Lucas can't tell a joke to save his ass, get over it. Why should Ihave to stomach it to begin with? Can't Lucas make one goddamn movie where Idon't have to either stomach something , forgive something, overlook something, pretend that didn't happen, fast forward through that part, cover my ears, scratch out my eyes.... Suttytx 05-09-2005, 04:02 PM The Tarzan yell and the Sarlac burp in ROTJ are the two lowest points of humor in the OT for me.  Hate to see it repeated in ROTS. Samurai Mike 05-09-2005, 05:06 PM The Tarzan yell and the Sarlac burp in ROTJ are the two lowest points of humor in the OT for me.  Hate to see it repeated in ROTS. The sarlacc burp was okay until Lucas changed the creature to the Penis From Hell. Now it farts instead (and has teeth around its arse, or something). Litmus Configuration 05-09-2005, 10:03 PM Ithought Imight have heard the Tarzan yell buried beneath a shot when a Wookiee jumps on a Seperatist vehicle but it was so covered over with other sound effects and music, Icouldn't be sure. (To be honest, most of the Kashyyk stuff didn't really engage me, so Idon't remember a lot of the little details.) And yeah, just because the Tarzan yell was in JEDI doesn't mean that it was ever a good idea. Tom Roberts 05-09-2005, 11:09 PM 91% at Rotten Tomatoes at the moment (22 reviews). That seems pretty strong to me. devincf 05-10-2005, 01:15 AM 22 reviews is nothing. wadew1 05-10-2005, 01:33 AM Yeah, only 200 more reviews for Rottentomatoes to tally up. Andre Dellamorte 05-10-2005, 02:05 AM At this point, I'd expect mostly positives, that seems to eb the way of the film right now, but, yeah, you're counting the eggs at this point. devincf 05-10-2005, 02:11 AM It'll go fresh, btw. We've been pummeled by the last two so an OK Star Wars film, which this is, will get a good rating. Hell, my review (3000 words. Sorry in advance) will be rated fresh on RT. Andre Dellamorte 05-10-2005, 02:23 AM And since both previous PT films have fresh ratings, Ithink this one should easily follow. What that has to do with anything... Andrew Ellis 05-10-2005, 02:50 AM Ithink the Tarzan yell is pretty funny if it's now presented to have a history as a traditional Wookiee battle cry. Tom Roberts 05-10-2005, 06:38 AM 22 reviews is nothing. While Iunderstand your point, it's not nothing. It still indicates that this will be very well received critically. I'll bet you $5 (aus) that it settles above 80%. mastronikolas 05-10-2005, 08:22 AM Devin & Dre, you will simply not rest until the world sways to your point of view, eh? Is it that difficult to agree to disagree with others? mclihah2 05-10-2005, 09:12 AM Back on topic: The script seemed to have a lot of not-so-subtle remarks that related directly to today's political and military situation.  Until now, Star Wars has really been a reflection on past political/military conflicts (like the Third Reich) and this marks a noticable turn towards current events. Not quite! If you look at what the Bush administration is doing, it's a simple case of using a tried and tested technique that has always worked in the past. To sum up in 2 keywords \"Misinformation\" and \"Fear\" This technique has been used throughout history, and if you look at pretty much any tyrannical opressive power, you will see the same patter. George Orwell summed it up perfectly in 1984, an amazing and almost prophetic book, that can be summed up with the above words \"Misinformation\" and \"Fear\". This is also the technique Palpatine is using HITLER Misinformation - \"We're good, clean, white people, and we love Germany, freedom and democracy\" Fear - \"Those Jews are gunno infect us, they're animals - Kill em all\" PALPATINE Misinformation -\" I'm a good guy and Ilove the republic, and freedom and democracy\" \"Fear\" - \"Those seperatists are gunno get us - Give me more powers\" BUSH Misinformation - \"I Love Freedom, and Justice, and Truth, and Liberty\" Fear - \"Those Terrorists are gunno get us - we better invade their countries to stop em\" It's nothing new, just a tried and tested technique!! Litmus Configuration 05-10-2005, 09:16 AM Devin & Dre, you will simply not rest until the world sways to your point of view, eh? Idon't think they're trying to force their opinions on anyone so much as they're just pointing out that not everyone considers EP3 a \"masterpiece\" and that most of the positive reviews (so far) don't either.  Ithink the overwhelming majority of people who see EP3 will consider it a notable improvement over the last two Prequels (Isure as hell do) but that doesn't mean it still doesn't have its own troubling flaws that are just as worth discussing as its positive attributes.  Checks and balances.  That's all. Is it that difficult to agree to disagree with others? If that happens, then this message board runs out of gas pretty damn quick. devincf 05-10-2005, 09:18 AM Devin & Dre, you will simply not rest until the world sways to your point of view, eh? Is it that difficult to agree to disagree with others? Seriously, what are you talking about? There are 22 reviews. When it's all said and done there will be ten times that many on the site. 22 is a drop in the bucket. What is it about the basic mathematics of this that you don't understand? Stop being an apologist for one minute and understand how some people might be able to look at things like \"numbers\" and not see an attack on your precious films. gl2899 05-10-2005, 09:44 AM Devin & Dre, you will simply not rest until the world sways to your point of view, eh? Is it that difficult to agree to disagree with others? No, but apparantly you have a problem with Devin and Dre having their opinion. Christ, Devin said it was an \"OK\" Star Wars movie, he didn't trash it. So, does he have to kiss it's figurative ass to meet you approval? It seems that you're being guilty of what you're accusing Devin and Andre of.... Just sayin' Andre Dellamorte 05-10-2005, 12:28 PM Devin & Dre, you will simply not rest until the world sways to your point of view, eh? Is it that difficult to agree to disagree with others? Abunch of the rviews on RT are positive for a highly anticipated summer event film? Shock, surprise! The bulk of the RT stuff comes from a release date, and if one is using RT as a measuring stick, then it's best to wait until then. Because, arguably, the early reviews are coming from online sources, and the real meat and potatoes of RT are the print journalists. Ithink the problem with this approach at this juncture is using something meaningless to get excited about these movies. Be excited, be hopeful. If that's your bag, go with it, but...

RT is fairly useless at any point of the process, except maybe just as a long-term reference tool, or a collection of hyperlinks (much the same way that Iview Drudge). Ithink the only real shocker of any of the current reviews was Alexandra DuPont at AICN going kinda nutty for the film. She was about as savage on the prequels as anyone, but was entertaining and magnificently lucid in her critiques. Charlie Brigden 05-10-2005, 12:46 PM Yeah, Ithoroughly enjoyed her review. And the Daily Mail, because they slated it, which tells me there's a good chance I'll like it. Count Floyd 05-10-2005, 12:47 PM RT is way more useful as a review depositary than it is as any kind of thumbnail consensus.  Their Fresh/Rotten is too vague and arbitrary to be of much use, from what I've seen.  That having been said, there *is* a general \"B+\" vibe to the current reviews if you actually go in and read them.  It's not 200 reviews, but if you consider it a 10-15% sample than it's a halfway-decent bellwether.   Everyone seems to agree with what's good and what's bad about the movie, it's just a matter of degrees. gl2899 05-10-2005, 12:54 PM And Andre, It seems that we were right about the script. Everything I've heard from Nick, Devin, Russ and Steves reviews to the people that Iknow that went to the screening in Bloomfield Twp, MI tell me that the dialog we read in the script makes it's full on ham fisted appearance on film. What makes it so painfully obvious that Lucas is a shit writer is that the novelization was just so much better at telling HIS STORY! And Ihave a feeling that this entry of the franchise will fare worse over time than TPM or AOTC. Ialready have friends who after seeing the film, digesting it, and thinking it over, are more upset at the missed opportunities displayed here than the more obvious blunders of the earlier entries. And it's funny that Nick, Devin et al have echoed what my friends stated: It is an entertaining summer movie, but Star Wars used to mean more than that. Waker 05-10-2005, 01:06 PM No, but apparantly you have a problem with Devin and Dre having their opinion. Christ, Devin said it was an \"OK\" Star Wars movie, he didn't trash it. Actually, he did trash it. At length. Throughout several posts. Jason P. Thompson 05-10-2005, 01:07 PM Actually, he did trash it. At length. Throughout several posts.And if so, that's his opinion. Deal with it. The Dark Shape 05-10-2005, 01:28 PM For Devin thinking the film was \"OK,\" his review and just about everything he posted about Ep. III leans much more heavily towards the negative. And these reviews still strike me as damage control, so the reviewer can either come down on the positive or negative side once all is said and done.  After all, it's not like anyone would want to have a review contrary to popular opinion again, would they? Holy Diver 05-10-2005, 01:41 PM Especially not on CHUD. ;) Nothing wrong with having an opinion that's contrary to what's popular. But some reviewers just go out of their way to be negative. It's a cynical world we live in these days. Where people can't enjoy anything anymore without dissecting it and solely focusing on the ugly parts.  Ihate the kind of the review that's straddling the fence, there's nothing wrong with actually digging the shit out of a movie you know. The prequels have been fun as hell in my opinion. Come May 19th, it's the end of a great ride for a lot of us. Yes you can be a Star Wars fan and hate the prequels, gnash your teeth and call Lucas a fucking hack. Or you can put that blast shield down and reach out with your feelings. :) Life's too short to be a negative nerfherder. :D Waker 05-10-2005, 04:37 PM And if so, that's his opinion. Deal with it. Learn to read. My post doesn't exist in a vacuum - it's a response to another, and calls it on its bullshit. Tom Roberts 05-10-2005, 05:31 PM IMHO Ithink RottenTomatoes is reallly interesting tool. Idon't take the Fresh / Rotten rating as an absolute, nothing like RT > 80% therefore i will see this film. As for the 22 reviews, sure there will be 200 reviews for a movie like star wars. But from looking at those 22 it's often good enough to get a trend that will indicate what the other 80-90% of reviews will be like. And that's why Iposted it. At 92% with 26 now.

All he had to do was admit that Star Wars fans scare the bejesus out of him. McGregors thoughts on the basement-dwelling fanboys were as follows: \"There's this huge following, which is weird. They have big meets and conventions, and Ifind it all a bit frightening. Once this guy met me at a stage door when Iwas doing a play in London. The guy yelled, 'Obi-Wan. Do you have any advice for a trainee Jedi?' Ijust said, 'No, don't be so ridiculous.' If McGregor thinks that constantly being asked to whip out his light saber is creepy, then he better prepare himself for the reaction hell get from his upcoming project Gnomeo and Juliet. Ewan will voice the character Gnomeo to Kate Winslets Juliet in the story of indoor gnome-outdoor gnome love (and, no, we absolutely did not make this up). Once McGregor gets a taste of those psychotic garden gnome fans, hell be begging to appear next to Mark Hamill at every Star Wars convention. The Sphinx 05-16-2005, 12:45 AM Spracht Scott (http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/05/16/movies/16star.html?hp). Pseudo-random excerpts: This is by far the best film in the more recent trilogy, and also the best of the four episodes Mr. Lucas has directed. That's right (and my inner 11-year-old shudders as Itype this): it's better than \"Star Wars.\" ... But every picture, however ravishing, needs a story, and the best way to appreciate how well this one succeeds is to consider the obstacles it must surmount in winning over its audience. First of all, though there are a few surprises tucked into the narrative (which Iwon't give away), everybody knows the big revelation of the end, since it was also the big revelation at the end of the previous trilogy: Darth Vader is Luke's father. We also know, for the most part, which of the major figures are going to survive the various perils they face. So an element of suspense is missing from the outset. More than that, the trajectory of the narrative cuts sharply against the optimistic grain of blockbuster Hollywood, in that we are witnessing a flawed hero devolving into a cruel and terrifying villain. It is a measure of the film's accomplishment that this process is genuinely upsetting, even if we are reminded that a measure of redemption lies over the horizon in \"Return of the Jedi.\" And while Mr. Christensen's acting falls short of portraying the full psychological texture of this transformation, Mr. Lucas nonetheless grounds it in a cogent and (for the first time) comprehensible political context. \"This is how liberty dies - to thunderous applause,\" Padm observes as senators, their fears and dreams of glory deftly manipulated by Palpatine, vote to give him sweeping new powers. \"Revenge of the Sith\" is about how a republic dismantles its own democratic principles, about how politics becomes militarized, about how a Manichaean ideology undermines the rational exercise of power. Mr. Lucas is clearly jabbing his light saber in the direction of some real-world political leaders. At one point, Darth Vader, already deep in the thrall of the dark side and echoing the words of George W. Bush, hisses at Obi-Wan, \"If you're not with me, you're my enemy.\" Obi-Wan's response is likely to surface as a bumper sticker during the next election campaign: \"Only a Sith thinks in absolutes.\" You may applaud this editorializing, or you may find it overwrought, but give Mr. Lucas his due. For decades he has been blamed (unjustly) for helping to lead American movies away from their early-70's engagement with political matters, and he deserves credit for trying to bring them back. But of course the rise of the Empire and the perdition of Anakin Skywalker are not the end of the story, and the inverted chronology turns out to be the most profound thing about the \"Star Wars\" epic. Taken together, and watched in the order they were made, the films reveal the cyclical nature of history, which seems to repeat itself even as it moves forward. Democracies swell into empires, empires are toppled by revolutions, fathers abandon their sons and sons find their fathers. Movies end. Life goes on.That's a solid three stars at the very least. Interesting that Scott thinks the middle-is-the-end chronology of the two trilogies works... that it not only works, but resonates with the whole 'Force' theme of Star Wars. I'm a little encouraged by that review. It's a better explanation for liking the film than 'Darth Vader's in it!' and 'Wow, it looks just like the original Star Wars at the end!' On the other hand, Iwonder if Scott is just a little giddy over the idea that Lucas is putting George Bush's words in Darth Vader's mouth. Good fun for liberals like myself, but not necessarily right for Star Wars. Samurai Mike 05-16-2005, 03:20 AM Isn't it funny how Padme comments on loss of liberty, when it was HER fucking off and giving Jar Jar the vote in AOTC that led to it!! She complains about genocide in TPM, then shrugs her shoulders when Anakin admits to it in the second film. And Ihear she has even LESS to do in this one, other than gestate. Thats stupid. smugbug 05-16-2005, 03:59 AM Oh c'mon.  If you can stomach it on ROTJ, you can stomach it here.  It's as if people must have their SW totally humorless.  So Lucas can't tell a joke to save his ass, get over it. Iintend on seeing this flick after consuming the sufficient amount of beer.  By \"sufficient\" Imean, whatever amount necessary that it would make me at least laugh out loud to even the bad jokes. Hmmmmm....and thats the dilemma.  Not enough beer, and Iwill feel my ass getting numb.  Too much, and I'll just pass out and miss the whole thing.  Er....my vote is for too much. Beer seems to be the necessary item so that someone could tolerate this movie.  Hey, is there even a \"beer drinking game\" possible in this installment? Micah Robinson 05-16-2005, 12:31 PM The Ebert review is up: http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050515/REVIEWS/50503002 Also, I'm going to close this thread and start with a fresh clean slate shortly before the Wednesday midnight screenings. Ahoatam 05-16-2005, 12:59 PM On the other hand, Iwonder if Scott is just a little giddy over the idea that Lucas is putting George Bush's words in Darth Vader's mouth. Good fun for liberals like myself, but not necessarily right for Star Wars. This is what I'm trying to get at.  While most of the folks here probably won't mind, and even enjoy such thinly-veiled criticism of the current administration, Ithink to a decent portion of the population it may come across as extreme partisanship.  While many of you have illustrated Lucas' political subtexts in other SW films, Ithink it's a lot more in-your-face in ROTS, which is very un-Star Wars. So forgetting the fact that the film may endorse your own personal view of the current administration (by your own, Imean anyone here), it is wise for Lucas to risk dis-associating half of his audience who simply wanted to see the end of a space opera and not an idictment on the guy they voted for and maybe still have faith in?  Seriously, not looking for a political lecture here, because no one's going to change anyone's mind, just looking  for some honest looks at what this means for Star Wars. Granted, it could be argued that Lucas had this story set in '99, before Bush, but Ithink the sudden thrust of politics to the center of the Star Wars stage warrants some discussion. cognizant 05-16-2005, 01:24 PM The emphasis on politics in this trilogy was not needed, it surely wasnt essential to tell a story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker with politics involved.  The trilogy could have just focused on him and Obi 1.  The Emperor and his political manoeuvres could has just been vaguely hinted at in the background of the universe.  Ithink the focus on politics was in part, written to raise SW slightly above that often derided concept of 'mass popular culture' to be taken slightly more seriously by adults and prehaps be perceived as something even integral, or meaningful to culture, rather than something to simply escape to for a few hours, but obviously Lucas has failed at this, the story has suffered as a result.  Seeing geeky teenagers talk to news crew on TV about how this is an important Shakespearean tragic tale is laughable. SW shouldnt be taken seriously, its an escapist adventure tale without logic, but full of spunk.  Well, the first trilogy was anyway.  The second trilogy appears to me as a schizophrenic mish mash of mediocre sci-fi, and the frantic attempts of an ageing man trying to update/modify/remix his legacy. Micah Robinson 05-16-2005, 01:35 PM That's just silly. You can't depict the creation of a dictator-led military empire without focusing on politics. Anakin's turn occurs within this context, not outside of it. Besides, Palpatine's machinations were scripted and depicted BEFORE Bush's war on Iraq. Besides, the Jedi are the UN, and they certainly don't come off as heroic, smart, or helpful in the least in this film, so there's criticism of the Right and the Left to be found in spades. If people can only see the obvious Bush metaphors, then they're not even really looking at the film. Charlie Brigden 05-16-2005, 01:37 PM The emphasis on politics in this trilogy was not needed, it surely wasnt essential to tell a story of the rise and fall of Anakin Skywalker with politics involved.

Seeing geeky teenagers talk to news crew on TV about how this is an important Shakespearean tragic tale is laughable. Idisagree. The trilogy isn't just about Anakin, but also the Empire, and especially since Palpatine plays such an important role in Anakin's development and eventual turn, all of Palpatine's maneouverings are entirely necessary. For example, showing him getting into the chancellor's position, his growing influence over the Jedi, and subsequent acts against them. It's also the most interesting stuff in all of the prequels. To be fair, ever since the 70s and the whole journal of the whills deal, the rise of the Empire has always been described as this big corruption of politics. Ithink saying it's trying to be taken seriously by including politics is overly-cynical. Litmus Configuration 05-16-2005, 01:45 PM Actually, Iwould liked to have seen more of Palpatine's politics and less of Jar Jar's...well, anything.  All of that precious screen time, wasted.  (And that's not another tired criticism of what a terrible character Jar Jar is...more like a criticism of Lucas' storytelling priorities.)  When Palpatine and Anakin discuss the Sith during the opera, Iactually leaned forward in my theater seat.  More of the phantom menace's origins would have been appreciated by this viewer. mastronikolas 05-16-2005, 01:52 PM The politics were absolutely necessary for the story. There's a clear parallel between the Republic rotting from the inside and turning into a dictatorship and Anakin starting out as a decent person and turning into evil incarnate. And ultimately, the Senate scenes were about 20 minutes of screen time out of six-and-a-half hours of story. cognizant 05-16-2005, 02:07 PM Meeeh, I'll concede that it works with emphasis on politics, just didnt work for me with this specific vision.  Besides, the OT hardly has any politics, and those films are meant to depict the end of an empire and the re-establishment of the status quo, or some type of equilibrium, and all we get is a few throwaway lines about some senate or something. Istill think the PT could have worked without any direct emphasis on politics, it just would have been in the background, like online political debates/campaign adverts, or news of conflicts or coup de tat's, that characters would watch ocassionally to keep up to date with the situation, or the presence of stormtroopers slowly multiplying in more and more worlds, etc, it just could have been done subtlely, rather than the way we've seen it. And I'll admit, that when it comes to SW, I'm very cynical, but Icant help it, the over the top, and increasinly ridiculous merchandise aspect just leaves me cold. Micah Robinson 05-16-2005, 02:19 PM Yes, relegating Ian McDarmid - the shining jewel of this installment according to almost every review, even the negative ones - to a less prominent role would certainly help the current Star Wars films work better. Slice his screentime in half and let's have some more witty battle droid banter. Charlie Brigden 05-16-2005, 02:20 PM Because the merchandise levels of the OT were low? The point is, the OT never had politics because it was a different time. The Emperor dissolves all the diplomatic bits early in ANH, with Tarkin stating \"the remnants of the Old Republic have been swept away.\" This is the point, that any chance of democracy, of change has been completely and utterly destroyed, giving the motivation for the whole movement of the Rebellion. devincf 05-16-2005, 02:28 PM Because the merchandise levels of the OT were low?

Do you think all the reps in whatever made up the rebellion high command (we don't even know their power structure! But we know all about the power structure of the old republic...) agreed from campaign to campaign? Weren't our heroes in the OT close enough to that power structure that we should have been in on these debates at least as much as we were in the PT? This \"it's a function of the story\" stuff is bullshit. Charlie Brigden 05-16-2005, 02:38 PM Okay, everything is marketing. Igive up. ElCapitanAmerica 05-16-2005, 02:38 PM Apologist! Heretic!

Jacob Singer 05-16-2005, 02:40 PM From CNN: (http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/16/cannes.starwars/index.html) Lucas on Iraq war, 'Star Wars' From CNN's Chris Burns Monday, May 16, 2005 Posted: 10:12 AM EDT (1412 GMT) CANNES, France (CNN) -- \"Star Wars\" director George Lucas says that although he wrote the original film during the Vietnam War, his six-part saga could apply to the war in Iraq. ''In terms of evil, one of the original concepts was how does a democracy turn itself into a dictatorship,'' Lucas told a news conference at Cannes, where his final episode had its world premiere. ''The parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we're doing in Iraq now are unbelievable. ''On the personal level it was how does a good person turn into a bad person, and part of the observation of that is that most bad people think they are good people, they are doing it for the right reasons,'' he added. More at the link. The Dark Shape 05-16-2005, 02:47 PM Apologist! There's plenty of political stuff going on during a rebellion.

Weren't our heroes in the OT close enough to that power structure that we should have been in on these debates at least as much as we were in the PT? This \"it's a function of the story\" stuff is bullshit. Okay, Devin.  How should Lucas have shown the collapse of a government without politics being involved? devincf 05-16-2005, 02:50 PM I'm not remotely interested in writing a new PT. All you need are a couple of lines, similar to the \"He dissolved the senate\" line from the first star wars. The Dark Shape 05-16-2005, 03:00 PM You can't cheat like that when your main villain is the man taking over the government. ilmandthx 05-16-2005, 03:01 PM Iconsider myself an apologist with a conscience.  Ilike the prequels for what they are, but Iknow in my gut they could've been so much more.  Ireally wish Lucas would've kept his producing hat on, directed the effects and animation sequences (where his true passions lie), and left the screenwriting and directing the actors to someone(s) who could interject a little humanity. Most of the ideas, themes, even design and set pieces in the PT are intellectually sound.  The problem is that no one feels anything.  And if they do, generally its out of a sense of nostalgia rather than immediate tugging at the heartstrings. Lucas is a master visualist.  He also has a pretty good sense of story structure and has some really innovative ideas.  The problem is the guy is admittedly impatient when it comes to the writing and directing processes. The politics of the PT are an interesting inclusion to the SW storyline, but they are far too talky and overcomplicated for their own good.  Much like this post.  Ahem, there is no immediate drama involved in the politics until ROTS.  That to me, is a huge mistake. The PT as well as Matrix: Reloaded and Matrix: Revolutions are examples of first draft scripts, directors with too much power and no one to check them, and misplaced priorities.  Best intentions, even when they are completely revealed via commentaries, interviews, etc., cannot make up for lackluster execution. Remember that old Godzilla dig that ILM had?  PLOT DOES MATTER?  How about DRAMA DOES MATTER? devincf 05-16-2005, 03:12 PM You can't cheat like that when your main villain is the man taking over the government. No, that's the main villain of the PT where boring politics are the forefront. A PT with less politics could have had the Emperor in as minimal a role as he had in the OT. Micah Robinson 05-16-2005, 03:14 PM No, that's the main villain of the PT where boring politics are the forefront. A PT with less politics could have had the Emperor in as minimal a role as he had in the OT. No thanks. McDarmid's evolution from Senator to Chancellor to Emperor is not only one of the best parts of the PT, but also the perfect platform for illustrating the arrogance and flaws of the Jedi. Now, the separatist talks, along with the other irrelevant races and the senate debates could have been minimized for sure. But anything subtracting from McDarmid's screentime hurts these movies, IMHO. cognizant 05-16-2005, 03:28 PM No thanks. McDarmid's evolution from Senator to Chancellor to Emperor is not only one of the best parts of the PT, but also the perfect platform for illustrating the arrogance and flaws of the Jedi. Of course in my re-imagining of the PT, the Jedi would not have been the wankers we have seen them to be.  Making them incredibly dull, brainless and flawed, makes their downfall so much easier to write.  Its harder to creatively bring about the downfall of something thats working right, but Lucas... Anyway my opinion still stands, the story of Anakin's fall did not need focus on politics, or even the Emperor, as Devin says, this I'm sure is a minority opinion, but Ithink still a valid one, any one of us could come up with three screenplays that could be on par with the OT without resorting to real world political allegories.  Well not any one of us, but you get the jist.  If we were basing the PT off of what we'd seen in the OT, all we'd essentially need, is the Clone Wars, and thats it. Defending the focus on politics, simply because of McDarmid's performance, surely means that everything else was bollocks.  I'd rather downsize his role, in exchange for a better trilogy of films as a whole, with an exciting, original and involving narrative. Ahoatam 05-16-2005, 03:35 PM From the very beginning, the PT is infused with overly complicated politics, when in the OT there were virtually none.  Dispute over the taxation of trade routes?  Wat??? Why can't we give Padme a couple of throwaway lines to cover what's going on in the Senate?  \"Okay, Anakin, pookie, I'm going to go vote against the creation of a republic army, because that would give the Chancellor a chance to be naughty.  See you later.\" dudalb 05-16-2005, 04:22 PM Ithink where Lucas shoots himself in the foot with his political commentary is in Obi Wan's reply \"Only the Sith Deal in Absolutes\". Considering that for five films one of the basis is a very absolute idea of good vs evil (Empire/Sith Bad, Republic/Jedi Good) it's a little late to be condemning absolutes. Areply from Obi Wan like \"You are truly from the Dark Side, Chacellor\" would have been a hell of a lot better. Lucas leaves himself wide open with that remark. Samurai Mike 05-16-2005, 05:19 PM Of course in my re-imagining of the PT, the Jedi would not have been the wankers we have seen them to be.  Making them incredibly dull, brainless and flawed, makes their downfall so much easier to write.  Its harder to creatively bring about the downfall of something thats working right, but Lucas... Totally agree with that. How could a group of such ignorant, close-minded, arrogant and just downright stupid people be the guardians of peace and justice for over a thousand generations? The prequels make it seem as if the Jedi were the architects of their own fate, rather than anything the Sith did. That could work, if only the last film wasn't called 'Return of the Jedi', where the Sith are brought down by Ewoks. And about the politics, Ithink there should have been a political aspect to the PT, just not the boring, oversimplified and poorly thought out politics we've seen. The Republic was brought down by ONE man so cunning, the other trillions of creatures around him didn't suspect a thing? And don't even get me STARTED on Yoda \"Ican sense the Dark Side but not when its sitting right in front of me\". ElCapitanAmerica 05-16-2005, 05:26 PM Ithink where Lucas shoots himself in the foot with his political commentary is in Obi Wan's reply \"Only the Sith Deal in Absolutes\". Considering that for five films one of the basis is a very absolute idea of good vs evil (Empire/Sith Bad, Republic/Jedi Good) it's a little late to be condemning absolutes. Areply from Obi Wan like \"You are truly from the Dark Side, Chacellor\" would have been a hell of a lot better. Lucas leaves himself wide open with that remark. You make the same point on multiple threads, so I'm not sure were you want to read the reply to your silly point. Iwrote something in the ep3 thread in franchises; http://chud.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1468498#post1468498 dudalb 05-16-2005, 05:41 PM Totally agree with that. How could a group of such ignorant, close-minded, arrogant and just downright stupid people be the guardians of peace and justice for over a thousand generations? The prequels make it seem as if the Jedi were the architects of their own fate, rather than anything the Sith did. That could work, if only the last film wasn't called 'Return of the Jedi', where the Sith are brought down by Ewoks. And about the politics, Ithink there should have been a political aspect to the PT, just not the boring, oversimplified and poorly thought out politics we've seen. The Republic was brought down by ONE man so cunning, the other trillions of creatures around him didn't suspect a thing? And don't even get me STARTED on Yoda \"Ican sense the Dark Side but not when its sitting right in front of me\". Iagree. Ithink that Lucas meant to show that the Jedi had, with the rest of the Republic, had declined to the point where they were vulnerable to the Sith, a la Rome and the Barbarians,but he blew that concept completely. And i repeat that his blacks are too blacks and whites are too white for Lucas to start screaming about absolutes at this point in time. ElCapitanAmerica 05-17-2005, 12:45 AM The Republic was brought down by ONE man so cunning, the other trillions of creatures around him didn't suspect a thing? Uh .. in the original trilogy, the rebellion beats the empire because of a Tatooine farm boy. Litmus Configuration 05-17-2005, 12:53 AM Uh .. in the original trilogy, the rebellion beats the empire because of a Tatooine farm boy. Vader kills The Emperor. Han and Leia blow up the shield generator. Lando and Wedge blow up the Death Star's main reactor. Random A-Wing pilot takes out The Executor. Rebel pilots, troops and (gulp!) Ewoks killed or captured countless Imperial troops. What exactly did Luke do, aside from settling some very important personal business? ElCapitanAmerica 05-17-2005, 12:55 AM Vader kills the Emperor because of Luke. The Emperor manipulates everybody to control the galaxy. Simple. Litmus Configuration 05-17-2005, 12:57 AM Vader kills the Emperor because of Luke. The Emperor manipulates everybody to control the galaxy. Simple. Vader killing The Emperor would have been moot in a few minutes anyway, once Lando and Wedge blew up the main reactor. D. Richard 05-17-2005, 04:59 AM ok Ijust read most of the thread, and having just finished watching the film Istill don't understand the anakin conception deal. Palpatine tells Anakin a story of a great Darth lord that knew the darisk side of the force so well he could blah blah blah midichlorians blah blah with merely a look.  All right, so according to the story, Darth Plagus (Plagius, Plageus? whatev) conceived Anakin while Sidious was his apprentice.  Sidious murders his master in his sleep and takes over the Anakin plot himself.  That's what Igot from it. And assuming Palpatine is lying and did the whole scheme himself seems like a pointless assumption.  \"Because Palpatine is a liar, and liars lie.\"?  Not good enough.  He plainly speaks of this great Darth lord getting axed in his sleep by his apprentice as if he was the one who did it.  If we can believe that  part, why can we not believe that Palpatine wasn't the telepathic sperm donor? Ithink the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up stories that take away from his supposed genius. Rene A. Moncivais 05-17-2005, 09:57 AM Ididn't know Jerry Jones was in this? MrMushnik 05-17-2005, 10:01 AM \"Because Palpatine is a liar, and liars lie.\"?  Not good enough.  He plainly speaks of this great Darth lord getting axed in his sleep by his apprentice as if he was the one who did it.  If we can believe that  part, why can we not believe that Palpatine wasn't the telepathic sperm donor? Ithink the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up stories that take away from his supposed genius. Good liars mix their lies with the truth though.  He could be telling Anakin the truth about his master and at the same time leading Anakin to believe that he is the one responsible for his creation.  That way he hooks Anakin with the \"creating life\" part and then goes on and pits himself against Obi-Wan as a father figure.  And plus we've alrady seen more or less the same scenario in Episdode 2 when Dooku tries to recruit Obi-Wan. Litmus Configuration 05-17-2005, 10:09 AM Ithink the concept of Palpatine as an opportunistic apprentice who murders his master is far more appealing than the one of him making up stories that take away from his supposed genius. Iagree.  This whole silly \"Palpatine is lying\" theory is incredibly thin.  Besides, Obi-Wan has told far more lies than Palpatine.  \"Certain point of view,\" my ass.  I'd wager that if you took all of Palpatine's dialogue from the films and do the same with Obi-Wan, Palpy would win the \"Who's More Truthful?\" contest hands down. mastronikolas 05-17-2005, 10:17 AM The fact that Palpatine seduces Anakin by essentially  telling the truth (even if it is \"from a certain point of view\") is one of the most interesting facets of Sith. Besides, Idon't get the whole uproar about his \"revelation\". Ienjoy the fact that Lucas leaves it to us to choose if Palpatine was behind Anakin's creation or not. Imuch prefer that than being spoon-fed a definite answer. Satan's Hamster 05-17-2005, 10:50 AM Iintend on seeing this flick after consuming the sufficient amount of beer.  By \"sufficient\" Imean, whatever amount necessary that it would make me at least laugh out loud to even the bad jokes. Hmmmmm....and thats the dilemma.  Not enough beer, and Iwill feel my ass getting numb.  Too much, and I'll just pass out and miss the whole thing.  Er....my vote is for too much. Beer seems to be the necessary item so that someone could tolerate this movie.  Hey, is there even a \"beer drinking game\" possible in this installment? Don't go crying if you get alcohol poisoning! Ithink there sould be a drinking game where you have to do a shot of vodka every time someone says something stupid, in which case, should you die after seeing the film and you were too be cremated, your body would burn for three months!!! mastronikolas 05-17-2005, 10:55 AM Smugbug and little fury fourteen-year-old, Ienvy your prescient abilities. Satan's Hamster 05-17-2005, 11:20 AM First of all you fucking twats, there was no need for politics in the OT because The Empire had been in control for close to 20 years and Idoubt that the Rebellion would have very successful by launching a political attack when the Emperor would just fry their ass with Sith Lightning. If this was Mr. Skywalker Goes To Washington, A New Hope wouldn't have been about trying to destroy a Death Star, it would have been about Luke going to the Galactic senate and making his case that the Empire is evil and that the Emperor and Darth Vader were very naughty men while wagging his finger at them as the senate hiss and boo as they slide into the shadows. Politics are at the very heart of how Palpatine takes over the senate and to ignore that for more space battles would be stupid and Im quite sure that most of the people that are bitching and moaning about the politics here are Republicans and they dont particularly like looking into the mirror because theyre all fucking monkeys with their eyes, mouth and ears closed! Satan's Hamster 05-17-2005, 11:31 AM Another thing fuckwads, how the hell did you think Hitler got to power. He didn't wake up one morning as leader of the Nazi party. When Lucas was writing the OT I'm sure Hitler's rise might of influenced him SOMEWHAT given that he's Jewish, DONTCHA THUNK, and the similarities to George W. Bush are just a happy little coincidence. kittyinjammies 05-17-2005, 11:37 AM Hey, Hamster.  Cool it, ok?

MattCG 05-17-2005, 04:57 PM Saw this last night and overall Iagree that this is best prequel yet, but that's not saying a whole lot.  It's still a troubled film, with some scenes that are so embarrassingly bad that you're ashamed to be in the theater.  Still, the good outweighs the bad and the prequel lovers will love it and the haters will have some of theri goodwill won back. That said, this movie has got serious fucking issues.  The main being Hayden Christiansen and his Smarm/Assfucker/Whine approach to acting.  If someone could kill him?  That would be great. The other being C-3P0.  Sweet Jesus. Also, Iwould've thought Anakin's fall to the Dark Side would've been handled with a little more......skill.  What we have here is the equivalent of \"I'm a Dark Lord of Sith.......NOW!\" It's total bullshit. All in all, a mostly fun movie and lots of prayers the Lucas NEVER BE ALLOWED TO DIRECT ANYTHING EVER, EVER AGAIN!!!! robotpals 05-18-2005, 02:00 PM \"Only the Sith Deal in Absolutes.\" An absolutist statement if Iever heard one.

Grandma Ilona Richardson, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho \n   Ilona Richardson (Coeur d'Alene, ID 83815) hrichardson@ispwest.com Michelle was an inspiration to me. She never gave up hope in her battle, she always had her sense of humor and made the best of the situation.. Icame in contact with Michelle last year when Iwas going through a colonoscopy to rule out colon cancer. Iwas very scared, being only 23 and having gone through this at a young age, she was able to relate to the anxiety and fear Iwas experiencing. She gave me hope and courage no matter what the outcome would be. Thankfully, Iwas clear, but later that year Ilost my grandmother and my grandfather both to cancer. They were both only in their 60's and they raised me, so this was like losing my parents. Her words gave me strength, and her story inspired me to make the most of every day and to live my life to the fullest. Iwill truly miss Michelle and my thoughts and prayers go out to her grieving family as Iunderstand what they are going through. May they find some peace in knowing Michelle is no longer suffering.

Ifigured she was doing poorly and just didn't want to be seen or to have to talk about it. \n\nMichelle was first diagnosed while she was directing my play in the Minnesota Fringe Festival. Even while she was in treatment she went ahead and directed the show. Throughout her entire illness, with every setback she was still fighting, taking lessons, auditioning, etc. Iwas continually amazed at her will to live and keep going.

Iam utterly devastasted that she is no longer with us. It is so unfair that such a beautiful person had such a short life. Ifound her site when Iwas first diagnosed & everything she went through at first was identical to what Iwas going through. She helped me so much when Ithought Icouldn't get through this. She would e-mail when Iwas down & give me encouragement. She gave me such hope & now Iam just totally devastated. Ifeel so bad that Ijust found out now. Ijust want her family to know that Iprayed for her daily & that you should be so proud & were so lucky to have had such a wonderful & beautiful angel in your life. Iknow that she is looking down on all of us that she helped & loved & she will continue to help us. My heart is hurting so much right now. Even though Ionly talked to her on-line, Iconsidered her a dear friend. My hope was to meet her in person one day. Iwill miss her more than words can say. Idon't know how I'm going to get through this without her. Thank you to her family for sharing her with us. God Bless You All! Love, Maria Maria Bozzarelli (Mt.

When times are good\r\n    they \"invest\" the overpayment while it's available; when times are bad they need\r\n    the overpayment for \"safety nets\" and \"unmet needs.\" Then they come\r\n    back for more. But note the big error by the reporter when she states:\r\n    \"If Cellucci's pitch to reduce the income tax rate in stages from 5.95 percent to 5\r\n    percent is successful, it could take $1.2 billion out of the coffers in just the first\r\n    year...\" This is an inaccurate statement. Gov. Cellucci's plan would phase in his tax rate\r\n    reduction over three years; when fully implemented, in the third year, it would reduce\r\n    revenue by about $1.2 billion. Regardless, when the pols took the money from us with their \"temporary\"\r\n    rate increase, did anyone ask if you could afford it, or whether you'd rather if they\r\n    phased it in gradually over a number of years? And what's this \"take $1.2 billion out of the coffers\"? It shouldn't\r\n    still be going into the coffers! Chip Ford -- The Boston Globe Metro | Region Friday, February 25, 1999 Economists say state should temper spending Possible slowdown could squeeze budget By Tina Cassidy Globe Staff It was only a few months ago that Beacon Hill lawmakers, worried\r\n        about financial crises overseas and a spate of local layoffs, were talking about\r\n        belt-tightening, hoarding cash, and boosting the state's rainy day fund in anticipation of\r\n        a recession that some seemed certain was just over the horizon. But money kept pouring in. The political rhetoric about how many\r\n        months the $1.2 billion emergency reserves could sustain the state began to fade. Agendas\r\n        blossomed. Spending became the order of the day. Governor Paul Cellucci produced the largest budget ever filed in\r\n        Massachusetts history containing plans to lower the income tax rate and heap millions of\r\n        dollars on pet projects and programs. Weeks later he said he wanted to spend another $300\r\n        million from a projected state surplus on one-time road and bridge improvements. Even before Cellucci got the spending bug, Speaker Thomas M. Finneran\r\n        unveiled an ambitious and expensive plan to offer public preschool and full-day\r\n        kindergarten. And Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham cited the surging economy as a\r\n        reason to sharply increase the minimum wage. Despite the spending euphoria, economists are still nervous about the\r\n        not-too-distant future. They say fewer jobs will be created. The financial service sector\r\n        could be hit by a stock market crash. And consumer confidence may wane. \"One way or another, the economy is going to slow in '99,\"\r\n        says Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. \"It doesn't have to\r\n        go down the tubes like it did a decade ago.... Arecession is unlikely and Massachusetts\r\n        wouldn't do any worse than the rest of the country in terms of job loss and how long it\r\n        stayed down, but the fact that we haven't had a slowdown yet means people should be more\r\n        cautious, not less cautious.\" While Cellucci's budget message for next year is filled with warnings\r\n        about \"profligate spending\" and reminders \"of what can happen when\r\n        government gets caught up in the euphoria that prevails during a robust economy,\" his\r\n        record $20.4 billion spending plan represents a 5 percent boost over fiscal 1999, giving\r\n        across-the-board increases to dozens of agencies and programs. The Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, a fiscal watchdog group,\r\n        issued two reports last month, \"Reaching the Breaking Point: The Commonwealth's\r\n        Capital Dilemma\" and \"Budget '99: Containing the Euphoria,\" both flagging the potential for a crisis. \"We're still phasing in last year's tax cuts. The economy has\r\n        already outperformed everyone's expectation for much longer than anyone anticipated. This\r\n        clearly can't go on forever and there are some problems,\" said Michael Widmer,\r\n        executive director of the taxpayers foundation. He points to the so-called budget busters -- funding for the MBTA,\r\n        health care for state employees, and Medicaid -- climbing to unforeseen levels. \"The budget is exploding,\" Widmer added. \"At the same\r\n        time, we have this huge problem of trying to identify enough capital resources to invest\r\n        in a long list of important priorities while paying for the Central Artery.\" Last week, Cellucci said he would pour much of the state's cash\r\n        surplus into one-time highway and bridge projects, taking some of the pressure off the\r\n        capital budget. But such a spending luxury could be short-lived. The state's infrastructure -- roads, buildings, bridges, pipes, etc.\r\n        -- is among the oldest in the nation and could easily siphon millions out of the general\r\n        fund for needed repairs over the next few years. If Cellucci's pitch to\r\n        reduce the income tax rate in stages from 5.95 percent to 5 percent is successful, it\r\n        could take $1.2 billion out of the coffers in just the first year [sic] ,\r\n        possibly eliminating any surplus, thereby stretching the capital budget thinner. Frederick Breimyer, chief economist at State Street Bank who believes\r\n        the state's soaring times are in for a \"soft landing,\" said it is evident that\r\n        politicians are struggling to determine how to spend this year's cash without permanently\r\n        elevating expectations. \"Growth is likely to diminish,\" Breimyer said. \"The\r\n        political establishment here is trying to find a middle line. Ithink they've done a\r\n        reasonably good job. There has been a sense of prudence. And Ithink prudence is\r\n        warranted.\" However, cities and towns, which have received local aid increases\r\n        each of the last eight years -- a 113 percent overall jump in spending since 1992 -- are\r\n        already clamoring for more than the $4.5 billion Cellucci is offering for next year. Holyoke Mayor Daniel Szostkiewicz says major local aid increases over\r\n        the last four years have fueled a renaissance in his city, luring young families back who\r\n        once would have shunned the shabby schools, which now have new books and are wired for the\r\n        Internet. \"It was great. It was absolutely phenomenal,\" Szostkiewicz.\r\n        \"But when you go from multimillion dollar increases to level funding, it feels like\r\n        you're just hitting a wall.\" Of course, he is already talking about \"working the\r\n        Legislature\" on getting more than the $60 million Holyoke is already promised. All this frustrates the governor's office. \"You can't open the piggy bank for everyone all the time,\"\r\n        said Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene Hoffer. \"You have to impose controls. The most\r\n        critical way to do that is to take money off the table by reducing the income tax.\" Will the Legislature approve the rate cut? Senate President Birmingham hopes not. \"I'm not Nostradamus,\" he said. \"And Idon't know if\r\n        the governor has Nostradamus advising him. Idon't know when the economy will slow down\r\n        ... and for that reason Itake a cautious approach.\" NOTE: In accordance with Title 17 U.S.C.\r\n    section 107, this material is distributed without profit or payment to those who have\r\n    expressed a prior interest in receiving this information for non-profit research and\r\n    educational purposes only.

If you've ever read an old-school book on Mac programming like Scott Knaster's \"How to Write Macintosh Software\" you'll appreciate the power and simplicity of just drawing your user interface. (If you haven't played around with these tools yet, check out Erik J. Barzeski's \"Two Lines of Code\" article for a gentle introduction.) Cocoa's Interface Builder is even better than other \"visual interface\" toolkits like HyperCard, FaceSpan, and FileMaker's layout tools because what you create doesn't just try to imitate the feel of a Mac interface, it really is a Mac user interface. There are other toolkits on other platforms which offer this simplicity, but the Mac OS Xdeveloper tools will be the first time they have been freely available for all levels of Mac developers to use. In the past, Ihad tried unsuccessfully to master old-school Mac programming. Interface Builder was what convinced me that perhaps things were changing now and learning to program a Mac was an attainable goal for a scripter like me. There was a big gap for me though. Apple provides some good documentation for learning Objective-C, but they didn't write anything about learning standard ANSI C. This omission is intentional and understandable. Apple doesn't provide developer documentation to teach you how to touch type, use the mouse, or perform other \"basic\" pre-requisites. So it looked like Iwas going to have to start out either learning Cor Java before Icould get to anything remotely Apple relevent like Cocoa."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "// What About Java?"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When Istarted, Iwanted to learn Java. It was a language with a lot of industry \"buzz.\" It had huge class libraries already written. It had a syntax that was more understandable to my Hypercard and AppleScript roots than Cdid. And Ireally didn't fancy the idea of having to learn two languages (Cand Objective-C) before moving on to what Iwas really interested in. Ispent a lot of time finding good references on Java. If you want to pursue this route Ihighly recommend Bruce Eckel's \"Thinking In Java\" Second Edition ( http://www.bruceeckel.com/TIJ2/index.html ). It is one of the most readable and understandable introductions to Java, and ultimately it was why Igave up on the language for the time being. The book's CD-ROM includes a multimedia introduction to the Cprogramming language and encourages the reader learn the basics of Cfrom the tutorial before going very far into Java. This seemed odd at first, but after moving through the Ctutorial it really started to make sense. Learning Cis a good foundation for Java (and Objective-C). The Clanguage isn't terribly obscure or complex; it's a concise language that makes writing procedural code straightforward. And in both Objective-Cand Java, when you get down to the level \"inside\" the objects you still must be able to program in a traditional procedural fashion that's vey similar to standard C. What Idiscovered after learning some of the basics about Cwas that Objective-Cwas a very simple step beyond standard C. Java has some nice features and, one day, Iwill go back and try to learn it. Java's wide assortment of class libraries, industry-wide acceptance (including WebObjects), and garbage collection scheme make me curious about whether it would be a better language to use. But for my learning purposes, Objective-Cwas a very simple step forward. If you already know Java, your decision will likely be different, but if you are as new to \"real\" programming as Iam, you may find that Objective-Cis the simpler path."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "// What You Need to Know"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At first, Iresisted even writing this section. Cisn't terribly complicated and if you try to learn it on a \"need to know\" basis you probably won't really be learning it but just checking items off on your list. To start though, you should learn how to write C, don't try to learn Cby reading other people's code. Ilearned lots of scripting languages by reading samples and scripts of others, but this didn't work well for C. After people get the hang of writing C, they start taking shortcuts to make typing easier. When Iwas just starting out, Ifound that Iended up doing more decoding of these examples than actual learning. What was worse was that sometimes my decoding was wrong and I'd end up very confused. You'll be much better off following a tutorial and writing out your own code that is clear and understandable. As for the topics themselves: You should learn about the different types of variables and how to change one into another when needed. You should learn some of the basic string functions like printf, sscanf and strcopy, but Cocoa includes a lot of great string manipulation so there's not a need to get too in depth about string functions and techniques. You should learn how to read and use the order of operations table but it's probably not necessary to commit it to memory. You should learn about the various types of loops (while, for, and so on). You'll need to learn about some of the more advanced structures like enums and structs. And you will need to learn what a pointer is and how it's used is a good thing, though you probably don't need to learn a great deal of pointer arithmetic or pointer tricks. One topic that you may not want to get into (that many introductory courses cover) are the bit operations. Twiddling bits isn't something that's you have to do in Cocoa (but you can if you want). But Ifound the subject really helped me understand Cbetter. Nevertheless, if your goal is strictly Cocoa and calculating in base two makes your head hurt, you're probably safe skipping the subject."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "// References for Learning C"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Learning Ctakes some patience and attention.

And the \"The Waite Group's C Primer Plus\" is very helpful if you aren't familiar with programming in any form (AppleScript, FileMaker, Basic, etc). I'd also suggest looking at some book review sites (like Amazon) for some opinions of what other readers thought. I'd strongly recommend buying real books to learn from.

When you start making programs over fifty or a hundred lines long, then you probably will want to start taking typing shortcuts."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "// Differences from Scripting Languages"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Coming from the world of Mac scripting, some of the conventions of Cwere confusing for me. Here's a list of a few of them. They may or may not make sense to you yet, but if at some point you get flustered or confused someone else may have been there too. Choosing Sizes for Variables Some scripting languages make the user choose a type of variable (number, text, date) but few require the user to pick how big to make the variables. In Cyou must decide whether your variables will hold small or big numbers, lengths of text, and other \"sizing\" considerations. This can be flustering to a new programmer, but don't overthink yourself when you're getting started. \"Ineed to provide a variable to hold a name, but should it be able to hold Susan O'Donnel or Marguerite Elizabeth Wolverhampton-Morrell?\". If in doubt, choose something longer than you need. When you get more adept at the language you can learn how choosing the right size will help speed up your program and not use as much memory. But learning how to optimize Cis definitely something you need to learn after learning basic Cprogramming. There is no Symbol for Exponentiation If you look at a table of the order operations will be performed you will see the upper pointing caret '^' that's commonly used to denote exponentiation. Don't be fooled: the caret really represents a bit shifting operation (a very powerful but \"machine level\" sort of operation). If you want to use exponents you'll need to use a library such as math.h White Space Almost Doesn't Matter Some langauges like Python actually pay attention to the way you indent your code. Some tools like FileMaker or Hypercard read your code and put in the indentation that it wants based on what you've written. The Ccompiler (as you will learn) doesn't care at all about your indentation. Inded one of the things that can mess you up is paying too much attention to the indentation and not enough to what your code is actually saying. But even though the Ccompiler doesn't care about your indentation, other things do. In particular, the Cpreprocessor requires that some of it's directives be written in certain places. If your #define macro appears anywhere other than the start of a new line, there will be an error. Objects are not All the Same Since you probably will only learn Cto the extent that you will start using it to learn other object-oriented programing langauges, you might see reference made to objects and get confused. Don't. In ANSI Cthe term object refers to the machine code that's generated from the compiler just before the linking stage. These files aren't readable by a human and they end in '.o' (dot oh). Additionally, when you start getting into Objective C, C++, and Java you may start reading things about objects that don't fit with each other. You may share programming principles between the different languages. You may even have different \"langauge objects\" in your project, but they should be treated as ghosts in their own planes of existence. But in general it's good to think of objects seperate to their own context. Assignment is Just Another Operator Let X = X + 1 or Let Y = Y^Z + LOG (G) * SIN (T). In Applesoft Basic, Excel, Hypercard, FileMaker and many other scripting languages allow you to build very simple or elaborate assignment statements, but the last thing which will always happen is the assignment itself.  In C, an assignment is just another operation with a precedence just like addition, division, or parentheses. This gives you the flexibility to do some crazy things with assignments. It lets you put multiple assignments in an expression. It lets you perform an assignment, perform more operations, and then assign things to yet another expression. You can even build a very elaborate set of operations and then forget to actually assign the result to anything. Be careful. C Counts from Zero, not One The short snippet of text \"Wretched\" is eight characters long. If you want to take the first character of the string (in this case 'W') you would use an expression like =MID(A1,1,1) in Excel or Middle(\"Wretched\",1,1) in FileMaker. In C, a similar expression would get you the character 'r' because Cdoesn't count things starting with one. In most cases it starts counting with 0. Iasked a real Cprogrammer why this was. \"Isn't it more intuitive to start counting at 1?\" \"Why would you want to waste a number?\" \"Waste a number? isn't it arbitrary where the numbers start?\" \"Nope. All types, signs, and sizes of variables include zero in their range of acceptable values. If Cstarted counting at one you would loose the use of a whole digit.\" There may be other reasons beyond what my friend told me, but generally Ctries to do as little as possible that would artificially limit the machine even if it makes things a bit more complex for the programmer. That's a very different mentality from scripting languages which go to great ends to simplify the logic for the programmer. In truth, this isn't as big a deal as it seemed it would be when Ifirst discovered this counting scheme, but it did take me a while to get into that mindset. It may take you some time to do so as well. That about wraps up this topic. Be sure to look at some of the other tutorials for more information. In the meantime, get out there and learn C. Good Luck!"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Comments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Thank you for the information and guidance your article provides."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Ccounts from zero rather than one because it's just an offset from the base address of the array. Since the first element of array foo begins at the base address, the offset is zero, so we write foo[0], or *(foo+0), or *foo. The next element is one away from the base address, so it is referenced as foo[1], or *(foo+1). Another excellent book on Cis \"Expert C Programming,\" by Peter van der Linden. Incidentally, Mr. van der Linden's \"Just Java\" book is a nice gentle intro to Java, but it needs to be followed by the already-mentioned \"Thinking In Java\" from Bruce Eckel, or at least the O'Reilly book \"Java In A Nutshell\" by David Flanagan. Java is such a great language (once one understands the whole CLASSPATH thing) because it's so easy to learn and to use (so it's great as a first language), and it's plenty powerful for real-world development. That said, Iuse it only for server-side development.

{"file_number": "39", "plaintext": [{"tag": "h2", "text": "Relations with the United States"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Japan-United States relations were more uncertain in the early 1990s\n        than at any time since World War II. As long-standing military allies\n        and increasingly interdependent economic partners, Japan and the United\n        States cooperated closely to build a strong, multifaceted relationship\n        based on democratic values and interests in world stability and\n        development. Japan-United States relations improved enormously in the\n        1970s and 1980s, as the two societies and economies became increasingly\n        intertwined. In 1990 their combined gross national product (GNP) totaled about one third of the world's GNP. Japan received\n        about 11 percent of United States exports (a larger share than any other\n        country except Canada), and the United States bought about 34 percent of\n        Japan's exports. Japan had US$148 billion in direct\n        investment in the United States in 1991, while the United States had\n        more than US$17 billion invested in Japan. Some US$100 billion in United\n        States government securities held by institutions in Japan helped\n        finance much of the United States budget deficit. Economic exchanges\n        were reinforced by a variety of scientific, technical, tourist, and\n        other exchanges. Each society continued to see the other as its main\n        ally in Asia and the Pacific. Certain developments in the late 1980s\n        damaged bilateral relations. Nevertheless, public opinion surveys\n        continued to reveal that substantial majorities of Japanese and\n        Americans believed that the bilateral relationship was vital to both\n        countries. Growing interdependence was accompanied by markedly changing\n        circumstances at home and abroad that were widely seen to have created a\n        crisis in Japan-United States relations in the late 1980s. United States\n        government officials continued to emphasize the positive aspects of the\n        relationship but warned that there was a need for \"a new conceptual\n        framework.\" The Wall Street Journal publicized a series of\n        lengthy reports documenting changes in the relationship in the late\n        1980s and reviewing the considerable debate in Japan and the United\n        States over whether a closely cooperative relationship was possible or\n        appropriate for the 1990s. An authoritative review of popular and media\n        opinion, published in 1990 by the Washington-based Commission on\n        US-Japan Relations for the Twenty-first Century, was concerned with\n        preserving a close Japan-United States relationship. It warned of a\n        \"new orthodoxy\" of \"suspicion, criticism and considerable\n        self- justification,\" which it said was endangering the fabric of\n        Japan- United States relations. Three sets of factors stand out as the most important in explaining\n        the challenges facing Japan-United States relations. They are economic,\n        political-military, and domestic in nature. The relative economic power of Japan and the United States was\n        undergoing sweeping change, especially in the 1980s. This change went\n        well beyond the implications of the United States trade deficit with\n        Japan, which had remained between US$40 billion and US$48 billion\n        annually since the mid-1980s. The persisting United States trade and\n        budget deficits of the early 1980s led to a series of decisions in the\n        middle of the decade that brought a major realignment of the value of\n        Japanese and United States currencies. The stronger Japanese currency\n        gave Japan the ability to purchase more United States goods and to make\n        important investments in the United States. By the late 1980s, Japan was\n        the main international creditor. Japan's growing investment in the United States--it was the second\n        largest investor after Britain--led to complaints from some American\n        constituencies. Moreover, Japanese industry seemed well positioned to\n        use its economic power to invest in the high- technology products in\n        which United States manufacturers were still leaders. The United\n        States's ability to compete under these circumstances was seen by many\n        Japanese and Americans as hampered by heavy personal, government, and\n        business debt and a low savings rate. In the late 1980s, the breakup of the Soviet bloc in Eastern Europe\n        and the growing preoccupation of Soviet leaders with massive internal\n        political and economic difficulties forced the Japanese and United\n        States governments to reassess their longstanding alliance against the\n        Soviet threat. Officials of both nations had tended to characterize the\n        security alliance as the linchpin of the relationship, which should have\n        priority over economic and other disputes. Some Japanese and United\n        States officials and commentators continued to emphasize the common\n        dangers to Japan- United States interests posed by the continued strong\n        Soviet military presence in Asia. They stressed that until Moscow followed\n        its moderation in Europe with major demobilization and reductions in its\n        forces positioned against the United States and Japan in the Pacific,\n        Washington and Tokyo needed to remain militarily prepared and vigilant. Increasingly, however, other perceived benefits of close Japan-\n        United States security ties were emphasized. The alliance was seen as\n        deterring other potentially disruptive forces in East Asia, notably the\n        Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea). Ironically, some\n        United States officials noted that the alliance helped keep Japan's\n        potential military power in check and under the supervision of the\n        United States. The post-Cold War environment strengthened the relative importance of\n        economic prowess over military power as the major source of world\n        influence in the early 1990s. This shift affected the perceived relative\n        standing of Japan, the United States, and other powers. Increasingly,\n        Japan was expected to shoulder international aid and economic\n        responsibilities that in the past were discharged by the United States\n        and other Western countries. The declining Soviet threat, the rising power of the Japanese\n        economy, increasingly close United States interaction (and related\n        disputes) with Japan, and other factors led by 1990 to a decided shift\n        in United States opinion about Japan and to less marked but nonetheless\n        notable shifts in Japanese opinion. In the United States, this shift was\n        reflected in questions about which was the more serious, the military\n        threat from the Soviet Union or the economic challenge from Japan. In a\n        series of polls in 1989 and 1990, most respondents considered the\n        challenge from Japan the more serious. Similarly, poll data from early\n        1990 showed that most Japanese considered negative United States\n        attitudes toward Japan a reflection of United States anger at\n        \"America's slipping economic position.\" Meanwhile, Japanese\n        opinion was showing greater confidence in Japan's ability to handle its\n        own affairs without constant reference--as in the past--to the United\n        States. Japan's belief in United States reliability as a world leader\n        also lessened. In both countries, new or \"revisionist\" views of the Japan-\n        United States relationship were promoted. In Japan some commentators\n        argued that the United States was weak, dependent on Japan, and unable\n        to come to terms with world economic competition. They urged Japan to\n        strike out on a more independent course. In the United States, prominent\n        commentators warned of a Japanese economic juggernaut, out of control of\n        the Japanese government, which needed to be \"contained\" by the\n        United States. At the same time, it was easy to overstate the changes in opinion in\n        both countries. The Japanese still considered the United States\n        positively as their closest friend, the principal guardian of their\n        external security, their most important economic partner and market, and\n        the exemplar of a life-style that had much to offer--and much to envy.\n        Moreover, the vast majority of Americans still viewed Japan positively,\n        had high respect for Japanese accomplishments, and supported the United\n        States defense commitment to Japan. In the years after World War II, Japan's relations with the United\n        States were placed on an equal footing for the first time at the end of\n        the occupation by the Allied forces in April 1952. This equality, the\n        legal basis of which was laid down in the peace treaty signed by\n        forty-eight Allied nations and Japan, was initially largely nominal,\n        because in the early postoccupation period Japan required direct United\n        States economic assistance. Afavorable Japanese balance of payments\n        with the United States was achieved in 1954, mainly as a result of\n        United States military and aid spending in Japan. The Japanese people's feeling of dependence lessened gradually as the\n        disastrous results of World War II subsided into the background and\n        trade with the United States expanded. Self-confidence grew as the\n        country applied its resources and organizational skill to regaining\n        economic health. This situation gave rise to a general desire for\n        greater independence from United States influence. During the 1950s and\n        1960s, this feeling was especially evident in the Japanese attitude\n        toward United States military bases on the four main islands of Japan\n        and in Okinawa Prefecture, occupying the southern two-thirds of the\n        Ryukyu Islands. The government had to balance left-wing pressure advocating\n        dissociation from the United States against the realities of the need\n        for military protection. Recognizing the popular desire for the return\n        of the Ryukyu Islands and the Bonin Islands (also known as the Ogasawara\n        Islands), the United States as early as 1953 voluntarily relinquished\n        its control of the Amami group of islands at the northern end of the\n        Ryukyu Islands. But the United States made no commitment to return\n        Okinawa, which was then under United States military administration for\n        an indefinite period as provided in Article 3 of the peace treaty.\n        Popular agitation culminated in a unanimous resolution adopted by the\n        Diet in June 1956, calling for a return of Okinawa to Japan. Bilateral talks on revising the 1952 security pact began in 1959, and\n        the new Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security was signed in\n        Washington on January 19, 1960. When the pact was submitted to the Diet\n        for ratification on February 5, it became the subject of bitter debate\n        over the Japan-United States relationship and the occasion for violence\n        in an all-out effort by the leftist opposition to prevent its passage.\n        It was finally approved by the House of Representatives on May 20. Japan\n        Socialist Party deputies boycotted the lower house session and tried to\n        prevent the LDP deputies from entering the chamber; they were forcibly\n        removed by the police. Massive demonstrations and rioting by students\n        and trade unions followed. These outbursts prevented a scheduled visit\n        to Japan by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and precipitated the\n        resignation of Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke, but not before the treaty\n        was passed by default on June 19, when the House of Councillors failed\n        to vote on the issue within the required thirty days after lower house\n        approval. Under the treaty, both parties assumed an obligation to assist each\n        other in case of armed attack on territories under Japanese\n        administration. (It was understood, however, that Japan could not come\n        to the defense of the United States because it was constitutionally\n        forbidden to send armed forces overseas. In particular, the constitution\n        forbids the maintenance of \"land, sea, and air forces.\" It\n        also expresses the Japanese people's renunciation of \"the threat or\n        use of force as a means of settling international disputes\".\n        Accordingly, the Japanese find it difficult to send their\n        \"self-defense\" forces overseas, even for peace-keeping\n        purposes.) The scope of the new treaty did not extend to the Ryukyu\n        Islands, but an appended minute made clear that in case of an armed\n        attack on the islands, both governments would consult and take\n        appropriate action. Notes accompanying the treaty provided for prior\n        consultation between the two governments before any major change\n        occurred in the deployment of United States troops or equipment in\n        Japan. Unlike the 1952 security pact, the new treaty provided for a\n        ten-year term, after which it could be revoked upon one year's notice by\n        either party. The treaty included general provisions on the further\n        development of international cooperation and on improved future economic\n        cooperation. Both countries worked closely to fulfill the United States promise,\n        under Article 3 of the peace treaty, to return all Japanese territories\n        acquired by the United States in war. In June 1968 the United States\n        returned the Bonin Islands (including Iwo Jima) to Japanese\n        administration control. In 1969 the Okinawa reversion issue and Japan's\n        security ties with the United States became the focal points of partisan\n        political campaigns. The situation calmed considerably when Prime\n        Minister Sato Eisaku visited Washington in November 1969, and in a joint\n        communiqu signed by him and President Richard M. Nixon, announced the\n        United States agreement to return Okinawa to Japan in 1972. In June\n        1971, after eighteen months of negotiations, the two countries signed an\n        agreement providing for the return of Okinawa to Japan in 1972. The Japanese government's firm and voluntary endorsement of the\n        security treaty and the settlement of the Okinawa reversion question\n        meant that, two major political issues in Japan-United States relations\n        were eliminated. But new issues arose. In July 1971, the Japanese\n        government was surprised by Nixon's dramatic announcement of his\n        forthcoming visit to the People's Republic of China. Many Japanese were\n        chagrined by the failure of the United States to consult in advance with\n        Japan before making such a fundamental change in foreign policy. The\n        following month, the government was again surprised to learn that,\n        without prior consultation, the United States had imposed a 10 percent\n        surcharge on imports, a decision certain to hinder Japan's exports to\n        the United States. Relations between Tokyo and Washington were further\n        strained by the monetary crisis involving the December 1971 revaluation\n        of the Japanese yen. These events of 1971 marked the beginning of a new stage in\n        relations, a period of adjustment to a changing world situation that was\n        not without episodes of strain in both political and economic spheres,\n        although the basic relationship remained close. The political issues\n        between the two countries were essentially security-related and derived\n        from efforts by the United States to induce Japan to contribute more to\n        its own defense and to regional security. The economic issues tended to\n        stem from the ever-widening United States trade and payments deficits\n        with Japan, which began in 1965 when Japan reversed its imbalance in\n        trade with the United States and, for the first time, achieved an export\n        surplus. The United States withdrawal from Indochina in 1975 and the end of\n        the Second Indochina War meant that the question of Japan's role in the\n        security of East Asia and its contributions to its own defense became\n        central topics in the dialogue between the two countries. United States\n        dissatisfaction with Japanese defense efforts began to surface in 1975\n        when Secretary of Defense James A. Schlesinger publicly stigmatized\n        Japan as a passive defense partner. United States pressures continued and intensified, particularly as\n        events in Iran and elsewhere in the Middle East after 1979 caused the\n        United States to relocate more than 50 percent of its naval strength\n        from East Asian waters to the Indian Ocean. Japan was repeatedly pressed\n        not only to increase its defense expenditures and build up its\n        antisubmarine and naval patrol capabilities but also to play a more\n        active and positive security role generally. The Japanese government, constrained by constitutional limitations\n        and strongly pacifist public opinion, responded slowly to pressures for\n        a more rapid buildup of its Self-Defense Forces (SDF). It steadily\n        increased its budgetary outlays for those forces, however, and indicated\n        its willingness to shoulder more of the cost of maintaining the United\n        States military bases in Japan. In 1976 the United States and Japan\n        formally established a subcommittee for defense cooperation, in the\n        framework of a bilateral Security Consultative Committee provided for\n        under the 1960 security treaty. This subcommittee, in turn, drew up new\n        Guidelines for Japan-United States Defense Cooperation, under which\n        military planners of the two countries have conducted studies relating\n        to joint military action in the event of an armed attack on Japan. On the economic front, Japan sought to ease trade frictions by\n        agreeing to Orderly Marketing Arrangements, which limited exports on\n        products whose influx into the United States was creating political\n        problems. In 1977 an Orderly Marketing Arrangement limiting Japanese\n        color television exports to the United States was signed, following the\n        pattern of an earlier disposition of the textile problem. Steel exports\n        to the United States were also curtailed, but the problems continued as\n        disputes flared over United States restrictions on Japanese development\n        of nuclear fuel- reprocessing facilities, Japanese restrictions on\n        certain agricultural imports, such as beef and oranges, and\n        liberalization of capital investment and government procurement within\n        Japan. To respond to the call, from its allies and from within the country\n        as well, for a greater and more responsible role in the world, Japan\n        developed what Ohira Masayoshi, after he became prime minister in\n        December 1978, called a \"comprehensive security and defense\n        strategy to safeguard peace.\" Under this policy, Japan sought to\n        place its relations with the United States on a new footing--one of\n        close cooperation but on a more reciprocal and autonomous basis, and on\n        a global scale. This policy was put to the test in November 1979, when radical\n        Iranians seized the United States embassy in Tehran, taking sixty\n        hostages. Japan reacted by condemning the action as a violation of\n        international law. At the same time, Japanese trading firms and oil\n        companies reportedly purchased Iranian oil that had become available\n        when the United States banned oil imported from Iran. This action\n        brought sharp criticism from the United States of Japanese government\n        \"insensitivity\" for allowing the oil purchases and led to a\n        Japanese apology and agreement to participate in sanctions against Iran\n        in concert with other United States allies. Following that incident, the Japanese government took greater care to\n        support United States international policies designed to preserve\n        stability and promote prosperity. Japan was prompt and effective in\n        announcing and implementing sanctions against the Soviet Union following\n        the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December 1979. In 1981, in\n        response to United States requests, it accepted greater responsibility\n        for defense of seas around Japan, pledged greater support for United\n        States forces in Japan, and persisted with a steady buildup of the SDF. Aqualitatively new stage of Japan-United States cooperation in world\n        affairs appeared to be reached in late 1982 with the election of Prime\n        Minister Nakasone Yasuhiro. Officials of the Ronald Reagan\n        administration worked closely with their Japanese counterparts to\n        develop a personal relationship between the two leaders based on their\n        common security and international outlook. Nakasone reassured United\n        States leaders of Japan's determination against the Soviet threat,\n        closely coordinated policies with the United States toward such Asian\n        trouble spots as the Korean Peninsula and Southeast Asia, and worked\n        cooperatively with the United States in developing China policy. The\n        Japanese government welcomed the increase of United States forces in\n        Japan and the western Pacific, continued the steady buildup of the SDF,\n        and positioned Japan firmly on the side of the United States against the\n        threat of Soviet international expansion. Japan continued to cooperate\n        closely with United States policy in these areas following Nakasone's\n        term of office, although the political leadership scandals in Japan in\n        the late 1980s made it difficult for newly elected President George Bush\n        to establish the same kind of close personal ties that marked the Reagan\n        years. Aspecific example of Japan's close cooperation with the United\n        States included its quick response to the United States call for greater\n        host nation support from Japan following the rapid realignment of\n        Japan-United States currencies in the mid-1980s. The currency\n        realignment resulted in a rapid rise of United States costs in Japan,\n        which the Japanese government, upon United States request, was willing\n        to offset. Another set of examples was provided by Japan's willingness\n        to respond to United States requests for foreign assistance to countries\n        considered of strategic importance to the West. During the 1980s, United\n        States officials voiced appreciation for Japan's \"strategic\n        aid\" to countries such as Pakistan, Turkey, Egypt, and Jamaica.\n        Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki's pledges of support for East European and\n        Middle Eastern countries in 1990 fit the pattern of Japan's willingness\n        to share greater responsibility for world stability. Despite complaints from some Japanese businesses and diplomats, the\n        Japanese government remained in basic agreement with United States\n        policy toward China and Indochina. The government held back from\n        large-scale aid efforts until conditions in China and Indochina were\n        seen as more compatible with Japanese and United States interests. Of\n        course, there also were instances of limited Japanese cooperation.\n        Japan's response to the United States decision to help to protect\n        tankers in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88) was\n        subject to mixed reviews. Some United States officials stressed the\n        positive, noting that Japan was unable to send military forces because\n        of constitutional reasons but compensated by supporting the construction\n        of a navigation system in the Persian Gulf, providing greater host\n        nation support for United States forces in Japan, and providing loans to\n        Oman and Jordan. Japan's refusal to\n        join even in a mine-sweeping effort in the Persian Gulf was an\n        indication to some United States officials of Tokyo's unwillingness to\n        cooperate with the United States in areas of sensitivity to Japanese\n        leaders at home or abroad. The main area of noncooperation with the United States in the 1980s\n        was Japanese resistance to repeated United States efforts to get Japan\n        to open its market more to foreign goods and to change other economic\n        practices seen as adverse to United States economic interests. Acommon\n        pattern was followed. The Japanese government was sensitive to political\n        pressures from important domestic constituencies that would be hurt by\n        greater openness. In general, these constituencies were of two\n        types--those representing inefficient or \"declining\"\n        producers, manufacturers, and distributors, who could not compete if\n        faced with full foreign competition; and those up-and-coming industries\n        that the Japanese government wished to protect from foreign competition\n        until they could compete effectively on world markets. To deal with\n        domestic pressures while trying to avoid a break with the United States,\n        the Japanese government engaged in protracted negotiations. This tactic\n        bought time for declining industries to restructure themselves and new\n        industries to grow stronger. Agreements reached dealt with some aspects\n        of the problems, but it was common for trade or economic issues to be\n        dragged out in talks over several years, involving more than one\n        market-opening agreement. Such agreements were sometimes vague and\n        subject to conflicting interpretations in Japan and the United States. During the 1970s and 1980s, United States administrations had favored\n        an issue-by-issue approach in negotiating such economic disputes with\n        Japan. This approach ostensibly limited the areas of dispute. But it\n        resulted in widespread negative publicity, at a time when changing\n        economic and security circumstances were causing both countries to\n        reevaluate the relationship. Notable outpourings of United States\n        congressional and media rhetoric critical of Japan accompanied the\n        disclosure in 1987 that Toshiba had illegally sold sophisticated\n        machinery of United States origin to the Soviet Union, which reportedly\n        allowed Moscow to make submarines quiet enough to avoid United States\n        detection, and the United States congressional debate in 1989 over the\n        Japan-United States agreement to develop a new fighter aircraft--the\n        FSX--for Japan's Air Self- Defense Force. Anew approach was added in 1989. The so-called Structural\n        Impediments Initiative was a series of talks designed to deal with\n        domestic structural problems limiting trade on both sides. After several\n        rounds of often contentious talks, agreements were reached in April and\n        July 1990 that promised major changes in such sensitive areas as\n        Japanese retailing practices, land use, and investment in public works.\n        The United States pledged to deal more effectively with its budget\n        deficit and to increase domestic savings. United States supporters saw\n        the Structural Impediments Initiative talks as addressing fundamental\n        causes of Japan-United States economic friction. Skeptics pointed to\n        them as ways for officials to buy time and avoid an acute crisis in\n        Japan-United States relations. The Bill Clinton administration decided\n        to end the Structural Impediments Initiative in the summer of 1993 as a\n        framework for dealing with United States-Japan bilateral relations.

Ihave been kindly requested\r\nto write an article about my experience and interest in the IITM Software.\r\nUpon receiving this suggestion Imust confess Imet with two contradictory\r\nfeelings. On the one hand, Iwas pleased and even also somewhat proud;\r\nIfelt glad indeed if Icould in any way bring a contribution to young\r\nIndian students, as being myself a Westerner with a very great moral and\r\nspiritual debt towards Mother India, at least and at last Icould perhaps\r\ndo something useful towards Her and her children. On the other end, Ifelt\r\nsomewhat reluctant because writing such an article meant inevitably speaking\r\nat length about myself, which Ido hate and find utterly repellent. Even\r\nin French we use to say: « le moi est haïssable », i.e.\r\n« The Iis detestable ». And Iwas deeply aware of that long\r\nbefore Iread the famous words from the Bhagavatpaada: manobuddhyaha.nkaarachittaani naahaM. But after pondering carefully over the subject\r\nthe first feeling overcame the second, and here follows my small article\r\n(at least Ishall try to make it short in spite of an inborn tendency to\r\nbe often quite talkative and prone to unending comments). Ishall make\r\nit in three parts: I. My condition as a heavily disabled person II. My interest in the Sanaatana Dharma III. My interest in the IITM software I. My condition as a heavily disabled\r\nperson Iwas fortunate enough not\r\nto be born disabled nor did it happen during my childhood, which thanks\r\nto the Gods was very healthy and happy, apart from the fact that my father\r\ndied when Iwas very young, only just more than 10 year old, which had\r\nvery crucial and long lasting consequences for the rest of my life. Now aged 55, my handicap\r\ncame totally unexpectedly a few days before my 49th birthday in the end\r\nof 1994, when all of a sudden as a result of overwork, strain and stress\r\n(Iwas the Managing Director of a medium-sized company and did not hesitate\r\nduring several years in very difficult business circumstances to work for\r\n14 and to 16 hour a day) Ihad a brain infarct, which resulted in a stroke\r\nof hemiplegia and Iremained paralysed on the left side of my body. In\r\none way, Iwas rather fortunate and blessed by the Gods that, first Idid\r\nnot die on the spot, or during the first three following days, which is\r\noften the case, and second that the accident took place in the right side\r\nof my brain, thus affecting the left side of my body; should had it been\r\nthe reverse, Ishould have lost speech and my hand-writing capability,\r\na full disaster for me who happen to be a right-handed person. After six\r\nmonths of highly dedicated rehabilitation in a physiotherapy clinic, with\r\na lot of will, endurance and determination Icould recover pretty well\r\nbut not enough to be able to take up my old job again. Iwas dismissed\r\nby my company in 1995 and was declared an invalid by the French Social\r\nSecurity. Since then Iam so to say a kind of person in early retirement. Unfortunately in 1995 and\r\n1997 Iexperienced some more health problems in my brain that more or less\r\nruined the good recovery Ihad reached before those complications. In any\r\ncase, Ican walk just a little inside my home with the help of a walking\r\nstick and am not compelled to spend the whole day sitting on my wheelchair.\r\nThe biggest problem for me comes from my left hand that is now virtually\r\ndead. Prior to my accident Iwas very excellent indeed at typing on a keyboard,\r\nhaving learnt at school during my commercial studies, and using professionally\r\nand rapidly all my ten fingers from both hands. Now Ican type with only\r\nthree fingers of my right hand. II. My interest in the Sanaatana Dharma Born in France, (in a family\r\nnative of Alsace near the German border, why my name does not sound typically\r\nFrench, like Dupont or Durand), just after Worl War II, in late November\r\n1945, Ihad always been a very religious boy, but when Ireached 14, Icould no longer remain satisfied with the creeds, beliefs and practices\r\nof the Roman Catholic Church, in which Ihad been being born and educated.\r\nThese did not appear to me « catholic » enough, as this word\r\nshould originally mean « universal ». One day, about November\r\n1960 (i.e. aged more or less exactly 15), while looking at random at books\r\nin a bookshop that Iused to visit quite often (in Paris where Iwas born\r\nand living at that time), Istarted to turn over, just by a stroke of luck,\r\nthe pages of the French translation of « Jñâna Yoga\r\n» of Svâmî Vivekânanda, and was seized with wonder\r\nseeing that the book included two chapters on a universal religion. Ifelt\r\nthis was exactly what Iwas longing for, and Ibought the book immediately\r\nand read it eagerly from cover to cover: Iwas overwhelmed with joy and\r\nwanted to know more. After reading « Jñâna Yoga \r\n» several times, Iwanted to know also about S'rî Râmakrishna.\r\nIstarted to look for further literature on the Paramahamsa, and in a rather\r\nsmall booklet learnt at last that there existed one Râmakrishna Vedânta\r\nCentre in France. Igot the address from the Indian Embassy in Paris. All\r\nthese investigations had of course taken some time, and it was only in\r\nearly May 1961 (it was thus exactly 40 years on the 4th of May 2001), aged\r\n15 year and a half, that Ifirst visited the French Râmakrishna Vedânta\r\nCentre in Gretz.There, Icame fortunately very rapidly into a tight and\r\nfriendly relationship with a brahmâcâri, disciple of the late\r\nSvâmî Siddhes'varânanda, who had founded the Centre in\r\n1937 in Paris, and had then established it in Gretz in 1947. Unfortunately\r\nhe had passed away 4 years earlier, in beginning April 1957 and Icould\r\nnot meet him personally. Svâmî Siddhes'varânanda was\r\nhimself a disciple of Svâmî Brahmânanda, a direct disciple\r\nof S'rî Râmakrishna, appearing often in the so-called «\r\nGospel » (Ido not like the use of this Christian name and prefer\r\nto stick to the original tittle « Kathâmrita »: Svâmî\r\nBrahmânanda was Râkhâl, in the inner circle of young\r\ndisciples, and later he became the President of the Math and Mission).\r\nIbecame fortunately very rapidly an enthusiastic student of the above-mentioned\r\nbrahmâcâri. My main subject of study with my Vedânta\r\nteacher (apart from the teachings of Paramahamsa S'rî Râmakrishna)\r\nwas avasthâtraya vicâra as taught to Svâmî Siddhes'varânanda\r\nby his own teacher in philosophy S'rî V. Subrahmania Iyer, a prominent\r\nphilosopher of the XXth century (reader in Philosophy of the Mahârâja\r\nof Mysore) and himself (S'rî Iyer) a disciple of His Holiness S'rî\r\nSaccidânanda S'ivâbhinava Narasimha Bharatî Mahasvâmî,\r\nJagadguru of S'ringeri from 1878 to 1912. Svâmî Siddhes'varânanda\r\nalways insisted on the fact that exactly as one needs two legs for walking\r\nor two hands for working (Iexperience myself this point every day more\r\npainfully than anybody else), we need, in this age, for our spiritual life\r\nto harmonise the teachings of S'rî Râmakrishna and the pure\r\nVedânta of S'ankara as taught by the above-mentioned Jagadguru of\r\nS'ringeri to S'rî Subrahmania Iyer, and mainly emphasizing avasthâtraya\r\nvicâra, the major and unique contribution of the Indian philosophy\r\nto the universal philosophy, most of the other aspects of the Indian philosophy\r\nor theology having already more or less their equivalent or counterpart\r\nin the Western thought. That is what Idedicated my life to. Apart from a repeated study\r\nof the Bhagavad Gîtâ and of course all major Upanishads Ihad\r\na special interest for the mANDUkyakArikA of GauDaPAda, which deals only\r\nwith the avastha-s. Also, Iread again and again\r\nand studied very carefully, and even translated in parts « VEDÂNTA,\r\nOR THE SCIENCE OF REALITY » of S'rî K.A. Krishnasvami Iyer. Having also studied all\r\nfour volumes of THE CULTURAL HERITAGE OF INDIA, published by the RAMAKRISHNA\r\nINSTITUTE OF CULTURE, Itranslated into French the two articles from volume\r\nIII: THE ESSENTIALS OF VEDANTA by S'rî V.\r\nSubrahmania Iyer and PHILOSOPHY OF ADVAITA by S'rî K.A. Krishnasvami\r\nIyer Ialso translated into French MAN'S INTEREST IN PHILOSOPHY by S'rî\r\nV. Subrahmania Iyer first published in 1936 by Messrs Allen and Unwin in\r\n« CONTEMPORARY INDIAN PHILOSOPHY » edited by S. Radhakrishnan\r\nand J.H. Muirhead in the Muirhead Library of Philosophy and also later\r\nincluded in « THE PHILOSOPHY OF TRUTH OR TATTVAGNANA » a collection\r\nof speeches and writings by Sri V. Subrahmania Iyer edited by Dr T.M.P.\r\nMAHADEVAN, Department of Philosophy, University of Madras, 1955, upon request\r\nof S'rî Iyer's family. But none of these translations\r\nhave been published so far. Ishall hand them to my sons who shall make\r\na good use of it, Ifeel sure. (more in § III.) As my father had passed\r\naway when Iwas only a little more than 10 year old, and that we were not\r\nrich people, Icould not afford long academic studies (quite attracted\r\nby languages, Ishould have felt inclined to study Sanskrit at the University,\r\nalong with Bengali, to be able to read the S'rî Râmakrishna\r\nKathâmrita in the original language, and possibly translate it into\r\nFrench), but instead Ihad to start earning my living just after finishing\r\nmy military training. Thus, slightly over 20 equipped\r\nonly with basic occupational commercial studies acquired before my military\r\ntraining (from 15 to 19), Istarted a nearly 30-year long career with the\r\nSwedish Paper Industry, first as a local salesman, then as the Managing\r\nDirector of 3 different Sales Companies. Instead of Sanskrit and Bengali,\r\nIlearnt Swedish, which Italk and write just about as fluently as French. Although not properly a\r\ntranslator, Ihad to do a lot of translations from Swedish and English\r\ninto French, and hence also devoted much of my vacant time to « translation\r\nstudies » to become as proficient as ever possible on the subject,\r\nwhich also helped me to a large extent for my subsequent Vedantic translations. From 1970 to 1981, then\r\nstill living in Paris, Idelivered 104 lectures, mostly on Indian philosophy\r\nand other aspects of the Sanâtana Dharma. Iam extremely afflicted\r\nnot to have been blessed by the DIVINE MOTHER to reach the sacred number\r\nof 108, but with HER help and blessings Ishall try again to make it in\r\nmy next life! My professional life was\r\nvery successful but in 1994, there were a many problems in my Mother Company\r\nin Sweden, because of mergers. Iwas chosen as the Manager for the new\r\nFrench Sales Company resulting from the merger, but this meant a lot of\r\noverwork and additional strain, which resulted in the stroke of hemiplegia\r\nmentioned in the § I, which left me paralysed on my left side (in\r\nthe beginning of November 1994, 3 weeks exactly before my 49th birthday).\r\nIn my medical ignorance, Ifelt pretty sure that problems with brain arteries\r\nwere always more or less related to cholesterol and arteriosclerosis, and\r\nas Ihad never had any of these, and although a businessman had tried to\r\nhave a very hygienic way of life, Ifelt myself somewhat well protected\r\nor immune against such problems and Idid not hesitate to work more than\r\nIshould have done. Ireally had even become what is termed in the U.S.,\r\nIhave heard, a « workaholic ». It was only in the hospital\r\nthat the doctors explained to me that overwork, overtax and stress may\r\nas well provoke a « brain infarct » as the most commonly known\r\n« heart infarct », all the more as in my case, the «\r\ninfarct » was not a thrombosis (but Ido not want to indulge into\r\ntoo many medical details, out of the subject, and for which Ido not know\r\nall the necessary technical vocabulary in English). Besides, Imay have\r\nbeen suffering, without knowing it, of a kind of hereditary weakness of\r\nthe brain arteries' walls. As already said, prior to\r\nmy stroke, Ihad quite an excellent typing, very rapid too and highly qualified.\r\nBut it's now all gone, my left hand being almost dead, and Itype with\r\nonly one or two fingers of my right hand. This is why my e-mail postings\r\ntake (or at least used to take?) such a long time and are (were?) often\r\nfull of typing errors. Normally, Itry to read\r\nand read again chasing for these typos prior to sending e-mails. But first,\r\nthere are always some typos that escape and second, it always gives me\r\nthe occasion for a further digression, as new ideas are coming while reading\r\nand my messages, letters or texts use to become longer and longer with\r\nevery attempt to get rid of typing errors. But in March 2001 Ibought\r\na new computer and at the same time Iinvested in a speech recognition\r\nsoftware, which works in French as well as in English and with the help\r\nof which Ican now dictate my correspondence in both languages, as well\r\nas do my captivating translation work. The system runs very well and it\r\nis indeed one of the very good achievements of the information technology.\r\nAnd as a consequence, Ido hope that a part of the above problems with\r\ntypos will be eradicated in the future. Moreover, instead of typing\r\nIcan now dictate my translations or the articles Iintend to write, which\r\nis quite comfortable. Now if the voice recognition software normally does\r\nnot make typos, it only recognises the sounds that reach the microphone\r\nand not the words nor their meaning; the machine does not understand you\r\nbut only transfers on the screen the sounds it has received, including\r\nnoises from the environment, which sometimes results in other types of\r\nerrors very often quite unexpected and sometimes jocular. But this is quite\r\nanother story. Anyway this digression leads me smoothly to the third part\r\nof my article. III. My interest in the IITM software : As soon as it became obvious\r\nto me that my professional life was over and that in this respect Ihad\r\nbecome socially an invalid or an early retired person, Idecided to devote\r\nall my time and efforts to the topics that had been in the centre of all\r\nmy life (even if at times in the background because of my job) Sanskrit\r\nand Vedânta. If Ihad started to learn\r\nsome Sanskrit already when Iwas 15, as a fact Inever went farther than\r\nsome rudiments or basics and always remained a kind of eternal beginner.\r\nTo be frank Ihad strictly no interest in learning such enlightening phrases\r\nlike \"Râma sees the two elephants\". What Iwanted was to be able\r\nto translate very accurately the few verses from the Bhagavad Gîtâ\r\nor the texts from S'rî S'ankarâcarya that Iwas quoting and\r\ncommenting in my own lectures. Thus Idecided to start\r\nafresh my studies of the Sanskrit language in a very serious way this time;\r\nand with the development of the information technology and the Internet,\r\nthere now exists very fascinating and facilitative possibilities that did\r\nnot exist when Iwas only 15. Moreover Ihave not the\r\npretence, ambition nor conceitedness to write my Complete Works. But when\r\npreparing the already mentioned 104 lectures that Idelivered in Paris,\r\nIhave accumulated such a huge documentation that Ihave a lot of material\r\navailable for writing articles on several aspects of the Sanâtana\r\nDharma and quite especially on Vedânta and my favourite subject viz\r\navasthâtraya vicâra. Married in 1974, my wife\r\nand Ihave two sons now aged 25 and 23 who are studying and preparing themselves\r\nfor the highest posts in the University. The eldest one is studying History\r\nand the youngest one Philosophy. When they have finished their studies,\r\nif my health is still permitting, and with the blessings of the DIVINE\r\nMOTHER, we intend to write all three of us a book on \"some aspects of Vedânta\r\nin the XXth-century\". In the meantime as they have of course quite a lot\r\nof other subjects to prioritise, Ihave started writing some articles based\r\non the archives Ihave available here. And this is where the IITM software\r\nis proving extremely useful to me. Although Itry not to overdo it with\r\nthem, those articles (or a few other translations Iam continuing to do\r\non the subject and some of which might have their place in the main dissertation)\r\noften include quotations or footnotes with Sanskrit words or sloka-s.\r\nIt is obvious that most Westerners cannot the Sanskrit language, but Iprefer in any case to supply the Sanskrit text for some translated sloka-s\r\nso that the readers can at least recognise the words. This being the case,\r\nit is of utmost importance to cite the aforesaid quotations in diacriticised\r\nRoman transliteration. But Ihave decided as a personal discipline as a\r\nwell as an introduction to the Sanskrit language for my sons to show the\r\ntext also in devanâgarî. And in this respect the IITM software\r\nis really unparalleled. Of course in the beginning things were not very\r\neasy for me, all the more as -as far as computers are concerned- Iam only\r\nan average user and not at all a specialist of the information technology.\r\nBut Dr R. Kalyanakrishnan spared no effort to help me and to facilitate\r\nthings for me (even at the expense of explaining very basic details that\r\nIshould have known, or reminding me some other ones Ihad known (when\r\nstarting the computerisation of my firm) but had later forgotten), and\r\nIreally feel very indebted and grateful to him for all what he has done\r\nin this respect. Icame into contact with\r\nDr Kalyanakrishnan upon suggestion of S'rî N. Krishnaswamy of Vidya\r\nVrikshah whom Ihad got in touch with as to a translation of the maaNDuukyakarikaa,\r\nwhich is as the reader will have understood of the highest importance for\r\nme. Thus the parts of the IITM\r\nsoftware that are of special and main interest to me are the ones that\r\nrefer to Sanskrit and I.P.A. transliteration. The transliteration into\r\nother Indian languages is less primary to me although useful at times for\r\nother purposes. As a fact Ihave some Hindu friends in what was until recently\r\nWest Bengal, in Kerala and also in Karnataka, and when writing to them\r\nby now Ialways try to write their first names in their own languages,\r\nBangla, Kannada or Malayâlam. This is only a small sign of friendship:\r\nthey know Icannot their language and do not intend to learn it either.\r\nBut Ishall never speak Sanskrit with anybody either at least in this life!\r\nMy purpose is not to be able to buy milk in Sanskrit (as the CD-ROMs released\r\nlast year by Samskrita Bhârati would like me to be able to do). My\r\nvery limited and egoistic aim is nothing but to try to read, understand\r\ncorrectly and if possible translate accurately into French just a few jewels\r\nof the Scriptures, of S'rî S'a.nkara's bhâshya-s and of the\r\nKârikâ-s. Should Isucceed in doing that, it should actually\r\nbe quite enough for this life.· mailto:guy.werlings@wanadoo.fr RETURN TO PREVIOUS\r\nPAGE"}]}

In my defence, Ican only point to a constitutional inablility to resist commenting on the mistakes, inaccuracy and poor writing that Isee almost daily in the press. Take the work of Rowan Pelling , for example. She's apparently quite well known over here, though Ihad never heard of her until Irecently started reading the Independent (because I'm lazy, and there's so much easy grist in its pages). Since I've first become aware of her - through noting with amusement her ignorant misuse of the word \"gainsay\" - I've learned that she is in fact past editor of something called the Erotic Review , which purports to bring erotic writing to the intelligentsia. More recently, she's been pressed into service as a judge of the prestigious Booker Prize for literature, as she repeatedly reminded us this summer. Incidentally, the first of those last three links is almost worth the £1 it costs to access. In it, Pelling complains of suffering from \" judges' tristesse\" - a depression, tinged with guilt, that afflicts literary prize givers after they make an award. In Rowan's case, the tristesse was particularly bad, since she was the very, very most important judge of all - the \"Florida\" of judges, as she put it (referring to that state's role in the 2000 US elections). Iadmit to wondering what she was going to write about once the Booker had been awarded, given the frequency with which she addressed that topic (and, more importantly, her role as judge). In fact, Iwas afraid that the tristesse would weigh so heavily upon her that she'd be forced to give up writing entirely. Thankfully Ineedn't have worried - she reappears in the pages of yesterday's Evening Standard , having secured a job reviewing Love for Sale: A Global History of Prostitution . The post-Booker Pelling has lost none of her punch, and she mercilessly hits the reader with one shot after another. Wasting no time, she lets us have it right from the opening bell, with a couple of glancing jabs: \" Legend has it that the Innuits have several hundred words for snow .\" Since she at least says \" legend has it ,\" the opening combination isn't terribly  painful - though including as it does the jarring variant spelling  \" Innuits, \" it does impart a bit of a sting. But the opening jabs soften us up for this: \"In the Hindu kingdoms of India in the last centuries BC, there were more than 300 different Sanskrit words for prostitute. Isuppose that amply illustrates the cultural differences between people of hot and cold climes.\" Of course, it illustrates exactly nothing at all, not least because the first half of the comparison is so completely spurious . Nils Ringal , author of the book being reviewed, will no doubt be irritated that his factual nugget is sullied by the juxtaposition with one that's been so frequently debunked. Second paragraph. The hapless reader is hit with: \"Ringal's comprehensive study of turning tricks is equally compelling in its broader picture, whisking the reader from the temple prostitutes of Mesopotamia to the New York Mayfair Madam ...\" Who is this 'Mayfair Madam', one wonders? Ms. Pelling, like her headline writer, seems to think that we'll all get the reference, but I've never heard of her. Either Idon't know enough about prostitutes, or Rowan is inaccurately referring to the Mayflower Madam , who was all over the New York papers in the mid-80s. Although it's distressing to imagine the former Erotic Review editor making such an error, it is again no knockout punch in and of itself - but we're feeling just a tad woozy so early into the column. Third paragraph: \"He points out that Polynesian women, for example, have almost no concept of selling their favours when they can bestow them freely where they please and without censor.\" Censor/censure ! Ouch - that one hurts! It might draw only a wince if seen in a freshman essay, but from the \"Florida of the Booker Prize\" it draws blood - the reader, still reeling from the jabs just thrown, staggers. Staggers, but carries gamely on - to the next paragraph: \"Prostitutes enjoyed some form of legislative protection and paid taxes in civilisations ranging from  Chandragupta's Indian empire of 4BC ...\" Or maybe it was the 4th century BC. But what difference does it make? The fight is lost - after four such shots in four paragraphs, the reader is well and truly on the ropes, with no choice but to assume a defensive posture - dreading the next error (logical, linguistic or factual), and doubting every single assertion that Ms. Pelling makes.

David Kerr"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The increasing complexity of today's healthcare equipment procurement environment has presented some new challenges for medical device manufacturing companies and their sales representatives. To gain a competitive edge in influencing product selection may require struggle. The emergence of intricate purchasing plans, contract-buying trends, and shifting pricing options constitute one set of challenges. Another relates to the growing complexity of medical technology itself, particularly its incorporation of information technology (IT) capabilities. Medical device manufacturers and their field reps are discovering several healthcare industry procurement hurdles that need to be overcome. Group purchasing organizations (GPOs), contractual buying arrangements, on-line ordering, and face-to-face selling are each scenarios that present a distinct challenge for pricing and relationship building. Atool that can be of value in each of these situations is mobile sales force automation (SFA) technology. Face-to-face selling is made easier by the development of personal relationships with physicians and surgeons in situations where they play an important role in purchasing. When doctors demand considerable technical data, product training, and manufacturer support, those sales reps armed with real-time data and interactive presentation tools will be the ones most likely to close a sale. In an effort to foster better relationships with, and provide more value to, physicians—and to the healthcare industry generally—some medtech companies are investing in integrated sales, marketing, and supply-chain management systems that are known as customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Mobile SFA is a primary tool driving this initiative to meet, on demand and in the field, ever-growing customer needs (see sidebar). According to a recent report by  market analysts Frost & Sullivan (San Antonio, TX), CRM license revenue from mobile SFA applications, for both wired and wireless devices, is expected to grow from a predicted $169 million in 2004 to $293 million by 2008. The fastest-growing segment, wireless SFA, is projected to grow from $20 million to $115 million over that period. 1 This article examines ways that mobile SFA can make medtech companies' field-based sales forces more effective in a procurement environment trending toward consolidated purchasing and automatic ordering while also serving the interests of institutional purchasers. Sales Approaches by Product Category Three major categories of medical devices—disposable goods, high-margin devices, and capital goods—call for different sales approaches. Handheld sales technology plays a different role in each. In the hospital environment, purchasing departments and GPOs tend to control vendor selection, product pricing, and the awarding of contracts. This holds true especially with commodity-based products such as disposables (surgical gloves, swabs, and so on) where price is the primary differentiator and organizations are reordering more often than making first-time purchases. Rather than buying directly from a sales rep, these purchasing groups use electronic purchasing technology such as electronic data interchange (EDI) to maximize ordering efficiency and optimize savings. Since the decisionmaking process and the sales cycle for disposable products are both very short, new purchasing and inventory replenishment tend to be conducted on-line. Here, manufacturers need to distinguish their products from competitors' while offering the lowest price and an efficient ordering process. Despite stringent pricing constraints prevalent in this category, sales reps with real-time mobile access to pricing models, product specifications, inventory information, and delivery schedules during the sales call gain advantage for their employers in terms of better CRM functionality, more-efficient document management, and electronic order submission and tracking. Mobile technology gives reps the ability to capture, store, and view account history during the sales call, and to present new products immediately at launch. At the other end of the medical device spectrum are capital goods—heavy, expensive, highly sophisticated medical equipment. In this complex segment, product lines are narrow, sales cycles are very long, and purchasing decisions are made by committee."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mobile SFA tools enable sales reps to access detailed technical information about their companies' products. (click to enlarge)"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Reps typically do not stock such inventory in the field, nor can they demonstrate equipment for each prospect. What is imperative for them is keeping a variety of technical specifications and a detailed account history on hand. They can, of course, benefit from mobile SFA functions that aid in selling, such as interactive presentations, video product demonstrations, side-by-side product comparisons, and display of technical documentation and complex pricing configurations. But the handheld technology enables them also to review and update the account history, check the field service and equipment maintenance history, and manage customer contact information relating to every member of the committee. Selling Complex, High-Margin Devices In between commodity disposables and capital goods falls the realm of high-margin implantable and diagnostic medical devices. These electromedical products have become increasingly sophisticated as they have incorporated miniaturized electronics and then embedded microprocessors. New IT-based devices in this category now contribute heavily to the ability of physicians to make reliable therapeutic decisions by means of the vital data they gather and record. Owing to the complexity of these products, the surgeon or physician who uses them typically makes or strongly influences the purchasing decision. New product sales (rather than repeat sales) are common in this category because physicians focus on meeting the requirements of individual patients. GPOs are more price driven, but physicians purchasing highly complex devices base their decisions on specific patient needs, insurance reimbursements, product performance, and manufacturer support. In this situation, a close, trusting relationship between sales rep and physician is critical. Physicians need to be confident of the rep's recommendations, the product's reliability, and the manufacturer's training support. Mobile SFA tools in the hands of sales reps enable device manufacturers to satisfy these buying criteria. They can help physicians make an educated decision by providing: Details of product features, specifications, and benefits. Critical data regarding product reliability and accuracy, such as clinical trial results. Side-by-side comparisons of competitive products. Interactive presentations and video surgical demonstrations. Downloadable educational material from the manufacturer. Reimbursement guidelines. The mobile technology provides efficiency benefits for the wider institutional healthcare system as well (see sidebar). Mobile SFA technology facilitates relationship building by providing sales reps with all the information and resources they need at the point of purchase, which might be the physician's office, operating room, or surgeon's lounge. Physicians are often challenged to sift through and process a great deal of technical and clinical information in order to make qualified decisions. Real-time access to corporate systems via mobile technology enables the sales rep to anticipate and respond quickly to technical questions about product performance and customization options, as well as refute competitive claims, track inventory, and fulfill orders on the spot. Well-prepared, well-educated reps armed with a complete set of easily accessible resources during the sales call are likely to be considered more credible by physicians and surgeons than those who are not. In addition, SFA technology gives sales reps the tools for introducing new products to customers sooner than traditional methods would allow. They can make a professional and information-rich presentation to educate physicians about each new device immediately upon rollout. Collateral Benefits Mobile technology empowers sales reps and makes them more efficient (see sidebar). But by implementing handheld SFA solutions the medical device manufacturing companies that employ them gain in other ways. These benefits include CRM economy, easy field deployment, greater sales force productivity, and enhanced supply-chain visibility. Alternative to Traditional CRM. Integrated CRM systems are no longer restricted by high cost to enterprises with large sales teams. Advances in system security and data integrity protocols allow companies of all sizes to outsource the SFA function of their CRM system with confidence. Also, the evolution of the application service provider (ASP) model—a hosted, pay-as-you-go arrangement—makes customized sales solutions affordable for smaller organizations. Depending on the functionality and support level required, the cost per user of hosted SFA services is comparable to that of telephone service. Ease of Deployment. Smaller medical device companies with fewer than 50 sales reps can field-deploy such new technologies as mobile SFA quite rapidly. For reasons of economy, they tend to favor subscription-based services, which can be implemented immediately and independently of legacy systems. And because the IT resources they employ are generally not very extensive, requirements for customization and integration into back-office systems are very manageable. Larger organizations—those with, say, 500 reps or more—may require more time to deploy SFA technology effectively because of the need to take into account highly complex legacy systems when implementing integrated field solutions. Also, decisionmaking is naturally a slower process, and large internal IT departments have to take time to learn the new technologies before they are prepared to support the mobile sales force. An SFA pilot program involving the rollout of one business unit at a time is one way for a larger enterprise to accelerate deployment."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Sales Staff Productivity. Such administrative tasks as handling order paperwork and entering call notes for management review can occupy a substantial portion of a sales rep's workday. Medtech organizations seeking ways to minimize these burdens so reps can focus on revenue-generating activities such as prospecting, physician visits, and relationship building may find mobile SFA technology helpful in this regard. Asecondary benefit is a clearer window into sales activities. Supply Chain Visibility. Most supply chain technology is focused on the movement and storage of assets in the back office. By contrast, mobile SFA illuminates every facet of the dynamic supply chain: in the warehouse, on order, and in the field. This approach to supply-chain tracking—which makes trunk inventory, consignment inventory, expired products, and rep-to-rep inventory transfers completely visible—enables medtech organizations to be more responsive to customers' needs and to be more accountable for their own assets in this era of Sarbanes-Oxley. With their sales reps using handheld tracking technology to report on the movement of their personal inventory in the field, corporations can maintain accurate supply-chain data in real time. Conclusion Mobile SFA technology promotes streamlined management of the technical and administrative aspects of medical technology sales and provides an attractive vehicle for delivering presentations. Medical device sales reps can use the technology to personalize and automate the sales process for enhanced effectiveness in a progressively competitive market. No matter how complex the environment, the reps have the flexibility to close the sale. Relationship- and education-driven sales and those for which profitability depends on efficient, automated ordering are the two poles of modern healthcare equipment procurement. In each scenario, SFA technology arms field reps with detailed, real-time data to satisfy the buyer and organizational tools to function effectively throughout the entire sales process and deliver the competitive edge their employers seek.

Additionally, the impact of having OVTA monitoring and tracking the performance of your application is very low. At a high level, the product provides sufficient data to monitor the application with negligible overhead. You can also tune the amount of trace information captured when performing diagnostics. And even then, the overhead can be controlled to stay at very acceptable ranges while the problem is assessed. OVTA offers broad platform and application support, supporting HP-UX, Solaris, Windows, and Linux, and is capable of supporting both J2EE and .NET platforms. The product is optimized to support the WebLogic platform.  Additionally, the product leverages JMX technology to monitor and assess the overall health of the WebLogic server.

Today, operations relies on the developer because the information available to them is not sufficient to handle the problem themselves. If you can make your applications more \"management aware\", you can hopefully minimize the demands IT support places on you. Additionally, designing applications with \"management in mind\" has some clear benefits to your organization. With the right set of management interfaces exposed by an application, and operator can ensure a higher degree of application availability.  Manageable application can also be made more flexible and adaptive in production. What can you do to make applications more manageable? The good news is that many application platforms today provide some amount management out-of-the-box. Almost all J2EE platforms, including WebLogic, expose management interfaces for the platform in the form of JMX MBeans. These interfaces can then leveraged by management systems such as HP OpenView. In some cases, platform-level management is not sufficient to effectively manage an application in production.

And the beauty of it is that they can use that loudmouthed cretin John Bolton to do it: John R. Bolton flew to Europe in 2002 to confront the head of a global arms-control agency and demand he resign, then orchestrated the firing of the unwilling diplomat in a move a U.N. tribunal has since judged unlawful, according to officials involved. Aformer Bolton deputy says the U.S. undersecretary of state felt Jose Bustani \"had to go,\" particularly because the Brazilian was trying to send chemical weapons inspectors to Baghdad. That might have helped defuse the crisis over alleged Iraqi weapons and undermined a U.S. rationale for war. [...] The Iraq connection to the OPCW affair comes as fresh evidence surfaces that the Bush administration was intent from early on to pursue military and not diplomatic action against Saddam Hussein's regime. An official British document, disclosed last month, said Prime Minister Tony Blair agreed in April 2002 to join in an eventual U.S. attack on Iraq. Two weeks later, Bustani was ousted, with British help. [...] After U.N. arms inspectors had withdrawn from Iraq in 1998 in a dispute with the Baghdad government, Bustani stepped up his initiative, seeking to bring Iraq - and other Arab states - into the chemical weapons treaty. Bustani's inspectors would have found nothing, because Iraq's chemical weapons were destroyed in the early 1990s. That would have undercut the U.S. rationale for war because the Bush administration by early 2002 was claiming, without hard evidence, that Baghdad still had such an arms program. In a March 2002 \"white paper,\" Bolton's office said Bustani was seeking an \"inappropriate role\" in Iraq, and the matter should be left to the U.N. Security Council - where Washington has a veto. Bolton said in a 2003 AP interview that Iraq was \"completely irrelevant\" to Bustani's responsibilities. Earle and Bohlen disagree. Enlisting new treaty members was part of the OPCW chief's job, they said, although they thought he should have consulted with Washington. Former Bustani aide Bob Rigg, a New Zealander, sees a clear U.S. motivation: \"Why did they not want OPCW involved in Iraq? They felt they couldn't rely on OPCW to come up with the findings the U.S. wanted.\" Bustani and his aides believe friction with Washington over OPCW inspections of U.S. chemical-industry sites also contributed to the showdown, which went on for months. The article discusses at some length what an asshole Bolton was, menacing and inapprorpiate, but then what else is new.  What is interesting is that the article connects the dots between Downing St and this explicitly. This is an AP article.  Unfortunately, it is also on the wires on Saturday where it is most likely to be overlooked. Unless we refuse to let it. The media needs a hook to start talking about Downing St. Ithink Bolton's toast, but if the nomination goes forward Iwould certainly hope that the Democrats would use this as an opening to start talking about it.  If Bolton ends up withdrawing because of this (and he might) then the media also has an excuse to talk about it. Iwonder if Monsignor Russert will see fit to discuss this between Hail Mary's on Press the Meat tomorrow morning?

What is really interesting is that the government argued that releasing them would be contrary to the Geneva Conventions. (Via Talk Left ) \"It is indeed ironic that the government invoked the Geneva Conventions as a basis for withholding these photographs,\" said Amrit Singh, a staff attorney at the ACLU. \"Had the government genuinely adhered to its obligations under these Conventions, it could have prevented the widespread abuse of detainees held in its custody in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay.\" It's nearly impossible to be as obtuse as is the Bush administration without having either some sort of cognitive problem or psychological impairment. Isuspect it's the latter. This recent phony outrage about Amnesty International is another example of this pathology. They had no problem using Amnesty to buttress their case against Saddam, but balk at being called to task for our own very obvious and well known human rights abuses in Guantanamo. Of course, there is little mention of this (except by Jon Stewart) so it doesn't matter. Patriotic correctness requires that any criticism of the United States be immediately struck down as treasonous, if not blasphemous.

Matt Yglesias, blogging from his fancy new digs at the TPM Cafe , says today: At today's Take Back America conference Isaw some interesting polling data from Diane Feldman on a subject I'd pondered now and again. Unfortunately, the written summary of the presentation doesn't contain the exact numbers and Ididn't write them down because Iassumed this question would be included in the summary. The point, however, was that when you ask if America is \"the greatest country in the world\" most voters say that it is. When you ask if Democrats believe that America is the greatest country, most voters say that they do not. Ithink it's clear that this perception creates some electoral problems. Indeed, it's a particularly serious kind of electoral problem because my guess is that the perception is probably correct. It seems to me that if you are a member of the \"reality based\" community, as so many of us liberals claim to be, that you can't answer such a question without qualifiers. This means that we are unable to respond in appropriate knee jerk fashion and are therefore assumed to be unpatriotic.  The question is simple minded and it demands a simple minded answer and that's a problem for us.  Perhaps we should just lie, like everyone already does about going to church or whether they are faithful or all the other things Americans are forced to lie about in our right wing PC times. Patriotism is defined in the dictionary quite simply as \"love of one's country and a willingness to sacrifice for it.\"  That is not the same thing as believing that your country is the greatest country in the world. Ilove many things in life that aren't \"the greatest\" and Idon't see the conflict.  One doesn't have to abandon all intellectual integrity to love something, imperfect and not-so-great as it may be. America is certainly the most powerful country in the world. One would think that people could be satisfied enough with that, but apparently not. What does it mean to be the \"greatest country in the world, or as I've heard it put, \"the greatest country the world has ever known\" anyway? Is it measured by how fair and just our system of government is or standard of living or military prowess, or what? Is it, as George W. Bush pushes incessantly, because its people are \"good?\" Or is it that by all measures of all things it is simply the best? Iraise this because Isuspect that what people really want from liberals is not patriotism, but chauvinism, one important facet of which is characterized in this context by the belief that your national culture and interests are superior to any other. (Our vaunted \"exceptionalism\" is not made up of a whole lot more than that simple definition.) And, yes, some liberals do not sign on to that, for good reason.  Because it's bullshit. And America, the home of mutts from all over the world, the give-me-your-tired-your-poor immigrant nation, should be more aware of the shallowness and idiocy of this than any other country in the world. It's not as if we are Germans trying to preserve the fairy tale of a thousand year Reich.  It's one of the good things about not being European, with all that baggage --- or would be if we thought about it for half a minute. Simple observation of the world shows that all nations are made up of human beings, which automatically taints the project.  America and Iraq and China and everywhere else are comprised of this very flawed species. If you live long enough you see that, as much as our fearless leader likes to claim otherwise, Americans are not \"better\" and therefore our country is not \"better.\" Only individual people can be judged better or worse and it is without regard to nationality, culture or religious belief. Our democratic experiment has been a worldwide inspiration and our Bill of Rights is one of the most important contributions any nation has made to mankind. This country has welcomed immigrants (in fits and starts) from all over the world and created a wealthy, successful nation because of it. Iwould easily sacrifice for the country, it's my home. Ilove it the way anyone loves their home, with a deep and emotional connection that transcends intellectual thought.  But Idon't need to suspend my judgement or my faculties and further say that this country is the greatest country on earth. There is no such thing as the greatest country on earth. Matt feels that this presents an electoral problem. Iwould agree if people like me were expressing these views in a political campaign. (Just call me Ward Churchill, Iguess.)  However, the perception that Matt talks about isn't fueled by some quasi intellectual argument about chauvinism.  It's fueled by Rush Limbaugh and his band of flaming gasbags who have spent the last fifteen years saying that liberals hate America day after day. John Kerry volunteered for Vietnam, fought bravely, and came home and devoted himself to ending what he saw as an unjust war. Meanwhile his rival George Bush spent the war drinking beer and fucking off. Yet Kerry was made out to be a coward and Bush a hero. Isuspect that my candidate, Wes Clark, would have been similarly reduced to sissy status despite the fact he was a four star general.  Proof of love and devotion to country is not particularly relevant --- just as what liberals really think about America is not particularly relevant. Our political problems stem from some very deep and ongoing cultural anxieties that we need to think about and confront. What we can't do anything about is the idea that liberals tend to be more --- dare Isay it --- nuanced than conservatives.  It is a characteristic not a policy.   We're stuck with that and we're just going to have to find a way to make it work for us. . digby 6/03/2005 08:26:00 AM |"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Common Sense Dear FEC, Iwrite to you today to request your kind advisory as to whether this pamphlet defines  me as an ACTIVIST or a JOURNALIST.

It turns out that there is a movement afoot to gain some attention for this thing and Ithink it's worth doing, if only for history's sake if nothing else.  There should be a record of some Americans' interest in such a damning document that proves the president of the United States knowingly took the country to war on false pretenses. It may come in handy someday. Shakespeare's Sister informs me that the Big Brass Alliance is a collection of bloggers who are supporting a group called After Downing Street that is dedicated to gaining exposure for this issue.  One positive thing that anyone can do is sign (along with 88 members of congress) this letter that John Conyers has written to the president requesting some answers to the obvious questions this document raises. This isn't some pie-in-the-sky lefty kumbaya petition (not that there's anything wrong with that.)  This memo is smoking gun proof that Bush lied us into war. Many of us knew this from the get. But, Ithink it's probably true that most others already know this on some level as well --- a fair number are glad he did, a few more don't care, and the rest just don't want to confront their own bloodlust or willfull blindness.  It's hard to admit you were wrong about something so deadly. The rest of us need to keep a clear head and insist that this not be swept under the rug to the extent that we can. We have to keep the idea that there will be some sort of rational accountability for such acts alive in this culture or we are goners. . digby 6/02/2005 09:41:00 AM | Losing Their Religion Regarding right wing Christians putting their embryos up for adoption and insisting they not be adopted by gays or non-Christians (preferably not a working woman either) AMERICAblog wonders how this Bush promoted religious discrimination can get past the editors of the NY Times unaddressed. I'll tell you how: Though we have our lapses, (pdf) individual news stories on emotional topics like abortion, gun control, the death penalty and gay marriage are reported and edited with great care, to avoid any impression of bias. Nonetheless, when numerous articles use the same assumption as a point of departure, that monotone can leave the false impression that the paper has chosen sides. This is especially so when we add in our feature sections, whose mission it is to write about novelty in life. As a result, despite the strict divide between editorial pages and news pages, The Times can come across as an advocate. The public editor found that the overall tone of our coverage of gay marriage, as one example, approaches cheerleading. By consistently framing the issue as a civil rights matter -- gays fighting for the right to be treated like everyone else -- we failed to convey how disturbing the issue is in many corners of American social, cultural and religious life. [...] Too often we label whole groups from a perspective that uncritically accepts a stereotype or unfairly marginalizes them. As one reporter put it, words like moderate or centrist inevitably incorporate a judgment about which views are sensible and which are extreme. We often apply religious fundamentalists, another loaded term, to political activists who would describe themselves as Christian conservatives. ... The editors didn't fail.  They succeeded.  They \"re-framed\" the issue of religious discrimination and gay rights. They are simply being \"sensitive\" and \"conveying how disturbing the issue us in many corners of American social, cultural and religious life\" when they uncritically report on a White House endorsed publicly funded group that enables Christian bigots to discriminate even though it's clearly against the law. Ithink it's time we called out the PC police on the wingnuts.  Nobody likes political correctness, not even liberals, really. And our day is long past.  This is the new province of the right and they have finally hammered the press into thinking that discrimination and bigotry are really just normal expressions of religious belief and must be treated with kid gloves. Icall bullshit every time one of these timorous cowards clutch their tiny lace hankies and blubber something about how they are being sensitive to the beliefs of bigoted assholes. Just in case James Dobson and his new friends, the intellectuals at the NY Times, have forgotten their eighth grade American history class, Confederates used the Bible to justify slavery, too. Bin Laden uses the Koran to justify terrorism.  Just because they wrap themselves in the Holy Books doesn't mean these theo-fascists they aren't breaking the laws of both God and Man.

It's only 8 bucks and Iguarantee that it will be worth reading even if you don't agree with his conclusions: Amajority of Americans tell pollsters they want more government intervention to reduce the gap between high- and lower-income citizens, and less than one-third consider high taxes to be a problem.

I'm not shocked by \"The Feminine Mystique\" or even the inclusion of John Maynard Keynes (although you have to love this commentary: \"FDR adopted the idea as U.S. policy, and the U.S. government now has a $2.6-trillion annual budget and an $8-trillion dollar debt.\" Haha.)

And, Isuspect that this is why establishment journos like Daniel Okrent don't  like him.  He just refuses to play the game by establishment rules. This post by Brad DeLong exposes the entire silly social aspect of this and gives us a window into why liberals are being marginalized in the mainstream media. We are supposed to be nice. The other side is expected to be tough and uncompromising.  Krugman is a fighter and he never gives ground when he thinks he's right.  That's unbecoming in a liberal because it means that you have to engage in the facts and have a real argument instead of just hurling insults or bumper stickers as you can when dealing with right wing critics. Daniel Okrent finds his behavior unseemly and annoying: For a man who makes his living offering strong opinions, Paul Krugman seems peculiarly reluctant to grant the same privilege to others. And for a man who leads with his chin twice a week, he acts awfully surprised when someone takes a pop at it [...] On Prof. Krugman's defense of his unfamiliarity with it, he's effectively saying, \"If Ididn't know about it, it must not be important.\" This is a polemicist's dodge; no self-respecting journalist would ever make such an argument. [...] Believe me -- Icould go on, as could a number of readers more sophisticated about economic matters than Iam. (Among these are several who, like me, generally align themselves politically with Prof. Krugman, but feel he does himself and his cause no good when he heeds the roaring approval of his acolytes and dismisses his critics as ideologically motivated.) But Idon't want to engage in an extended debate any more than Prof. Krugman says he does. If he replies to this statement, as Iimagine he will, I'll let him have what he always insists on keeping for himself: the last word. Ihate to do this to a decent man like my successor, Barney Calame, but I'm hereby turning the Krugman beat over to him. Oh Boo hoo hoo.  God forbid a liberal should accuse one's critics of being ideologically motivated. You would think that the ombudsman of the NY Times would have a slightly bigger bone to pick with the right wing which has been calling them ideologically motivated for 40 fucking years. But then, that would require they acknowledge reality and that is what cannot happen. Paul Krugman is an in-your-face, unapologetic member of the reality based community. He calls it as he sees it and he doesn't mince words in doing so. As he amply demonstrated in his response to Okrent's shallow criticisms (which, even if true, would hardly back-up his calumnous accusations in his last piece) Krugman does not particularly enjoy being told he is wrong on the facts when he isn't.  World class economists may be used to being called to task for their conclusions or their predictions, but saying that he is cooking the numbers for partisan reasons are fighting words.  His reputation rests on his intellectual integrity. Of course he is going to fight when challenged by lame conventional wisdom and spoonfed propaganda.  If only more liberal pundits had his guts we might not be where we are today. Paul Krugman is tough and fearless and we need more like him -- people who are not part of the cliquish Sally Quinn social scene (it about made me puke to read that unctuous little screed again) and who do not depend upon the approbation of aging social mavens for their self esteem. Tell me that the party of Krugman is a bunch of soft cowards who can't fight terrorism or run a disciplined economic agenda.  Tell me the party of Krugman doesn't know what it believes in.  The party of Krugman believes in reality, that the emperor has no clothes, that up is up and down is down.  And it isn't afraid to tell snivelling little babies like Daniel Okrent to stick it where the sun don't shine. The party of Krugman doesn't lay down and take it. It fights. Update!

Can you believe it? And then Fox goes on to wonder why that might be.  They simply can't figure it out. They interview people and ponder the question and go to great lengths to explain why it isn't being reported.  Idon't see that they interview Roger Ailes or John Moody, however.  Perhaps they were too busy. They even point out that the left has been trying in vain to get attention for the issue: Several popular left-leaning blogs have taken up the cause to keep the story alive, encouraging readers to contact media outlets. A Web site, DowningStreetMemo.com, tells readers to contact the White House directly with complaints. \"This is a test of the left-wing blogosphere,\" said Jim Pinkerton, syndicated columnist and regular contributor to FOX News Watch, who pointed out that The Sunday Times article came out just before the British election and apparently had little effect on voters' decisions. \"In many ways that memo might prove all of the arguments the critics of the war have made,\" he added. \"But the bulk of Americans don't agree, or don't seem that alarmed, so it is a power test to see if they can drive it back on the agenda.\" Iguess the fact that most people don't know is irelevant. Certainly, it can't be because FoxNews itself isn't reporting it. Except, of course, to report that nobody cares. Even though Pinkerton is trying to turn this into a test of the liberal blogosphere for gawd knows what reason, it is an important story that we should continue to press.

His readers offer some very interesting opinions on the matter, so be sure to read the comment thread if you find this topic intriguing. Ihave a slightly different perception on the matter than most, it seems. Iadmit to having issues with it, probably because Ialways valued time over money. (Of course,  as you get older you begin to realize that you run out of that too.) However, Idon't harbor resentment toward others.  Imade my choices and Idon't live a life full of regret about much of anything.  Ihave no moral qualms about making money (in a decent way) and Idon't think that it's my business to judge others on what they choose to spend it on.  Iappreciate what it can do to make life comfortable for the individual and how it motivates people to work. Icertainly accept that there is something intrinsic to human nature in the acquisition of wealth and the desire to succeed. But Ido have issues, nonetheless. John's readers more than adequately explain what Ithink is the common liberal argument against money and it's the general belief in egalitarianism --- that it is not really moral to have too much when others have so little. These are ideas that, ironically enough, stem from Christian teaching.  So much for the godless heathens of the left. Idon't approach this from a moral standpoint, although I'm sympathetic to the notion just from a human empathetic standpoint.  If you've ever spent much time in the third world, you realize right quick that human life is valued very differently on our planet and it won't make you feel particularly terrific about your own (except, of course, for the South Park Republicans who apparently can't think beyond their good luck --- what they would call their natural superiority --- at being American.) It has been my experience that money confers power over others and that is where Ipersonally get uncomfortable. This is not directly related to marxist theory, although Iwould suspect that there isn't a lefty (or a righty for that matter) who hasn't been influenced to some degree by it, so it's certainly relevant to my thinking on the issue. (He diagnosed the illness, it was his prescription that wasn't so hot.) Mostly,though, Ithink it's a matter of human psychology.  People who work for wages, particularly those lower on the scale, are simply not in control of their lives in the same way as are those who work for themselves or those who are independently wealthy.  From being treated like a lackey by the boss to having to answer to your mother-in-law because she loaned you money for the down payment, there is a slight, and sometimes not so slight, corruption of your freedom every time you are dependent upon another individual's goodwill. And it is a rare person who will not immediately exercise this power over others if they feel threatened or angry and a rare person who will not feel the metaphorical lash at having to answer for it. As much as Iam concerned as they are with individual freedom, this is why Ifind it so hard to relate to libertarians;  Ithink that the common experience of working for wages and being beholden to another individual is more of a tangible infringement upon personal liberty than the extraction of taxes for the greater good. The infringement on personal freedom that is most immediate and constant in most people's lives is having to brownnose another human being or play fast and loose with the rules because their financial survival depends upon it. It's why Isupport unions and workplace rules and consumer rights. In the everyday lives of most people, the biggest limits on their freedom and challenges to their integrity come not from government regulators but greedy and powerful employers. And yet, it is the way of the world and we each have to find a way to live with a modicum of decency and integrity within it.  And Ithink it is a much more complicated and difficult row to hoe than we Americans think it is. It is not as easy to obtain financial freedom as some would have it nor is financial success a perfect illustration of an individual's merit.  That's why Idon't much like money, in a general conceptual way. It has corrupted friendships, family, jobs and relationships in ways that nothing else in my life ever has. It can and is used as a weapon as often as a tool.  In a hyper capitalist society such as ours, it's perhaps the single most powerful method the individual has (or doesn't have) to create his or her own destiny. It's both a blessing and a curse. It's a good thing to think about how you really feel about it --- most Americans never question their assumptions. In many ways, it's probably easier that way.  Bravo to John for bringing it up. And by the way, Ihope this makes it clear that Ido not hold with the idea that because a blogger accepted donations that he or she is required to answer to the donors.  Indeed, Ithink the opposite.  People give money because they appreciate the work.  When they don't appreciate the work they don't give money.  It's one of the cleanest exchanges of goods and services around, fully voluntary and without further obligation on either part. This reminds me of a relative who wanted to help out her grandfather in his later years. He was living with an aunt who also had little money.  This relative agreed to send a hundred dollars a month.  When she went to visit she found out that granddad was drinking a couple of beers every night and the aunt played bingo on Saturdays.  The relative considered these expenses to be a waste. She figured her hundred a month entitled her to straighten up these people's bad habits and she insisted that because she had sent them, by this time, more than a couple thousand dollars that they already owed her quite a lot, even if she withdrew her monthly stipend. They gave up the beer and the bingo but the relative continued to find their spending habits objectionable and made sure that they knew it and did as they were told. Granddad was reduced to sneaking around and the aunt was isolated from all the friends she used to see at weekly bingo. They felt like children. Luckily they both died before long and ended the ritual humiliation the whole thing had evolved into. The money was not worth it. If Aravosis wanted to blow all his donations on lottery tickets they'd be his to blow.  If that bothers you, don't donate again. But making a donation doesn't entitle anyone to think they own John or his blog.  He owns himself, always. . digby 6/01/2005 12:52:00 PM | Maybe He Won't Be Back Check out this fascinating pictorial deconstruction of Schwarzeneger's ad on BagNewsNotes today. (Or just click the ad at left.)  For those of you who don't live in California, this ad is just pathetic, and it's chock full of product placement. Idon't think I've ever seen this many brand names in a political commercial before. But, as BNN points out, it's also aesthetically just a terrible ad --- even by political ad standards which aren't very high.  It's not that it has some sort of cinema verite authenticity in its badness.  It's just ugly and ineffectual. This is the mega star of the 1980's we're talking about here.  The man whose entire claim to fame is his celebrity.  Yet his people produce an ad that could have been done by someone(with lots of high placed friends in the food and beverage business) running for the San Bernardino school board.  And it comes on the heels of months of very effective ads done by the public employees unions featuring the the sunny smiles of elementary schoolteachers and nurses and the rugged all American features of heroic firefighters. (Jon Stewart said \"those are some MILFS.\") Ithink that people expect Schwarzenneger's ads to be professional show business quality.  That is, after all, the only thing he's got going for him. Nobody voted for Arnold because of his great ideas or policy prescriptions.  He didn't have any then and he doesn't have any now. They did expect him to at least play the part of the Governor well on TV. But then again, he never was the actor Ronald Reagan was in the movies, either. And that's saying something. . digby 6/01/2005 09:33:00 AM | The Incredible Shrinking President Funny how we haven't seen any of the weekly news magazines do a cover story on the fact that Bush is the earliest lame duck in history.  Considering that they were writing Bill Clinton's epitaph within three months of his first term, one might conclude that they are using a different standard.  How unusual. But then again, it isn't his fault and it isn't his job. Unlike Clinton he doesn't have a congressional majority of his own party to lead.  Oh wait... Bush Rejects Talk of Waning Influence : President Bush dismissed yesterday suggestions that his influence is waning less than six months into his second term, blaming partisanship and timidity in Congress for the lack of action on his plans to bring change to the United Nations, restructure Social Security and enact a new energy policy this year. \"Idon't worry about anything here in Washington, D.C.,\" Bush said during a news conference in the White House's Rose Garden. \"Ifeel comfortable in my role as the president, and my role . . . is to push for reform.\" With Democrats and Republicans alike questioning the clout of a president whose approval ratings have sunk to new lows, Bush said it is Congress that must prove it is \"capable of getting anything done.\" His job is to \"push for reform?\" Ithought he was keeping the babies safe and fending off drone planes with his bare hands. What's going on here? The man with the codpiece can't get a Republican congress to enact his agenda? Man, those panting security moms must be disappointed. The difference between the 85% Collossus of 2002 and the petulant powerlessness of today is stark. And he clearly didn't like the way people were talking about his soul brother Vladimir: Speaking a few hours after former Russian oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sentenced to nine years in prison after a trial that many democratic activists called politically motivated, Bush said he has expressed concerns about the legal proceedings to President Vladimir Putin and will watch the appeals process closely. \"Here, you are innocent until proven guilty, and it appeared to us, at least people in my administration , that it looked like he had been judged guilty prior to having a fair trial,\" Bush said. Iguess he wanted to preserve his personal deniability for when he and Vlady next meet over beers and pork rinds at the ranch set. Or he just didn't see the problem.  After all, this is the man who said several thousand times that Saddam had to be disarmed and then pulled out the weapons inspectors when they didn't find the proof.  Seems to me that he has an affinity for the concept of judging guilty before having a fair trial. And, of course he and everyone in the press corpse are too thick to see the utter vacuity of his statement in light of what he said just a few minutes before about alleged human rights abuses Guantanamo: \"It seemed to me they based some of their decisions on the word of -- and the allegations -- by people who were held in detention, people who hate America, people that had been trained in some instances to disassemble -- that means not tell the truth,' Bush said.\" Yes, he actually said \"disassemble\" --- and then had the nerve to be snotty about it and define it. There is no end to the man's arrogance and ignorance. Bush apparently has no idea that when he starts lecturing Moscow or Beijing about \"fair trials\" everyone now collapses in convulsive laughter.  Guantanamo has changed forever the idea that Americans have a fair and impartial judicial system based upon the rule of law and the constitution.  Bush and his cronies have shown that we are more than capable of suspending those things at will.  If we ever had any moral authority, it has been officially flushed down the toilet. Not that it really matters to these people.  They don't believe that it's important to have moral authority.  They only believe that it's important to have big guns and a willingness to use them. Unfortunately, we don't seem to be all that good at the Empire building thing. Maybe keeping our moral authority backed by the threat of force rather than a clumsy and useless demonstration of our ineptitude might have been a better way to go. This is going to be a long 3 and a half years. But I'm beginning to think Imay enjoy them more than Junior will. . digby 6/01/2005 08:44:00 AM |"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "New Ideas This is good. Some in the administration are apparently questioning whether waging a \"Global War on Terror\" is an effective way to deal with the threat of islamic fundamentalism. Wow.  Next thing you know they'll be wondering whether taxes and expenditures ought to be in balance or something.  Weird. The review marks the first ambitious effort since the immediate aftermath of the 2001 attacks to take stock of what the administration has called the \"global war on terrorism\" -- or GWOT -- but is now considering changing to recognize the evolution of its fight. \"What we really want now is a strategic approach to defeat violent extremism,\" said a senior administration official who described the review on the condition of anonymity because it is not finished. \"GWOT is catchy, but there may be a better way to describe it, and those are things that ought to be incumbent on us to look at.\" Yeah.  \"GWOT\" is a catchy phrase that's been sweeping the nation like wildfire. So they've decided that what we really need is a strategic approach to defeat violent extremism.  Hmmm.  Ihave an idea.  How about we invade and occupy a non terrorist country in the middle of the region, create political chaos and foment a civil war? Surely that can only be seen as a gesture of goodwill on our part.  But just in case we should probably say that the country has nukes strapped to drone planes that are ready to attack the eastern seaboard at any moment.  (Nobody will remember any of that in a year anyway.) Well, maybe that's not such a hot idea after all. Much of the discussion has focused on how to deal with the rise of a new generation of terrorists, schooled in Iraq over the past couple years. Top government officials are increasingly turning their attention to anticipate what one called \"the bleed out\" of hundreds or thousands of Iraq-trained jihadists back to their home countries throughout the Middle East and Western Europe. \"It's a new piece of a new equation,\" a former senior Bush administration official said. \"If you don't know who they are in Iraq, how are you going to locate them in Istanbul or London?\" Interesting.  Who would have ever dreamed this could happen?  Oh, that's right.  Those of us who were against the invasion.  In fact, it was the central practical argument that Iand most others Iknow set forth at the time.  It was always obvious that invading Iraq was going to foment terrorism, not quell it.  Anybody with a sixth grade education could see that. Well, except for some Republicans who went to Andover, Yale and Harvard, that is. Ireally can't believe it.  After they just ran a ruthless, mendacious, presidential campaign of character assasination against anyone who diverted even a half step from their party line, here they are, basically admitting that their entire GWOT is a fucking goddamned mistake. The good news though is that just as they were before 9/11, the administration is focused like a laser beam on combatting terrorism: The review may have been slowed somewhat by the fact that many of the key counterterrorism jobs in the administration have been empty for months, including the top post at the State Department for combating terrorism, vacant since November, and the directorship of the new National Counterterrorism Center. \"We're five months into the next term, and still a number of spots have yet to be filled,\" Cressey said. \"You end up losing valuable time.\" The counterterrorism center was created nearly a year ago by Bush to serve as the main clearinghouse for terrorism-related intelligence but is not yet fully operational, and has been run by an acting director and caught up in the broader wave of bureaucratic reorganization that resulted in the creation of the new directorate of national intelligence, whose fiefdom the center will join. As part of the reorganization, a new office of strategic and operational planning is slated to become the focal point for operations aimed at terrorists, but that, too, has yet to start working fully, the senior counterterrorism official said. Townsend just hired a deputy last week, Treasury official Juan Carlos Zarate, to take on the terrorism portfolio at the NSC; Townsend had been doing that as well as serving as the president's top homeland security aide for the past year. Several counterterrorism sources said the State job will soon be filled by CIA veteran Hank Crumpton and the counterterrorism center post is slated to go to Air Force Gen. Charles F. Wald, current deputy commander of U.S. forces in Europe. \"They recognize there's been a vacuum of leadership,\" said a former top counterterrorism official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. \"There has been a dearth of senior leadership directing this day to day. No one knows who's running this on a day-to-day basis.\" Well, that's good.  We're creating terrorists by the thousands day after day but the administration can't get it together enough to hire the people it needs to fill the anti-terrorist positions.  The president himself is awfully busy, as we know, tilting at his private windmill accounts and riding his trike in the woods. Cheney is undoubtedly putting all his efforts into figuring out how to justify the use of tactical nuclear weapons on California. Who has time to deal with this terrorism thing? It's so 2002. Ooops, Iforgot one very important member of the administration who is working night and day on this problem. Karen Hughes has the vital responsibility of changing the negative perception of Americans in the middle east, which is key to their new strategy of combatting violent extremism. Ihear her latest campaign is about to be revealed: she's going to tell those terrorists and jihadists that the US is a compassionate crusader --- an occupier with optimism --- an inspirational imperialist with integrity! Once those terrorists hear the mellifluous melody of her awesome alliteration, just like the Red States they will all fall in love. Update: James Wolcott tells us that Michael Ledeen is just hopping mad about all this \"re-evaluation\" business. You can certainly understand why.  He's the guy who seriously made the case to invade France and Germany just two years ago. This has to be a blow. Twice in the past, the president slid into a similar funk, first permitting himself to be gulled by the Saudis into believing he had to make a deal with Arafat before he was entitled to liberate Iraq, then permitting the British to drag out the run-up to Operation Iraqi Freedom with endless votes in the Security Council. Each time he realized his error, and pressed on with greater vigor. Its time for him to do that again.\" The 101st Keyboarders need to saddle up their Aaron chairs and cock their control buttons.  This is bigger even than the GWOT.  It's a fight for the Codpiece and that's a battle only they know how to fight with the relish and expertise that's called for. They may have lost their beloved leader General Sullivan, but they will valiantly carry on without him. These brave souls will never give in, never give in, never give in. . digby 5/31/2005 06:29:00 PM | Spent Capital I'm Baaaack. Sorry for the interruption in service folks.  I've been indisposed, but now I'm right as rain and ready to rumble.  Or thunder.  Or something... And what do Isee first thing? Bush's Political Capital Spent, Voices in Both Parties Suggest. Sweet. Two days after winning reelection last fall, President Bush declared that he had earned plenty of \"political capital, and now Iintend to spend it.\" Six months later, according to Republicans and Democrats alike, his bank account has been significantly drained. In the past week alone, the Republican-led House defied his veto threat and passed legislation promoting stem cell research; Senate Democrats blocked confirmation, at least temporarily, of his choice for U.N. ambassador; and a rump group of GOP senators abandoned the president in his battle to win floor votes for all of his judicial nominees. With his approval ratings in public opinion polls at the lowest level of his presidency, Bush has been stymied so far in his campaign to restructure Social Security. On the international front, violence has surged again in Iraq in recent weeks, dispelling much of the optimism generated by the purple-stained-finger elections back in January, while allies such as Egypt and Uzbekistan have complicated his campaign to spread democracy. The series of setbacks on the domestic front could signal that the president has weakened leverage over his party, a situation that could embolden the opposition, according to analysts and politicians from both sides. Bush faces the potential of a summer of discontent when his capacity to muscle political Washington into following his lead seems to have diminished and few easy victories appear on the horizon. Well, yes.  But it's because he never had any political capital to begin with. This was a big lie, just like the alleged mandate.  He had neither.  There was just enough of a fading vestige of 9/11 around (and enough of the media's unctuous sycophancy) to keep a little of that hi-pro glow on the Prez.  But he never had a mandate for any of his policies. These guys rode a wave, they didn't win a landslide. At some point hype, like helium, dissipates and you are left with nothing but the flaccid balloon. Junior and Rove are not geniuses or political wizards who have reshaped politics in their image. They are the guys who got in on a hummer in 2000 and were in office on 9/11.  Period.  The only truly impressive legislative victory has been passing massive tax cuts for rich people, which is hardly a difficult thing to ask politicians to do when you also break open the pork barrel and let them gorge on all the pig they can possibly stomach. That's quite an achievement. The fact is that Junior has been a lame duck since January 21, 2005. And Ibelieve he's happy with that.  All he ever cared about was getting legitimately elected and doing what his father did not --- win a second term. He doesn't give a damn about legacy. As he famously said, \"History, we dont know. Well all be dead.\" He's just going through the motions, like a high school senior who's already been accepted to college. The Republican caucus is under new leadership --- the GOP PepBoys Dobson, Frist and DeLay. I'm beginning to look forward to 2006. . digby 5/31/2005 03:56:00 PM |"}]}

It was the year everything changed. by Sergio Non"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "February 11, 2004 - Talk all you want about special effects, spaceships and alien costumes, but above all, the enduring mark of great sci-fi is ideas. It's especially true for sci-fi TV shows, which love to bludgeon viewers with Major Themes: Being Human (Spock, Data, The Doctor, various clones); Cultural Diversity (aliens, we love you); What Is Real? (time travel; holodecks; shape shifters); Privacy and Individual Rights (telepaths); Religion (The Force); and of course, The Meaning of Life (Yoda). But Babylon 5 wielded the biggest, bluntest instrument of all, and it smashed through season four to create an outsized beast of grandiosity. Everything about this set screams of self-conscious ambition. The Show Ultimately, Babylon 5 was all about the ideas of its creator and executive producer J. Michael Straczynski, who wrote the screenplays for the majority of the shows, including every episode of the last two seasons. His ambition dominated Babylon 5 throughout its run: \"I'm pretty rigorous in my scripts most of the time. Idon't tend to allow for a lot of improvisation or a lot of changing around.\" The content certainly drips with self-importance -- operatic music; exaggerated, acting; didactic dialogues about Really Important Topics; sweeping shots of battle -- and in its desperate attempt to be taken seriously, Babylon 5 ends up stagey and affected. Why show consequences when his characters can tell us (and tell us and tell us and tell us) about them? Who needs naturalistic dialogue when there's preaching to be done? What's the use of small gestures when gesticulation can chew up the camera? Why cap the big showdown between Shadows and Vorlons with an exciting fight when you can end with a long-winded Sheridan speech? Viewers might have thought the Shadow conflict - which powered the show for much of Babylon 5's first three years -- would take an entire season to complete, but it was resolved by the sixth show, Into the Fire , making the next 16 episodes feel a bit like one long denouement."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "By the time Babylon 5 finally delivers a massive space battle in episode 20, Endgame , it's hard to care. It didn't help that Straczynski mixed senseless space battle cliches like all-weapons-and-shields-are-down-so-let's-ram-them with one clever idea involving telepaths and ships. Yet the maddening and unintentionally comic elements of Babylon 5 often worked. Sometimes the outsized, over-the-top acting and dialogue approaches brilliance. The devious, sneering Ambassador Londo Mollari might be one of the greatest TV sci-fi characters of all time, and his actor, Peter Jurasik, gets to bluster and show off his outlandish accent to full effect in season four. Mira Furlan's breathless portrayal of Ambassador Delenn and Jerry Doyle's smartass, grumpy cop take on Chief Garibaldi are weirdly compelling. And for all his wordiness, Straczynski can write remarkable scenes. Season 4's last episode, The Deconstruction of Falling Stars , offered a microcosm of the show's best and worst traits. Set up as a far-future historian's look back at the effect of Babylon 5 on Earth history, the script insists on  extolling the greatness of Sheridan and his cohorts - you can't get more heavy-handed than Delenn glaring at a trio of academic strawmen and wheezing that Sheridan \"was a good man.\""}, {"tag": "p", "text": "On the other hand, Deconstruction includes a wonderful vignette that -- in a nod to the classic novel Canticle for Leibowitz --  features an older monk defending the Babylon 5 \"myth\" against the questions of his younger colleague; it's a touching, eloquent defense of religious belief, and especially surprising coming from a skeptic like Straczynski. Lots to dislike, but even more to love. The ideas and their build-up make Babylon 5 worth watching, especially in its climactic season. If only the payoff were better.

Considering this is a science-fiction show with some fairly sophisticated 3D graphics, it wouldn't have been asking too much to clean up the video for DVD distribution. Instead, the ongoing insistence on painting Babylon 5 as an Epic For Our Time may have actually made picture quality worse on DVDs. The live action sequences were shot in 16:9 format with high-definition television screens in mind, but to save money, the special effects were created for 4:3 viewing. Thus, all CGI effects are, in effect, blown-up on the DVDs, which present the show 16:9, in keeping with Straczynski's original vision. The end result? For any scene with special effects, including composite shots that mix live-action and CGI, the same problems noted in IGN's previous review exist here: graininess, jagged edges and digital errors, even on non-HD television sets. If you don't have a high-definition television, try watching this on a PC's DVD player -- you may find yourself wondering if you're watching a DivX downloaded from the Internet or an actual DVD.

As far as the show itself, careful listeners will pick up a few incidental noises, as well as echo effects of computer voices -- check out the final sequence in Deconstruction for a good sample.

AP says this has been confirmed by FAO, but New Scientist says evidence is \"indirect\" (according to a different FAO source), where \"indirect\" means the North Koreans prepared a vaccine from the sick birds and the vaccinated birds showed antibodies to H7. If the infection is with H7 subtype this would seem to be good news as human cases with H7 have not been particularly severe. H7N2 has been reported in poultry in the US (Delaware) and H7N7 caused a large outbreak in poultry in 2003 in The Netherlands which jumped to humans. Most cases manifested as conjunctivitis (\"pink eye\") and a small number (3) showed typical influenza-like symptoms (cough, fever, muscle aches). The only serious case involved a veterinarian who visited one of the farms and developed fatal respiratory distress syndrome. Relatively mild disease, yes. But the fly in the ointment is that this avian virus also showed itself to be quite transmissible to and among people. Eighty-three cases were reported initially among poultry workers with three possible subsequent transmissions to family members. Afollow-up blood study with 500 farmers, their families and workers involved in the massive cull initially showed no antibodies to H7, even in those with confirmed infection. It turned out the hemagglutination assay (to see if a subject's blood serum made red blood cells clump together, a standard test for prior infection) worked with horse red blood cells, not the standard turkey rbcs. Even using horse rbcs, only about 50% of the previously infected patients showed agglutination, still not very sensitive. Using the modified assay, Dutch investigators estimated that at least 1000 and perhaps as many as 2000 people may have been infected.

This process, assures Dr. Martineau, will yield an interesting result. Before sharing my insight, I'd like to make a comment about Carr's stories. As Ihad already read past \"Tanoo\" for today's class, Iwould need to re-read it once again. To peak my curiosity and hopefully uncover some life facts about Carr, Iread Ira Dilworth's foreword. Dilworth writes about Carr's \"peeling\" of sentences to strip \"all ambiguous and unnecessary worlds, replacing a vague word by a sharper, clearer one until the sentence emerged clean and precise in its meaning and strong in its impact on the reader.\" With this armed knowledge, Ifound myself reading radically slower than usual, sometimes rereading a sentence two, three, something even four times trying to absorb, and reabsorb any uncaptured meanings like words of gold. By reading this way, Icaught passages Ihad previously missed. In fact, it altered my first perception of the story. And after reading the 1941 edition, my perception of the Irwin edition once again altered, even more dramatically, this time. The mentioning of the missionary's daughter accompanying Carr on her excursion to Tanoo with Jimmie and Louisa, Ithought, was Carr's way of retelling in detail, every aspect of the trip. In fact, Ifound both \"Ucluelet,\" the first story in the book, set in a tone where missionaries were sympathetic and cordial with aboriginal peoples, such as their interaction with the Chief (In \"Sophie\") and with Mrs. Wynook. The notorious treatment of aboriginal families by European missionaries is well-known. Missionaries, recalls Carr, laughed at the tradition of totem poles, calling them heathenish. The missionary's daughter, whom upholds a \"superior\" European culture, found Jimmie and Louisa's habits savage-like, as shown in her refusal to try devilfish and exclaiming Tanoo, a place of spiritual value, as a \"Horrid place!\" Iwonder why the later edition of \"Tanoo\" deletes certain passages, notably those in which Europeans are sneering at the aboriginal way of life. We know Carr is unbiased; she commit herself to understanding Native culture. She does not directly judge the missionary's daughter, introducing her as the missionary's \"pretty daughter.\" During the story, Carr only goes as far as calling her \"Miss Missionary,\" perhaps a sarcastic way of direct us to the pushiness of the girl. My belief is that Carr's European audience met her work(s) with harsh criticism. As a result, for profitability's sake, it is necessary to blot out racial statements for Europeans' who look to Carr's books to acquire knowledge about First Nations people."}]}

{"file_number": "54", "plaintext": [{"tag": "h1", "text": "Standing in the Way of Ceremony: Production Code Objections to The Bride of Frankenstein"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "The year was 1931. Universal was a struggling Hollywood studio. Salvation\ncame from an unexpected place: the horror film. February saw the blockbuster\nrelease of Dracula , and only eight months later Frankenstein was released to become an even bigger hit. Inevitably this success\nled the studio to pursue a sequel, and in 1935 Universal released The Bride of Frankenstein , returning the director (James\nWhale) and most of the original cast. The film was a spectacular success\nat the box office. What the average 1935 movie-goer saw in the theater,\nthough, was a film heavily tweaked from the original script Whale\nhad been pursuing. Unlike its predecessor, The Bride of Frankenstein was exposed to the heavy hand of Joe Breen and the Production Code\nAdministration; a review of the shooting script and notes Breen wrote\nto the producers reveal forced alterations that change the nature\nof the film and its characters. When the original Frankenstein was released in 1931 the Production\nCode had not yet been put into enforcement. Censorship was yet the\ndominion of various local and state film boards. Though these groups\ncut various scenes from the screened prints of the original, there\nwas no federal censorship to deal with until the film's re-release\nin 1937 (Manguel 14). Bride of Frankenstein , however, had\nto deal with the Production Code Administration from the beginning.\nMany cases of censorship centered around the depiction of the female\nform and sexuality, but for the most part the issues raised in Bride\nof Frankenstein were ones of violence and religion. Breen, as a devout Catholic, was especially sensitive to unfavorable\nportrayals of religion in the movies. In this film Breen was especially\nworried by any scenes that would compare Frankenstein to God. Very\nearly on in the process he cautioned the studio against pursuing this\nobvious analogy. ``Throughout the script there are a number of\nreferences to Frankenstein ... which compare him to God and which\ncompare his creation of the monster to God's creation of man.'' Here\nBreen was blunt: ``All such references should be deleted'' (Gardner\n66). The subject matter was too tied to the comparison for such an\nultimatum to be completely followed, however, and a back-and-forth\non the topic went on throughout the production process. In one scene\nof the shooting script Frankenstein intensely monologues: ``Icould\nhave bred a race and have found perhaps the secret of eternal life.\nAll that was in my brain -- my very grasp. Iconceived it -- it was\nlike being God!'' (Riley B-7) Predictably, Joe Breen was not amused.\nHe suggested omitting the line, saying that it had in the past ``proven\nsomewhat blasphemous'' (Gardner 67). Whaler responded by offering\nto refer to ``being the Creator'' instead, but in the end the\noffered proved moot as the entire line was cut from the theatrical\nprint. Later in the sequence Dr. Pretorius was to derisively tell\nFrankenstein to ``follow the lead of Nature ... or of God -- if\nyou are fond of your fairy tales'' (Riley B-26). Breen wanted the\nline cut; Whaler instead changed ``fairy tales'' to ``Bible\nstories.'' Another religiously oriented cut provides a good example of the way\nin which Code-required cuts could alter the attitude of a scene. While\nrunning from a pursuing mob Frankenstein's monster happens into a\ncemetery. The script called for the monster to happen upon an ``imposing\nmonument'' depicting Christ on the cross (F-8). The monster, in a\nshow of compassion, tries to help the stricken figure, thinking it\nto be a human mistreated as he has been. The monster's effort ends\nup toppling the monument, revealing the crypt entrance below. Breen\nobjected to the scene, saying that Whaler ``should omit the figure\nof the statue of the Christ from this scene, substituting some other\ntype of monument'' (Gardner 67). Changing the monument, however,\nchanges how the audience views the monster's actions. Instead of attempting\nto be compassionate, the monster is instead shown lashing out at a\nrandom statue, toppling it in an act that is far more aggressive than\nthe original was to be. Though Breen meant only to prevent a conservative\npublic from finding offense in the scene, the effect of his action\nwas to force upon the monster an entirely different motivation. Aside from depictions of religion, Breen was primarily concerned with\nthe gruesomeness and violence the film promised. Even after primary\nshooting had ended Breen wrote to Universal warning them that the\nfilm would not get its seal as it then stood. ``This picture seems\nto us definitely to be a violation of our Production Code,'' he wrote\nthem, ``because of its excessive brutality and gruesomeness''\n(69). Scenes already filmed were targeted for removal. Early in the\nfilm a man and his wife are left standing by the burning wreckage\nof the mill as the crowd that watched the monster destroyed wanders\noff. The man moves closer, wanting his eyes to confirm for him that\nthe monster was truly dead. Instead the man falls into the water below\nand comes face-to-face with a monster very much alive. The man is\nkilled, and as the monster crawls up to the surface the wife is brought\nto a similar fate. The script gave a scene in which the drama between\nmonster and man unfolded slowly; Breen wanted the man's drowning to\ngo unshown. He also wanted deleted the shot of the monster pulling\nthe wife into the water. He won one and lost one, as Universal cut\nthe drowning scene but kept the image of the wife being tossed to\nher death. Later there is a scene where the monster kills a small\ngirl. This body is viewed by a group of ``little girls coming out\nof church in their white dresses'' and later carried through the\nstreets by the mother. The final print of the film still contained\nthe shot of the girls viewing the off-camera body, but cut the one\nthat would have shown the body itself (69). Breen was concerned not just with visuals that might upset the public,\nbut dialogue choices as well. The opening shots of the film originally\nincluded a scene where Mary Shelley says that she, her poet husband,\nand Lord Byron are ``all three infidels, scoffers at all marriage\nties, believing only in living fully and freely in whatever direction\nthe heart dictates'' (Riley A-5). The line, along with most of those\nmeant for these three, was cut completely from the theatrical print.\nElsewhere Breen got detailed enough to be squirmish about the word\n``entrails,'' getting it replaced with ``insides.'' (Gardner\n67-68). Breen also took objection to the idea of the monster as a\nsexual creature. Reviewing an early script he wrote that ``the\nmonster's use of the word ``mate'' should be dropped in this scene.\nAll material which suggests he desires a sexual companion is objectionable.\nWe suggest you substitute the word ``companion'''' (66). In the\nend the monster does refer to his soon-to-be-created partner as a\n``wife,'' though whether this implies more or less of a sexual\nconnotation than mate is debatable (Riley F-16). Only a few of the scenes censored in Bride of Frankenstein involved sexuality. In the scene where Dr. Pretorius shows Frankenstein\nhis created miniature creatures, one of the jars contains a tiny mermaid.\nBreen wrote that, ``The scene of the miniature mermaid should be\nhandled in such a way as to avoid any improper exposure'' (Gardner\n67). The shooting script made gave no guidance on what the mermaid\nshould look like, but the final release made sure the mermaid was\nwell-clothed. Cut entirely from the film were scenes in which Mary\nShelley was considered to be showing too much of her breasts.

However refilming the entire sequence\nwas too costly and in the final shot before the tower is destroyed\nFrankenstein is seen still inside, even though just previously he\nhad been shown to leave. In the end Breen gave Bride of Frankenstein a seal despite\nthe fact that it had not addressed all the objections he had raised.\nJust because the Production Code Administration signed off on the\nfilm did not mean the rest of the way was smooth sailing, though.\nBreen warned Universal to expect trouble with other censoring agencies:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "It is more than likely that this picture will meet with considerably\ndifficulty at the hands of [state and local] censor boards both\nin this country and abroad.

This assessment, which was originally reached by the CIA, is sharedby all leading government officials, ranging from President George Bushand Vice President Dick Cheney, to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and other officials. The talks indicate that the Americans have written off President Assad; as far as they are concerned he does not exist, and they are already looking ahead and planning the day after the fall of the Syrian regime and the end of the Alawite minority rule in Damascus. From the American viewpoint, Bashar Assad has in fact taken over the dubious position left open by Yasser Arafat, and is now disqualified andwritten off in precisely the manner that the Americans wrote off Arafat before him.  The reasons for this are varied: the Syrian double game with regard to terrorism, the role that the Syrians are playing in Iraq, the Syrian conduct in Lebanon and the general Syrian functioning vis-a-vis the US administration. In closed conversations, the Americans, including President Bush, say that Assad is a \"peculiar fellow\" who cannot be counted on, hopes cannot be pinned on him, and [the US] should wait until he disappears from the political scene.  The administration believes that the Syrian people are ripe to begin a democratic process.  \"In Syria too, people are aware of what is happening around the world and in the region,\" say the Americans.  On the other hand, officials in Washington express grave concern with regard to what is expected in Lebanon.  It is feared that following the Syrian pullout and the beginning of the democratic process, Lebanon will undergo an internal collapse due to the high level of internal ethnic tension in the country."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "\" The EU adds to Syria's international woes : Brussels links Euro-med accord with damascus' politics in lebanon,\" writes Will Rasmussen of the Daily Star, April 08, 2005. The EU finally broke cover this week in announcing it will not sign a billion-dollar trade pact with Syria until key European demands on Lebanon are met. The EU has insisted on a full withdrawal from Lebanon and parliamentary elections without interference from Syria. Without the deal, the Syrian economy will lose an important lifeline, but more importantly, the EU's decision signals that the international isolation of the Syrian government will increase. Syria had hoped that signing the agreement, which gives Damascus greater access to EU markets, would drive a wedge between Europe and America. Demanding that Syria tighten its borders with Iraq and stop supporting anti-Israel groups such as Hizbullah, the U.S. has imposed a raft of sanctions on Damascus, which does not mean much economically, but puts a political squeeze on Syrian President Bashar Assad. Europe, though, continued to pursue a different strategy of engagement with Syria, even initialing the trade pact last October - a month after Resolution 1559 was passed. The association agreement involves billions of dollars of aid to Damascus as well as the creation of an EU-Syrian free trade zone. But finally, the EU seems to have lost patience, as The Daily Star first predicted last month. Frank Hesske, EU ambassador to Syria, said this week: \"Idon't see how we could consider a signature earlier than ... fulfillment of these two conditions: full, verifiable withdrawal of troops and intelligence services and the issue of what we really see on the ground, free, transparent elections or not.\" The deal is still in administrative limbo, awaiting translation of its 1,500 pages into EU languages. It must be unanimously passed by all 25 EU members and could be signed at the earliest by June. Syria has a positive trade balance with the EU of about $1 billion, largely due to its petroleum exports, but its economy is suffering from a negative growth rate and high unemployment. When The Daily Star first queried European officials last month, they hinted that signing the agreement would be contingent on whether Syria withdraws its troops from Lebanon. But the Europeans are expanding their scope and toughening their line against Damascus. Now, they're insisting on a second condition: that Syria respects free and transparent elections in Lebanon, which the Lebanese opposition is already accusing the Syrian-backed Karami government of delaying. Last week, the EU enraged Damascus by inviting Syrian opposition leader Farid Ghadry, who recently met top U.S. State Department officials in Washington, to Brussels to argue his case for why the agreement should be delayed. Ghadry, who heads the Reform Party of Syria, said the treaty shouldn't be ratified until Syria improves its human rights record and introduces democratic reforms. According to Ghadry, the trade agreement is a key opportunity to pressure Damascus, which is the only country in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership - which brings together 25 EU countries and their 12 Mediterranean neighbors - not to sign an agreement. \"The regime of Assad is desperate to sign the agreement because it shows that it can isolate the Europeans from the Americans,\" Ghadry told The Daily Star. Ghadry said: \"Not only will it give Syria an economic boost that we think will again only benefit the elite but it will also give the regime a political boost, something the Reform Party of Syria does not want at this time. \"The EU trade with Syria represents approximately 40 percent of Syria's GDP, so it's very important for them.\" Ghadry urged the EU to leverage the trade agreement not just to free Lebanon from Assad's grip but to improve its human rights record. \"The only reform possible is the lifting of the emergency laws, release of all prisoners, changing the Constitution to accept all political parties and dismantling the intelligence services,\" said Ghadry. \"If these are done, then we can start a meaningful dialogue to transition the country into a full-fledged democracy.\" Ghadry's demands are further than the EU has signaled it is willing to push. It doesn't seem likely, though, that the agreement will be signed before June, when the EU presidency changes hands and new political priorities could come into play. Until then, Syria's pariah status will continue, unless, of course, it shows a willingness to cooperate fully in Lebanon."}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Daily Press Briefing Tom Casey, Director, Office of Press Relations Washington, DC April 15, 2005 * * * QUESTION: Asharq al-Awsat newspaper said today that President Bush will not deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and the U.S. is not pleased at all from the Syria's policies.

Then Ifinished my special field exams and was told to go write some research. Icompare my experience to learning how to read literature, then being asked to do\r\ncreative writing. Not unrelated, but hardly the same set of skills. Here is\r\nsome advice Ifound helpful when Iwas searching for a topic. Hints for finding paper topics : Choosing a paper topic requires\r\nbalancing the importance and feasibility of the topic. Feasibility involves\r\ntractability for theoretical research, and data availability for empirical\r\nresearch. Irecommend creating a number of one-page paper proposals, each with\r\na topic sentence and data source. There are several heuristics for finding researchable paper topics. One way\r\nis to list three of four papers you like. This list may hint at the style,\r\npolitical point of view, level of abstraction, and methods that are appropriate\r\nfor you. Other paper ideas are motivated by bad research, not good: find statements\r\nby policy-makers, analysts and journalists that make you angry, and find data\r\nsets to address the issue. When studying for exams, keep a list of stupid\r\nthings you read to return to during the dissertation stage. Don't be afraid of normal science: repeating in a longitudinal data set what\r\nothers have done only in the cross section. Some paper ideas are data-driven:\r\nread codebooks from a variety of data sets and see if certain questions spark\r\nideas or tests of theories you find interesting. For every paper you read,\r\nthink what else you would have done with that dataset or methodology. Write a paper , not a dissertation. Adissertation can be a daunting\r\nprospect. If possible, focus on a 25-page paper with a clear one-sentence\r\ntopic. If you like this paper, then it can become the basis of a dissertation.\r\nIpromise you that just about any topic can grow to 150 pages; nearly all\r\ntopics students first choose are WAY too broad. Adissertation is any stack of papers with three signatures on the top sheet .\r\nPaul Samuelson's dissertation was modestly entitled Foundations of Economics . It lived up to that title, and remains a\r\nclassic to this day. Iinitially felt that my dissertation should be, if not\r\nthat good, at least vaguely comparable in the sense of answering one of the Big\r\nQuestions. Do not fall prey, as Idid, to the \"magnum opus fallacy\". Adissertation should be normal science that certifies your competency. Save the\r\nbig thoughts in a file, and get finished! Write an opus when you are a professor,\r\nand are being paid for it. Meanwhile, negotiate the smallest useful chunk of\r\nthe Big Project with your dissertation advisers, and do that single piece of\r\nresearch. Adissertation group is essential . Having folks to bounce your ideas\r\noff of at an early stage is irreplaceable. The members of your dissertation\r\ngroup do not need to have similar fields; any smart person will be useful at\r\neach stage of a project, from vague ideas through research design, and write\r\nup. All you need are people who are willing to listen to raw ideas, and willing\r\nto read first \"pre-drafts\" of chapters. This is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice.

Thus, my basic\r\nadvice is focus your research, get it read, and get seen. Sadly, the visibility\r\nof yourself is as important as the quality of your work in professional\r\nsuccess. Have a theme : You should think of your research as writing a book,\r\nnot articles. The idea is that your first five years' research should involve\r\none or two unifying themes. The reason for sticking to a theme is that people evaluating you need to be\r\nable to say \"This young scholar is one of the world's experts at\r\n_______.\" You get to fill the blank. However, your work must hold together\r\nso that there is some word or phrase they can stick in the blank. In an ideal world, academics would be able to study any important topic they\r\nwere competent to shed light on. In the real world, assistant professors are\r\nbeing evaluated; you don't need to play the game Idescribe, but now you know\r\nthe rules. Get read : List people who should read your papers. The list should\r\ninclude at least three groups: a dozen or so senior people in your field who\r\nare likely to write letters evaluating you when you go up for tenure;\r\nclassmates and other buddies who are likely to actually read the stuff; and\r\npeople who work on related topics and you would like to cite your stuff. Make\r\nup a master list that receives most papers, and modify it for each paper. Look\r\nat each paper's bibliography for ideas on who might want to see it. (Everyone\r\nwants to see papers that cite them -- that's why so many professors read papers\r\nfrom the back.) Typically you should mail out papers in their working paper stage, one draft\r\nbefore submission. Feedback is crucial. All research has flaws, and all drafts have\r\neasy-to-correct flaws. Make sure your research and writing has lots of feedback\r\nto fix both types. Especially for the clarity issues, be open minded. If your\r\nparents, friends, colleagues in unrelated disciplines, will read the sucker,\r\nsend it to them! Get seen : Travel every year to give seminars. If you are going to be\r\nnear a university, call up six months early and tell them you are available and\r\nwould like to give a seminar. Don't be shy: figure out how to give a talk at your field's annual\r\nconvention, and do it! Invite a mix of friends and more well-known people. Learn how to be a Manager : Secretaries and research assistants are\r\njust a few of the people you need to learn to manage. The secrets are few:\r\nrespect and communication. Respect is shown, for example, by asking their\r\nschedule when you propose work, and by always saying, \"Thank you.\" In\r\naddition, if they have expertise in a job, only give advice on how to do it if\r\nthey ask. Most attempts at communication are not completely successful. (In the\r\nclassroom this problem is reflected in my maxim: \"Ican teach faster than\r\nthey can learn.\") Thus, the golden rule of communication is \"Say unto\r\nothers what you believe others have said unto you.\" After giving your\r\ninstructions, always ask your RA to explain what she thought you asked her to\r\ndo. (Do this in a way that makes it clear you consider yourself at fault for\r\nany miscommunication. Perhaps: \"Ididn't explain that very well. Can you\r\ntell me what you are planning to do?\") If they don't repeat back to me\r\ntheir understanding of my instructions, then it is unlikely the job will be\r\naccomplished as Iexpect. Budget your research time : In economics research begun in year t\r\nusually leads to a first draft in year t+1 or t+2. Circulating it and\r\npresenting it at a seminar or two brings us to year t+3. Submit it to a journal\r\nand they will (if you are lucky) ask for a revision in year t+4, which you\r\nmight complete that year. If so, they could accept it as fast as year t+5, but\r\nit might not come out till year t+6. On the one hand, many papers can move from\r\nconception to publication in less than six years; on the other hand, many\r\npapers take more. Count back from the time you need to submit your tenure file. If you are\r\nthree years away and your case is less than 100% solid, don't begin any new\r\nresearch! At this point your priority must be to move working papers and papers\r\nwith requested revisions into the Accepted pile. This is just one in a series of David Levine's Cheap Advice.

Thus, tables\r\nmust be comprehensible by themselves. That is, a reader should be able to\r\nunderstand a table without reference to the text (and preferably without\r\nreference to other tables). The converse rule is that the text should stand by\r\nitself, even if a reader ignores the tables. Variable names should be self-explanatory. The text should flow\r\nwithout ever showing that the reader has encountered a variable name. For\r\nexample, \"Each plant visit by a social scientist corresponded to 3.1%\r\nhigher voluntary turnover per month (SE = .9%, P < .05)\" is much better\r\nthan \"The coefficient of SCISTUD on VOLTUR was .031 (.009),\" which is\r\nbetter than \"Sand Vwere significantly related.\" In short, nobody\r\nshould know what passed between you and your computer in the middle of the\r\nnight. Name your dummy variable Male or Female , but not Sex . Often variables are proxies for conceptual variables. If you want to measure\r\ncomplexity, but your variable is log(employment), name the variable employment (if all variables are expressed in logs) or log(employment) , not complexity . Each table has number and a meaningful title: \"Wages Do Not Rise\r\nwith Tenure,\" not \"Wages.\" All statistical tests include the name of the test, the test statistic, and\r\nthe significance level. Include a brief description of complex procedures at\r\nthe bottom of the table. Remind readers of the meaning of complicated\r\nvariables. Each estimated equation lists the dependent variable and sample size.\r\nIf one of these is constant for an entire table, list it only once. Always\r\ninclude measures of goodness of fit such as Ror log-likelihood. Usually\r\ninclude a test of the significance of the entire regression (such as an Ftest\r\nfor ordinary least squares), and appropriate residual diagnostics (such as\r\nDurbin-Watson statistics and heteroskedasticity tests). Coefficients should include standard errors or t statistics, and some\r\nindication of statistical significance (Pvalues or * for P < .05,\r\n** for P < .01). Anote explains whether there are standard errors or t\r\nstatistics. Report P < .10 only if the sample size is small. For very large datasets it makes sense to\r\ndemand a higher degree of certainty, so only report P < .01. Include a meaningful number of digits, usually at two or three significant\r\nplaces. Neither .34849560 (3.132534) nor 0.00 (SE = 0.00, P < .001) is\r\nuseful. Sometimes multiply or divide a variable by 10 so the coefficient is in\r\na meaningful range. Always in the text, and often in the tables, translate the coefficients of\r\ninterest into words. For example, convert logit coefficients to measure how a\r\none-unit change in the variable affects the probability of the occurrence of\r\nthe event (dP/dX). Translate hazard rate coefficients to show how a one unit\r\nchange in the variable affects the expected time until some event occurs:\r\n\"If the union local is in a city, its expected lifetime was four months\r\nshorter than if it was rural.\" Also, always explain whether the effect is large or not, perhaps by\r\ncomparing its size to something readers understand. For example, the importance\r\nof marital status on wages can be expressed as how many years of education are\r\nrequired to raise wages by as much. Sometimes standardized coefficients\r\n(expressed in standard deviation units) are useful: \"Aone month increase\r\nin training (approximately one standard deviation) corresponds to 4 percent\r\nlower turnover (approximately one half of a standard deviation).\" Effect sizes from Lisrel, factor analysis, path analysis, ordered logits,\r\netc., are hard to understand. Thus, explain the size as well as the statistical\r\nsignificance of the important effects. Statistical significance : Most authors focus on whether coefficients\r\nare statistically significantly different from zero at the 5 percent\r\nlevel. Thus, if b 1 is\r\nstatistically significant from zero at the 5% level, but b 2 is not,\r\nsome authors write as if b 1 is different from and more important\r\nthan b 2 . At a minimum, authors\r\nshould focus on confidence intervals, and explicitly test if b 1 and\r\nb 2 differ by statistically significant amounts. Summary statistics should be included for the referee, although they do\r\nnot always need to be in the paper. Usually include means, standard deviations,\r\nunits, sources, geographical region covered, and sample size. Usually include\r\nsummary statistics for control variables as well as for the main variables of\r\ninterest. Include the statistics for the un-logged version of any important\r\nvariables you use in log form. If your paper computes important and meaningful\r\nintermediate results (residuals from a first-stage equation, for example),\r\ninclude their summary statistics. Often give the referee a table of correlations of either the main variables\r\nor of all the variables. Use simple statistical procedures to complement fancier analyses. Many\r\npapers have a simple comparison of means as their main result (to be formalized\r\nand measured more precisely in later sections). If your paper has such a\r\ncomparison at its core, then present the unadjusted means (e.g., men vs. women,\r\nor U.S. vs. Japan ) before\r\nthe fancier statistical analysis. Figures and graphs , like tables, are supposed to be comprehensible\r\nwithout reference to the text, and the text without reference to the figure.\r\nPlace labels (in words, not symbols or variable names) and units on axes. Equations worthy of being in your paper can be expressed as a\r\nsentence. Do so. Many economic theories generate an interesting first-order\r\ncondition. Restate it in words: \"At the optimum, a dollar spent today must\r\nbring the same utility as a dollar spent tomorrow, suitably discounted.\" Abstracts present the question the paper will answer. Since social\r\nscientists are not mystery writers, abstracts also summarize the results.\r\nInability to write an abstract of fewer than 100 words often indicates deeper\r\nproblems with the paper."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Robustness checks and limitations of the study"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "No research is perfect. This section presents a checklist of common\r\nimperfections in empirical research. Discuss the limitations of your paper and\r\nplausible alternate explanations for the results. Surveys face problems with the match between the actual sample and\r\nthe perfect sample. Always mention the response rates and possible response\r\nbiases. Are responses likely to be sensitive to changes in the wording of the\r\nquestions? Do respondents have incentives to hide their attitudes? Are\r\nattitudes likely to match behaviors? Anaming issue appears when data undergo factor analysis or are summed into\r\nan index. Do not merely name the factors or indices, but present a sample of\r\nthe questions along with the factor weights. Differentiate exploratory from\r\nconfirmatory factor analysis. Econometric and statistical analyses are subject to all the\r\ndifficulties of surveys. They also fall prey to the \"textbook\r\nchapters:\" simultaneity, sample selection, measurement error, outliers,\r\nand so forth.

If you tell one group\r\nof people they are not worth the wage they receive, this treatment may affect\r\nself-esteem as well as perceived equity. Thus, naming the treated group perceived\r\ninequity can mislead readers. Case studies have limited generalizability. Explain in what sense\r\nthis case study generalizes, and outline the limits of its generalizability.\r\nWhat are the likely biases due to subjective perception and reporting? Causality is almost never clear in the social sciences. Common\r\nproblems include reverse causality, selection effects, and omitted variable\r\nbias. Discuss alternative causal explanations for the results. These alternative channels often suggest\r\nadditional tests you might perform. When using instrumental variables or multi-equation methods such as\r\ntwo-stage least squares and maximum likelihood, always list your instruments or\r\nother identifying assumptions. Include these lists in both the text and the\r\ntables. Justify why it is plausible that your instruments are exogenous. Both\r\nidentification by functional form (as in many sample selection models) and\r\ninstrumenting with lagged variables require strong justification. Economic theory : Explain the robustness of the results in\r\n\"assumption space.\" Differentiate assumptions that are crucial from\r\nthose that merely simplify.

Here, the Oscar-winning director Walter Salles explains why it had to be made Saturday  December  21, 2002 The Guardian It begins with a chicken who knows too much. We are in City of God, a  favela (a Rio de Janeiro slum) in the early 1980s. Agang of young drug-dealers is preparing  feijoada, the local stew. This chicken knows that she is dead meat and tries desperately to escape. The tragi-comic scene that ensues determines the tone of  City of God, a Brazilian film by Fernando Meirelles, co-directed by Katia Lund. The fleeing animal is chased and fired at by the young hoodlums until fate leads her under the wheels of a police car. Article continues"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Aclash between the young princes of the  favela and the police is imminent and promises to be bloody. It will, however, be frozen in time, as Meirelles takes us to the 1960s and 1970s in the same locale. Based on a true account by Paulo Lins, a writer born and raised in the place that lends its name to the film,  City of God does not offer the comforting and touristy image of the Brazilian slums that Marcel Camus's 1959 film  Orfeu Negro sold to the world. This is about a nation within a nation, about the millions of  olvidados (the forgotten) that are statistically relevant, but scarcely represented on screen. Rarely has a film created such heated debate in Brazil. The country's current leader, Luiz Inacio da Silva, at the time the socialist presidential candidate, urged the then president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, to see  City of God in order to understand the extent of the urban tragedy in Brazil. Cardoso did. Arnaldo Jabor, one of Brazil's most important intellectuals, wrote that \"this is not only a film. It is an important fact, a crucial statement, a hole in our national conscience.\" After Idirected the Oscar-winning  Central Station, our small production house had the opportunity to help a few films by upcoming Brazilian directors. The decision to be part of  City of God was defined by the trust we had in Meirelles and his co-director, but also because few films could shed more light on the social apartheid of Brazil. There are more than 40,000 violent deaths a year in Brazil, more than three times the total number of deaths in Kosovo. Many of these deaths in our urban areas are the result of confrontation between drug gangs, or between dealers and the police. What  City of God achieves is the possibility to understand how we got to this chaos. In the 1960s, families of immigrants expelled from their land in the north-east of the country found an illusory refuge in the slums of the capital, Rio de Janeiro. The marginalised youth living on the fringe of society at that time had to bend to strict familial codes and rules. The drug was marijuana, which inspired a contemplative, \"romantic\" lifestyle. Gun use at the time was sporadic and the ends justified the means. In the 1970s and 1980s  everything changed. The first large drug-dealers appeared and outlaws ceased to lead a nomadic life and settled their businesses in the heart of the  favelas. These dealers began to control the communities in which they operated and created a parallel system of justice within their borders. Cocaine became the drug of choice and the .38 was traded for the AK47 and other machine guns. The death toll grew dramatically and the dealers became younger and younger. It was hell. City of God  follows several real characters, whose lives started and ended within the  favela's perimeter during these three decades. Bene, the cool marijuana dealer, Ze Pequeño, a merciless killer, and Rocket, the innocent eye, Lins's alter ego, a young black kid who manages to break the country's social and race barriers - at a price. Most of the film's actors are kids from amateur theatre groups in  favelas, or non-actors found in a year-long casting effort in these communities. The directors rehearsed them for more than six months before the shoot and improvisation was encouraged. Like other directors in Brazil, Iam used to working with non-actors, but Istill do not know how Meirelles and Lund managed to achieve such a sense of realism. Do not expect pity or redemption. There are no such things in  City of God. This is the depiction of a world where people have been forgotten for too long by the Brazilian ruling classes; a world where the state does not provide proper health or education services. In fact, the only items it provides freely are bullets. Now for the present: a time when the  olvidados got tired of being forgotten, a time of diffuse,    uncontrollable violence. \" City of God is not only a portrait of our  favelas, it is also our portrait, at 24 frames a second, our faces blurred with the faces of 10-year-old children holding machine guns. All the manifestations of our chaos become visible. This film will be seen by the whole country in terror, and Ibelieve it will cause transformations in the political arena,\" says Jabor. There were also dissonant voices in Brazil, arguing that the film gives the impression that  favelas are populated only by drug-dealers. They are not. In fact, an immense part of the Brazilian population has been the victim of this present state. This is when we realise that the chicken caught in the cross-fire at the beginning of  City of God is not only a chicken. It is the reflection of so many Brazilians trapped in an unjust country. · City of God is released on January 3. The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column, Tuesday January 14 2003 An editing error introduced the claim that the director's earlier film, Central Station, was an Oscar winner. It was nominated for best foreign film in 1999, but it did not win the Academy Award."}]}

Looking back from the year 2004, we tend to think of population growth as not such a great thing, but at the time, it was really looked on as a sign that the regime was doing its job. It enabled more people to come into the world, to have the satisfactions of being alive, and to live something vaguely approximating the Confucian good life. The Qing were able to preside over a rough tripling of the Chinese population between about 1680 and maybe 1820. This growth was achieved without a decrease in the standard of living, thanks to the increasing sophistication of the economy, to state efforts to shore up regions that couldn't produce enough food for themselves, or through such areas being able to produce some other commodity that they could trade for food. Also the population grew because of various technological changes, mostly in agriculture. The Qing were very good at taxing relatively lightly in this period while providing order and making sure that very basic survival services—such as flood control— were provided, whether by the government or by private parties encouraged by the government."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Population Growth Creates Ecological Changes"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "This population growth, in some cases, eventually became a problem. In the eighteenth century, however, it was still overwhelmingly seen as a blessing. It happened very differently in different parts of the country.

Although Chinese families did very much want sons, they were also perfectly conscious of the fact that their ability to support children was limited and that, in the long run, they didn't improve their odds by simply having the maximum number of births. And, in fact, births per woman in late imperial China are actually, on average, probably somewhat lower than in early modern Europe. There are various theories as to what kinds of birth control were practiced during this time. This is actually quite controversial and hard to reconstruct, but we do know that one way or another, they seemed to keep births down. This is very different from the traditional image of China as this land of Malthusian horror where, because they couldn't restrain their population, it was only kept in check by floods and famines. That's not the story at all. And it's again a good example of how we find the things we're trained to find. Western-trained demographers understood that in Europe, population control worked as people delayed marriage in hard times. They assumed that this was the main mechanism for fertility control available to premodern societies, so it didn't even occur to them when they looked at societies like China to think about the possibility that there might be effective birth control within marriage. Therefore, when they looked at China, they saw that access to marriage wasn't economically regulated the way it was in Europe—the average age at marriage doesn't seem to get older at hard times, women marry young anyway—and they said, \"Aha, society with no control on fertility. Therefore, if fertility is unchecked, they must have had all these enormous problems of overpopulation.\" It turns out the Chinese found ways to control fertility within marriage, which many scholars thought simply did not happen before modern chemical and mechanical contraception. Population growth was concentrated not in the advanced regions of the coast, which were running out of land and realized it, but out on the frontier."}]}

John Sayles Sony Pictures Classics The torching of a tacky float during \"Buccaneer \nDays\" opens John Sayles' Sunshine \nState . Pirates of all types abound in fictional \nPlantation Island, Fla., a small town suffering its \nconversion from a place of character and history into \none of those upscale, pastel resorts you speed past on \nI-95. The ensemble cast is split by the dividing line \nof the movie's primary concern: To sell out or not \nsell out? As it's Florida, there's plenty of sun, sea \nand palms, golfers in white slacks, weary locals in \ndenims; and, as it's John Sayles territory , our \nsympathies are meant to fall wholly on the side of the \ngrassroots townies. The heart of the film is split between two daughters. \nMarly Temple (Edie Falco) is the proprietor of a small \nmotel; after getting dumped by her golf-pro \nboyfriend, she couples up with a nicer example of one of \nthe enemy, landscape architect Jack Meadows (Timothy \nHutton). Marly longs to sell the motel her father (a \ngrizzled, speechifying Ralph Waite) has pushed on her \nas his personal dream to maintain. Aformer \"Weeki \nWachee Mermaid,\" Marly exudes a knowing \nworld-weariness, the threat of the encroaching \ndevelopers awakening in her a desire for flight. By \ncontrast, Desiree Perry (Angela Bassett) returns to \nnext-town-over Lincoln Beach (based on the actual \nAfrican-American community of American Beach, Fla., \nfounded in 1935) to wrestle with a difficult mother \nand finds herself staying to fight for the home from \nwhich she was exiled years before. As in Sayles' Passion Fish , two women, one immobilized and \nwhite, the other itinerant and black, share the \nemotional center of the film. The social ecosystem \naround these women gradually reveals itself as a net \nthat grips, either as a trap or as necessary support. In weaving his morality play, Sayles has chosen sides \nand doles out the vice and virtue in a \nstraightforward, if simplistic, manner. Those on the \nside of maintaining the old community have all the \ndignity, pathos and deeply felt issues to be played \nout; those who favor gentrification have all the \nneuroses — they are suicidal gambling addicts, \nbitter former beauty queens, wounded semi-pro athletes \nturned car salesmen, heartless local politicos, \nclownish fat golfers, trailer park Civil War \nreenactors. The decks are stacked against these folks, \nat times mere foils to Sayles' soapboxing. Francine \nPickney (Mary Steenburgen) is the town's Chamber of \nCommerce queen bee, an \narchetype dusted off from nearly every Robert Altman \nfilm, married to troubled banker Earl Pickney (Gordon \nClapp, the wimpy cop from \"NYPD Blue\"). Flash Philips \n(Tom Wright) is the ex-linebacker (he skipped out long \nago after getting a teenage Angela Bassett pregnant) \nhired as front man for a car dealership, itself the \nfront for some nameless, faceless corporate entity \nbuying up all the homes in Lincoln Beach. Miguel \nFerrer has a too-brief gem of a scene planning his \nhard-sell strategy like a wartime general. Alan King \nand Clifton James are two stogie-chomping golfers who \neventually run out of green, playing ironic Greek \nchorus to the proceedings (\"Nature! Who needs it?\") \nThese are folks, Sayles tells us with the \nsubtlety of tractors plowing through an ancient Indian \ngraveyard, neither to be pitied nor trusted; they are, \nin the end, comic relief. In a similar dramatic cul de sac, Sayles shows the \nsame love of loose ends he practiced in Limbo , by dealing us a \nbig wooden red herring of a plot point. Acting teacher \nDelia Temple, played by former NEA chairwoman Jane \nAlexander, hires a pyromaniac teen to build her a \ncoffin for her upcoming solo performance of Faulkner's \n\"As I Lay Dying.\" Beyond two minor scenes involving \nthe construction and delivery of the coffin, nothing \nelse ever comes of this (ever-unoccupied) box. This \nall seems to be Sayles at his most didactic: Is he in \nmourning for the NEA, paved over by the new anti-art \nmorality? The film's strength is quieter than Sayles' politics, \nwhich, despite his broad strokes, displays genuine, \nadult interest in the demarcation of character \n(refreshing in this summer of animated sci-fi \nspectacles ). People decide to sell out, love, forgive or remain entrenched in their need \nto believe in the American dream; and their paths \nshift, slightly yet deeply. Even the climax is a \nminor, if momentous, affair: What halts the progress \n(or destruction) is not the human endeavor on either \nside of the battle, but the ghosts of the past. The \ndead demand attention, and rising from their graves \n(literally), they stop the major conflict of Sunshine State in its tracks. The powerbrokers, the moneymen, the sharks in on the \nmoney trail, all leave town when the tractors halt. \nMen leave, Sayles seems to say; they are either \nwalking out on women or paving over things. What's \nleft in the vacuum is the film's true concern: the \nwomen who have to clean things up. Sayles may be his \nown best example of a male involved in his own drama \nwhile a quieter, more human story resolves itself on \nthe sidelines. This character-driven quality has \nalways been in Sayles' films, and bringing together \nsuch distinct concerns as presenting \nbroad social canvas, as in Matewan , and telling \nthe African-American's story \nundiluted, as in The Brother From Another Planet , \nmakes Sunshine State his \nmost comprehensive film to date. And he does it \nquietly: The prodigal daughter who has returned is \nable to stay, and the one who had been stuck at home \nhas, like all true mermaids, returned to the sea. — Stephen Bracco ( sbracco@yahoo.com )"}]}

Don 10-15-2004, 04:22 PM Why do you think you were hypnotized? You're talking about a lot of things which could have other causes. I'm not saying it didn't happen, I'd just like to know more about the events that resulted in your conclusion. haitham 10-15-2004, 04:36 PM Dear Don, Ihave to ask if a hypnotized person doesn't naturally get out of it? Iguess i can telepythically still can contact the hypnotizer this is one thing, 2ed thing the Ifeel a strange energy inside my body that moves my mecseles and orgins, it's has been 2 years by now and still not going, that might be scarey for some people but i really didn't know what happened, Ithought it is a black magic or something like that,cause it feels like it.And it lookes like the hypnotizer herself did something wrong, installing my body's energy into some doll or something like that Ido not know much about it so i am asking for help Merlin 10-15-2004, 05:53 PM Haitham, Hypnosis is a method of learning. Like when you were a child and learned quickly and easily. So no, you don't 'get out of it' Just like when you learned to walk, you don't 'get out of it', you remember how to walk. If the description you are giving is from hypnosis, then you simply need help no learn something different. Just because you learn something, doesn't make it good. But you can learn something different now. If you were hypnotised, and Idon't know if you were, then the hypnotist suggested, or taught you to feel this way. If this is true, then there is no hypnosis to break, no magic to break. There is only the need to learn to feel or be different. skip 10-16-2004, 05:36 AM Ill assess that you are indeed successfully hypnotized, to your detrement, and Iwould submit that it is irrlevent whether it was someone else, or you yourself, who has done it. Itoo am suffering from hypnotism. Iam benifitting far more than Iam suffering now, because Ihave learned how to use it, instead of just being a pawn. What do you want to do? skip Terry (existing) 10-16-2004, 10:35 AM You are receiving comments from four different and competent sources at once. Were else could you get this service, and free to boot (G)..... Now Skip has accepted that you were indeed hypnotised, and has replied based on that asumption. Iwill now suggest to you, that reading what you offered us shows no indication that hypnosis is involved, so unless you can offer more detail, Iwill take the oposite tack to Skip and say NO you were not hypnotised, and await further proof that you were. If on the other hand, you still feel that you need help via our art, you will need to consult a qualified practitioner for that, since nothing can be accomplished via the internet. Please note, whether hypnosis was involved in the past or not, it can still be of help if properly used... Terry skip 10-16-2004, 02:44 PM Terry, No doubt you would agree that this fellow has at least hypnotized himself into believing that he has been hypnotized to his detrement. From my perspective, it was immaterial whether someone else, or he himself, was the 'author' of his current trance, he is in a crummy trance, and might wish to choose another. cheers, skip haitham 10-17-2004, 05:02 AM Thanks everybody, Next, well guys How it happened Ihad a friend that eachtime she calls my name i show up, then it devolpoped that i show up eachtime that she thinks about me, then somehow i nolonger see her but in a way i feel a strange energy moving my muscels,it feels like i am attached to some strings, that are moving my body with no intention from my part, and i swear to you guys that i've been into it for 2 years by now. Is it a medical proof you need, although Iam not an expert but i went to a Foranp labo. in France withing that period, it first started,finding out that my heartbeats anylisis and brain activity are bizar as well. ok dudes, now is there a way that i can just wake up, telling myself that Iam gonna get out of it and suddenly wake up, or is there another way to do, cause my friend- the girl that i am assuming that has hypnotized me, is nolonger in touch with me, meaning either she does not want to wake me up, thinking that it is silly,probably it is not hypnotism, taking into consideration that hypnotism should not last for more than 5 min 'trans' if you loose connection with the hypnotizer! skip 10-17-2004, 08:30 AM Evidently Iam not communicating successfully my intent. Iam apparently communicating successfully, something other than my intent. Haitham, the trance, you are in, includes, among other things, the notion that you are being controlled, by someone else. To the extent that you believe this to be true, it will be true for you. And you will feel, however it is, that your imagination says, you 'ought' feel, if you were controlled. And as a human being, your mind will find 'evidence' to support your belief, and it will ignore information that points to descrepencies in your belief. Now a hypnotherapast can 'enter into your hallucination', with you, and choose to work from within it. This will give him/her instant rapport, for you will say, \"At last someone, who, unlike everyone else, truly understands my situation! They must be pretty smart!\" And for a bit, they will take you further into the hallucination, before they, hopefully, lead you 'out'. Others might take the approach of saying, \"People cannot control others using hypnosis in the way you describe. The best mind control techniques known today dont leave people feeling as you describe.\" They would say, \"You are not being controlled by this person, except in so far as you believe you are being controlled, and are acting accordingly.\" This would be true and factual information. Unfortunately you would be very likely to reject it, because you \"know\" you are being controlled, and anyone who says otherwise, is simply wrong, and their oninion is therefore invalid. Iam taking an approach that is somewhat in between the two described. Isay you are right, you are in a trance and you are being ontrolled. The only mistake, you are making, is in, \"Who is the one really doing the controlling?\" It is a mistake to believe this woman is in control of you. And she certainly isnt using hypnosis to pull your strings, assuming she is pulling your strings. Women dont need hypnosis to pull men's strings, they have something much more powerful and prevasive. :) My point is that you are the one in control. Irecognize that it doesnt feel like that to you, yet, but it is true none the less. Now, you may need the assistance of a hypnotherapast to assist you in realizing this. And to assist you in choosing the direction you want your life to go from here. BUT the bottom line is that a hypnotist can only \"assist you\", they can not do it 'for you', or 'to you'. skip Unregistered 10-17-2004, 09:49 AM Was she a friend or aquaintance?  Did she say \"Iam hypnotizing you\", or \"would you like to try this\" out? Were you physically attracted to her? When she was \"thinking\" about you and you \"showed up\" did she actually say \"Iwas just thinking of you and wanted to see you\"? Or did she say something like, \"that's funny, Iwas just thinking of you , but Inever expected you to show up\". Ithink sometimes there are \"coincidences\" or cosmic forces or whatever you want to call it, but the fact that you no longer have contact with her, is that your choice or hers? My suggestion is to visualize cutting the cord that binds you to her if that is what you want.  If you feel like a puppet, cut the strings. Iam sure many of us can relate to those relationships/acquaintances where there is a very strong urge/attraction to go see someone (whether it is mutual or not). Do what you need to do, that is in your best interest, and highest good and if you can't do it alone, find someone who can help. Good Luck haitham 10-18-2004, 02:59 PM Thanks for the help Skip, Iwill try to see a specialist, but there is noone that is really a specialist in my country and an online description might not be enough. amitabh 10-18-2004, 11:20 PM hi haitham; do catharsis, it means 'throw' that socalled energy 'out' in the air. u CAN do it vary easily, just pretent that u r throwing it outside, u can use pillow. just keep beating pillow until u 'finish' with that energy, one more thing u can do..>> GO for jogging everyday and RUN as much as u can it will HELP u very much.

Please let us know if getting rid of the magnet worked for you. EC Terry (existing) 01-19-2005, 11:24 AM Hi Steve, though Idon't ascribe to the idea that magnets in a headset can affect the brain, Ido know of research that is going on regarding the effects of magnetic waves on both electronic equipment, and on the mind. At present the investigation is being done on cows exposed to overhead power lines, and equiment in areas close to power stations. It makes sense that any therapist conversant with these activities should take precautions, but in any case, wearing headphones seems very anti social to me, since it shuts out the rest of the world, causing any person at risk to persue avoidance of others...Now it would only work for those persons so disposed, so kids who do it because they want to listen to music instead of mom, are not likely to do themselves harm (G) unless of course it results in a smart clip behind the ear, which is what Iwould have got if Ididn't pay atention to mom..... Simple Guy 01-19-2005, 08:35 PM Hi Terry, Thanks for the \"Hi Steve,\" but Ihadn't yet participated in this thread. But, it caught my attention so I'll chime in a bit. There is a commercial presently airing that is asking for volunteer subjects to test the therapeutic use of magnets for depression. Idon't know anything about the study, but hope it shows them to be safe and effective for this condition. Idid a little research on magnets prior to using one to resolve a TMJ karate injury. Iwas the subject of my own study. It seemed to work for me with this injury (using a \"north pole facing\" magnet, 12,500 gauss). Iknow that research is going on concerning \"pulsed wave\" application of magnets. Ipersonally would be cautious of some electromagnetic radiation. My understanding is that \"ham radio operators\" have increased risk factors linked to their exposure. You speak of cows. I'm glad that they are investigating their exposure to overhead power lines. Aside from my concern for the cows, it would be great to have the agriculture lobby counterbalance the influence of the power industry, in encouraging study and protective measures if and where there may be problems. (I've heard of cows being affected by low levels of electrical leakage from improperly insulated lines.) The more Ilearn about energy medicine, the more I'm inclined to believe that structure and function of the body (including the brain) are affected by magnetic fields. Jack 01-21-2005, 02:51 AM Hello Haitham, Ihave no idea whether you were hypnotised or not, whether you have remained in this mysterious 'trance', or not. What Ido know is that you seem to believe your were and are. My instinct is to ask you to get some help, possibly from a psychiatrist, but since Ido not know you or the truth of your posts, Iwill not do that. What Iwill say is that you have a belief that your life has been altered for the worse by what appears to be 'covert hypnosis', and if this 'covert hypnosis' has actually taken place then any decent hypnotherapist can help you to remove it's effects. Jack Shlomo_NLP 01-21-2005, 11:59 PM Guys, do you really think someone can get stuck in Hypnosis? Ithink it was just the most logical explanation Haitham found for himself regarding his situation... Maybe he is so skilled in entering hypnosis (like a somnabulist would) that he confuses it with getting stuck. rodimus 01-23-2005, 03:35 AM Haitam, say clearly as a command to your mind and yourself many times each day, \"nobody either in the flesh or out of it can hypnotise me. Iam free from all hypnosis. No outside influence other than Divine influence of good can affect or control me. My entire mind is protected and shuts off all unnecesary outside control. Iam in control of myself and my own mind, Iam absolutely completely freed from all hypnosis. God is my protector and only influence, and it is so!\" The author Ernest Holmes (who could heal people of cases of illness, eyesight problems, false or wrong beliefs, even insanity) cured a woman who believed she was posessed by evil spirits with that affirmation everyday. In about a week the 'spirits'(whether they were real or just subconscious parts who used to tell her nasty and demaning things) told her \"we are leaving now, we were just your subconscious parts (of guilt? etc?)\" . During the day, use that affirmation everytime to replace the thought/belief that you are being hypnotised. You can use \"Iam free from all hypnosis\" or \"(say your name in full) is freed from all hypnosis.\" Ernest Holmes believed that there is one superconscious mind which receives our thoughts, and that healing can take place with affirmation by yourself to your subconscious mind, or affirmation by other people towards you thru the superconscious mind. How is it that we can sometimes think about someone and they suddenly give us a telephone call, or we meet them in unexpected places? It is because a mental link was established in the superconscious by your subconscious minds. This can be done by suggestions, belief, or THINKING too much about the other person. Lots of lovers in this world can attest to this. Carl Jung calls this SYNCHRONICITY- a link of the subconscious. Ihad the same thing many times. When Ilike someone, Iwill always meet them unexpectedly in unexpected places. Even if Idont know them yet. Many times meet someone whom Ithink is beautiful, and Itell my own subconscious \"Iwill meet her again and again, you know how to do it\". Once, Imet this girl at least 10 times over a period of 1 month, sometimes in the cafe, or just on the street, etc. The way to stop that post-hypnotic command is to say \"This is the last time Iwill meet her\" or something like that. Don 01-24-2005, 11:24 AM How is it that we can sometimes think about someone and they suddenly give us a telephone call, or we meet them in unexpected places? It is because a mental link was established in the superconscious by your subconscious minds. This can be done by suggestions, belief, or THINKING too much about the other person. Lots of lovers in this world can attest to this. Carl Jung calls this SYNCHRONICITY- a link of the subconscious. Respectfully, Jung did not consider synchronicity to be a link of the subconscious. Rather synchronicity is simply the conscious mind putting meaning into meaningless coincidence (an acausal connecting principle). Example: Ithink about a person and the person calls me. Synchronicity: my thinking their must be some relationship between the two events rather than the fact that they are unrelated. As a psychologist, hearing about invented relationship between unrelated events from his patients was valuable to uncovering the workings of the unconscious. As such, hearing about synchronicities is as valuable to a psychologist as is hearing about dreams. The only real relationship is one of time: Aoccured before B. With synchronicity, a person who observes that Aoccured before Bposits that there must be some further relationship between Aand Bother than one of time. Positing that Acaused Band saying it is \"synchronicity\" does not really say anything, although many people believe that it does. The term, as used by Jung, merely defined the nature of an invented relationship. Today people use it as if it describes the causal relationship of events when, in fact, it does not. rodimus 01-24-2005, 06:00 PM Hi, Yes you are right, Jung came up with the term synchronicity and made it popular. Many believed he came up with a great concept, but he limited it into the confines of science- for he could not prove that the mind can create or cause coincidences (rather than just linking 2 events that are totally unrelated. Maybe they ARE related, but such is the limit of Scientific logic that whatever cannot be proven should be left aside as a question, thus never used as a possible strategy. However Quantum Physicist have agreed that the observer has the power to change the result of the experiment, just by his expectations/thoughts). \"Jung believed in astrology (http://skepdic.com/astrolgy.html), spiritualism (http://skepdic.com/spiritul.html), telepathy (http://skepdic.com/telepath.html), telekinesis (http://skepdic.com/kinesis.html), clairvoyance (http://skepdic.com/clairvoy.html) and ESP. (http://skepdic.com/esp.html)  In addition to believing in a number of occult  and paranormal notions, Jung contributed two new ones in his attempt to establish a psychology rooted in occult and pseudoscientific (http://skepdic.com/pseudosc.html) beliefs: synchronicity and the collective unconscious. \" From his beliefs, we can see where his influence and notion of synchronicity came from, however, 'coincidences' was about the ONLY thing nobody can prove to other people in a scientific experiment. We can with telekinesis, telepathy, etc, but not with 'creating coincidences'. But many philosophers after Jung used his term in a broader sense. Deepak Chopra uses 'synchronized events' to express the mind's (spiritual?) power to create opportunities by synchronizing (arranging rather than just merly linking) events. This goes further beyond Science into the Spiritual. Wayne Dwyer wrote a chapter about Syncronicity in one of his book \"You Will See It When You Believe It\". He wrote about an experience that changed him completely. He hated his father when he was young, because his father was an alchoholic and abandoned Wayne's family. He was so filled with hate and anger, and was on a journey to search for his father's whereabouts. One day he was led by some information that his father could be in a town, although he didnt know where exactly, and he rented a brand new car to go to the town, and the seat belt buckle was stuck. He spent some time trying to fix it and surprisingly he found a business card next to it on the floor of the car. It was a business card of a hotel/inn and he had a feeling he should go there. He went there and found that his father was buried on the ground of that inn. Wayne certainly used 'synchronicity' to define events that are linked, yet are not totally unrelated. Harold Sherman the famous american ESP expert, uses the same term synchronicity as thoughts creating 'coincidence'. That 2 seemingly \"unrelated\" events (how do we know its unrelated? perhaps only on a conscious logical level we think its unrelated, but the subconscious may know more than that) could be a linked cause towards what a person is trying to create/achieve in his life. He wrote about a certain famous person (Iforgot who it was), who desperately desired to get his hands on a particular newspaper articles on a certain date, certain newspaper about him. He thought about it with strong feeling for a few nights. Few days later, he was walking in downtown New York and out of the crowd, suddenly a person said to him \"Mr.x, Mr.x, Ihave something to give you. Ihave been a big fan of yours, and Ihave been collecting newspaper articles about you for many years. THis morning, i just had this feeling Ishould give these to you, Iwas on my way to mail it to you, and Isuddenly saw you! Here!\" And in his hands were the exact newspaper article, among some others. Even Richard Bandler, claimed he could use a strategy where, he can think of someone whom he wishes to be called on the telephone, and then the person would call most of the time. What Ilike about Bandler's approach is that he made it a precise strategy, with submodalities etc to make it work. Ihave used his strategy before, and his method DID make the experiment more effective. We are not talking about 100% result here everytime, you cannot take this and prove it in a scientific lab, because in the realm of mind, there are many variables influencing such things - a person's belief, expectation, correct or incorrect use of submodalities and strategy. Plus there is the time frame problem, how quickly must the 'coincidence' take place, before we say it is just pure chance? We can only, like Bandler said \"prove it to yourself or at least have an open mind to experiment with it\". Ifind that sometimes when Iwant to meet someone, it may take a few weeks before i run into them. Sometimes it takes just hours, if the person is in the same city as you are(!):)  Ibelieve that the unconscious always knows how to adjust the right suitable timing. haitham 01-30-2005, 02:37 PM >> My therapest says it is because of the magnet in my hand set.. << Interesting.....

{"file_number": "64", "plaintext": [{"tag": "p", "text": "Is There a Future for Middle East Studies? (1994 Presidential Address) Rashid Khalidi"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SOME MAY ask why Ihave chosen this ominous-sounding title. For most of us, the MESA\r\nconference is a time for socializing, browsing among the latest books and hearing papers\r\non recent research, generally in that order. It is certainly not a time for serious,\r\nintrospective, potentially boring questions like this one. In the beautiful environment of\r\nthis resort, it is even harder to focus on such unpleasant matters. In one of my last acts\r\nas President of MESA, however, Ihave decided to spoil the party, if only for a few\r\nminutes. Iwant to speak on this subject for two main reasons. The first is that it has become\r\nclear in recent years that area studies in general are in serious trouble. This means that\r\nstudy of the Middle East is likely to face difficulties. We who deal with the Middle East\r\nhave two extra disadvantages which exacerbate the general problem which affects area\r\nstudies in general. The first is the unpopularity of the region we work on in the general\r\nculture: Middle Easterners are the people many Americans love to hate, and they clearly\r\nfeel that they can do this with impunity. This can be seen from any number of films,\r\nsongs, cartoons or other products of popular culture which denigrate and insult Middle\r\nEasterners. Secondly, with some notable exceptions, we have done a poor job of reaching\r\nout from the comfortable confines of the universities and research institutes where most\r\nof us are located to try to spread knowledge of the Middle East among the general public.\r\nThis sort of outreach is the only way to combat the widespread stereotypes which\r\ncaricature Arabs, Iranians, Turks, Muslims, and Middle Easterners in general, and by and\r\nlarge we are not doing it. The second reason for my concern is more prosaic and perhaps more subjective, although\r\nit is linked in some ways to the first. It is based on my belief that we in Middle East\r\nStudies have frequently failed to reach beyond our own area of interest to make\r\nconnections with those studying other regions, including neighboring ones with\r\ncharacteristics and problems quite similar to those of the Middle East—unlike Central\r\nAsia, Africa, South Asia and the Mediterranean. At the same time, many of us have failed\r\nto remain in touch with developments within our professional disciplines in the social\r\nsciences and the humanities. This has meant that in some measure we have become provincial\r\nand over-specialized, virtually incapable of speaking to those who do not speak our own\r\nnarrow technical language. Obviously, to some degree this specialization is unavoidable,\r\nand in some respects it is desirable. But recently, when reading applications for a major\r\nfellowship competition, Iwas struck by how much narrower the submissions by applicants in\r\nthe Middle East field were by comparison with those by applicants from other fields.\r\nIndeed, to someone who was not a Middle East expert, much in these proposals was\r\nunintelligible, and as a result utterly uninteresting: it spoke to no universal concern,\r\nand shared no common language with the non-specialist reader. We are obviously convinced\r\nthat this is a fascinating field, or we would not have gone into it. And yet we seem in\r\nsome measure incapable of communicating this fascination to others not already converted\r\nto the joys of studying the Middle East. To get an idea of why area studies are in trouble, let me refer to a recent article by\r\nStanley Heginbotham, Vice President of the Social Science Research Council 1994. He argues\r\nthat the transition from the Cold War era to a new one will have a profound effect on\r\ninternational scholarship in the United States, since in the past so much of the structure\r\nand funding of this scholarship was based directly or indirectly on the requirements of\r\nthe Cold War. He adds that the implication of these changes will be a de-emphasis on\r\nspecific areas and countries, and a shift to broader themes and greater sensitivity to\r\ncontext. In particular, he notes, funders are growing dissatisfied with area studies as\r\ntraditionally defined. Area studies scholars and area studies centers will survive,\r\nHeginbotham concludes, but only by focusing less than in the past on in-depth\r\nunderstanding of the culture, history and language of a single area, and more on training\r\nthose who work within other disciplines to understand how area specifics interact with\r\ntheir own broader concerns. However one may regard this analysis, it is a cause for worry that the kinds of themes\r\nwhich we can assume will drive funding in the future -- the shift to market economies, the\r\nprocess of democratization, the growth of \"civil society,\" the resurgence of\r\nnationalism, national identities and ethnic and religious rivalries -- are all trendy\r\nones. This is not to denigrate such concerns. Indeed, some of my own current research\r\nfocuses on one of those Ijust mentioned. It is just that at least two problems can be\r\nforeseen if we become even more dependent on this sort of flavor-of-the-month interest on\r\nthe part of funding agencies. The first is that many whose research interests have no\r\ndirect relevance to current problems -- those who deal with language, culture, religion,\r\nnon-modern history and other such topics—will either have trouble obtaining support, or\r\nwill have to pretend that their work is something that it isn’t in order to get funding.\r\nAnd for those whose research does relate to current issues, this trend has the potential\r\nfor seriously distorting research priorities. At least during the Cold War, it was\r\npossible to reject outright the priorities of the policy-makers, and still find a\r\nreceptive hearing among foundations and other possible sources of research support. It may\r\nbe that this will be less possible in the future. What are other symptoms of the malaise of area studies? Aclear one is the stagnation\r\nof federal funding for international education generally. The overall federal budget for\r\neducation has not been rising in recent years, and, indeed, that part of it which we in\r\narea studies in the universities see through Title VI and other types of funding for\r\nforeign language education and National Resource Centers has been shrinking in real terms.\r\nThere seems every indication that given the environment which prevails in Washington after\r\nthe elections, this trend will accelerate. In the private sector, while Ford Foundation\r\nsupport for area studies declined long ago, there are signs today that other foundations\r\nwhich are more recent supporters of this field, such as the Mellon and MacArthur\r\nFoundations, while still deeply interested in international studies, are moving away from\r\n“area studies, as they are traditionally defined,” to quote a recent letter from\r\nthe Vice- President of the Mellon Foundation. Given these facts about money for area studies drying up, and the particular\r\nunpopularity of the Middle East in society at large, we are certainly not doing ourselves\r\nany favors by being holier-than-thou about outreach to the general community. This\r\nattitude is not restricted to the Middle East field. Asenior academic in a position of\r\nresponsibility specializing in an area adjacent to the Middle East at a prestigious\r\ninstitution which shall remain unnamed said at a recent meeting Iattended that the only\r\nreason we do outreach is because it is a priority in the federal guidelines for National\r\nResource Centers. This is a short-sighted and ultimately self-defeating point of view, not only because\r\nDepartment of Education officials are perfectly capable of telling when we are faking it\r\nas far as outreach is concerned and because this is therefore harmful to our relationship\r\nwith them. More importantly, it is reminiscent of an earlier era in education, when those\r\nin academia could assume that what they did was valued by society, and that society would\r\nsupport them, if not lavishly, then at least comfortably, without their having to justify\r\ntheir existence. If any of you are still in any doubt that these days are gone for good,\r\nlook around you: except for certain types of professional training, this society does not\r\nappear to value education. Look at the products of our public schools, and what they have\r\nbeen taught when they come to us as undergraduates; look at school teachers salaries, or\r\nyour own salaries, and compare them to the salaries of newly minted MBA s or lawyers; look\r\nfinally at the financial crisis facing both public and private universities. This is a\r\nsociety which has been disinvesting in education for well over a decade; it is a society\r\nwhich does not find the value of what most of us do in the universities to be\r\nself-evident. If we want society to continue to pay for what we do, we have to be much\r\nmore convincing in arguing publicly about how valuable it is. Given this situation, how important is it for us to do outreach? Iwould submit that it\r\nis crucial. Students who come to us from high school—and here Iam talking of students\r\narriving at both private universities and small and large public ones— have on average\r\nno usable knowledge of a foreign language, know little or no geography, and have only the\r\nspottiest understanding of history, culture, politics and economics. In this situation, we\r\nin area studies or international studies generally are at a disadvantage. Obviously,\r\noutreach by itself cannot change the priorities of a nation whose best high schools cannot\r\nproduce graduates capable of speaking a foreign language passably. Ilearned this recently\r\nwhen Iwas a member of a committee which looked at the language qualifications with which\r\nfreshmen arrive at the University of Chicago. Most of them know nothing useful as far as\r\nlanguages go. Most had one or two years of a European language, which they could not use\r\nfor any practical purpose. This is not to speak of their ability to use English!\r\nNevertheless, active and committed outreach does produce results, as is shown by follow-up\r\nwith schools where teacher outreach has been done: more students become interested in\r\nlanguages, international studies and area studies. And since we operate under the\r\nparticular disadvantages of the hostility to the Middle East in the general culture which\r\nImentioned earlier, we must work all the harder at it: even the prospects of peace\r\nbetween the Arab states and Israel will not suffice to erase this hostility, for although\r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict probably contributed to enhancing it, this hostility antedates\r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict by centuries. Let me move on to my second reason for concern regarding the future of Middle East\r\nstudies, our lack of connections to the study of other regions and the related problem of\r\nour lack of involvement with the professional disciplines. There are many benefits to be\r\ngained from connections with the study of other regions. Among them is the possibility of\r\nlearning about sophisticated approaches which may be of benefit to us, such as the\r\nSubaltern school and its critics in South Asian historiography, or the mutually beneficial\r\ninteraction between historians and anthropologists in African studies, or the shared\r\nattention to the intertwining between political economy, history and culture in Latin\r\nAmerican studies. These are only examples, and more could be offered, such as the\r\ninteresting way in which questions of gender, or identity or class are being treated in\r\nwork being done in several other regions. It is my strong impression that connections with\r\nother areas would benefit Middle East studies by bringing in some fresh ideas to what\r\nremains a rather cloistered preserve and at the same time would help us to understand the\r\nuniversal nature of at least some of the problems we study, which in itself is a benefit\r\nin a field which is perhaps too enamored of its own specificity. As for connections with the disciplines, here there are several grave problems in my\r\nopinion, some of which we can little control, and some which we could certainly deal with\r\nwere we to choose to do so. What we cannot perhaps do anything about is the disturbing\r\ntendency of some of the social sciences to ignore area studies in general and Middle East\r\nstudies in particular in their new appointments and in the way they think of their fields.\r\nSome in the social sciences talk disparagingly of area studies as no more than\r\n“real\r\nestate studies,” and some actively discourage the study of languages by their\r\nstudents, while still others argue that there is a dearth of theoretically interesting\r\nwork in the Middle East field. Whatever we may think of such attitudes, our options are\r\nlimited in face of the rejection by some disciplines of the study of the Middle East,\r\nunless we can show them that work of interest to the central concerns of these disciplines\r\nis being done in the Middle East field. This brings me to my main point, those things which we do control. Dealing with them\r\nwill not be an easy matter: it involves seeing what we do as part of the larger enterprise\r\nof the humanities and the social sciences, and more specifically as part of the individual\r\ndisciplines which make them up, not as a special, arcane branch of knowledge known as\r\nMiddle East studies, or Near East studies, or Oriental studies or whatever. Certainly\r\nparticular language training is necessary to study the Middle East, and of course this\r\nregion has a specific cultural and religious and historical make-up. But at base what we\r\nare studying is just one branch of human history, or human literature or human sociology,\r\nor whatever, and not a discipline in and of itself with its own language and its own\r\nrituals. Iexaggerate a bit, but sometimes that is what Ithink Iam listening to when we\r\ntalk to one another professionally. Let me put the same point differently for greater emphasis. If we do not get out of the\r\nhabit of seeing ourselves in this way, that is to say as almost a separate discipline, we\r\nare fated to go the way of the dodo and the dinosaur. Middle East studies is not a\r\nseparate discipline: like the term \"the Middle East\" itself, \"Middle East\r\nstudies\" is a recent and artificial construct whose underpinnings are currently\r\nslowly eroding for reasons which Ihave alluded to, and which are beyond our control.\r\nNevertheless, our future lies in being part of the departments of comparative literature,\r\npolitical science, history, or whatever and not in remaining in a Middle Eastern ghetto.\r\nIt may be argued, with some reasons, that many of these disciplines are constructs as\r\nartificial as Middle East studies; but they have either a longer pedigree, or more\r\npowerful institutional support, and most of them can legitimately claim to be more\r\nuniversal. That, in any case is where our future lies: in trying, for example, to bring an\r\nunderstanding of a society other than American society into the discipline of sociology as\r\nit is taught in this country, or understanding Middle Eastern literatures in terms of\r\nother world literatures, or doing whatever we do within the context of the discipline to\r\nwhich we rightly belong. This is necessary if we want non-specialists to obtain the benefit of what can be\r\nlearned from studying the Middle East. But it is also necessary to save us from\r\nstagnation, provincialism and, ultimately, extinction. The answer to the rhetorical\r\nquestion of my title is therefore ambiguous. If we fail to get out of our rut, fail to\r\naddress the general public, fail to address other areas, and fail to address our own\r\ndisciplines, we are doomed to increasing marginalization, and there is no future for\r\nMiddle East studies. If we fail, our marginalization will spread beyond the current level\r\nof policy and public discourse. At that level today, we who actually know something about\r\nthe Middle East, and have been there, and know the languages, are largely ignored, while\r\nill-informed sensationalists like Steven Emerson and Robert D. Kaplan hog the headlines\r\nand grace the podiums of think-tanks and lecture halls. If we fail, our marginalization\r\nwill go beyond this, and will extend into our own cherished preserve of academia, where\r\nold and sometimes distinguished units with names like the Departments of Near East\r\nStudies, Oriental Studies, Middle East Languages and Cultures and Near East Languages and\r\nCivilizations are being eyed with increasing eagerness by budget-conscious deans wielding\r\nlarge axes and planning big cuts. Icannot, of course, promise that we will escape the deans with their axes, any more\r\nthan will our compatriots in the academy facing identical challenges. If, however, we can\r\ndo all these things, most notably learn to speak the languages of our disciplines, as well\r\nas the language of ordinary people, we will at least be able to resist and hopefully to\r\nreverse our intellectual marginalization, both within the universities and without. There are peculiar things happening in some of the disciplines, and heaven knows some\r\nof these fads and trends are far better resisted than capitulated to. But there are\r\nexciting and revolutionary things happening as well in some disciplines, things which by\r\nand large do not penetrate the corridors of our Middle East departments and centers,\r\nalthough many similar units covering other regions have not missed them. In any case, we\r\nshould be part of the internal discourse within the disciplines whereby these new ideas\r\nare resisted or accepted, instead of standing outside, in splendid isolation, turning up\r\nour noses at such ideas. In other words, it is time for people studying the Middle East to\r\npartake of some of the excitement which characterizes many of their respective\r\ndisciplines, and to realize that the future of the field is ultimately there. While nothing is sure in this world, if we do all these things, Iwould venture to\r\nguess that Middle East studies does have a future. In the end, of course, it is up to us,\r\nteachers, students and others interested in this field, to determine which way it will go.\r\nThe future of Middle East studies is in our hands. Let us all hope that we decide wisely\r\nwhat to do with it. References. Heginbotham, Stanley J., “Rethinking International Scholarship,” Items 48(2-3):\r\n33-40, 1994."}]}

In the\r\nprocess, he began looking at the other distributions to see how they\r\nhandle security updates, and he was not at all happy with what he\r\nfound.  In today's editorial, he shares his concerns and explains why\r\nit matters to you even if you do all your security monitoring for\r\nyourself. Copyright notice: All reader-contributed material on freshmeat.net \r\n          is the property and responsibility of its author; for reprint rights, please contact the author\r\n          directly. As a professional Unix systems administrator, I'm concerned about\r\nsystem security. Keeping unauthorized users off my systems is simply\r\npart of my job; doing this requires vigilance in the form of\r\nmonitoring performance, reading logs, and keeping patches up-to-date.\r\nFor me, security is about security; it's about keeping my users'\r\nprojects safe and keeping them comfortable despite a full-time\r\nconnection to the Internet. As Lead Coordinator of the\r\nBastille Linux Project , a hardening script for Red Hat Linux, Ithought my job was to make Linux more secure so beginning users could\r\neasily keep their boxes secure. Often, new Linux users have no\r\nexperience as system administrators or often even any experience with\r\nUnix. Ithought the best way to tackle the problem was to make it easy\r\nto do the right thing. Recently, I've been asked lots of questions about Linux system\r\nsecurity by reporters. Often, I'm put on the defensive right away: Does\r\nLinux have a security problem? Why is Linux less secure than other\r\noperating systems? Is open-source software inherently less secure than\r\ncommercial systems? Iusually begin by explaining that more holes are reported in\r\nopen-source software before they're exploited, and that the\r\nnumber of actually-exploited holes is no greater -- perhaps even less --\r\nthan commercial software. Iexplain that one reason there are so many\r\nbreak-ins into Linux systems is that there are so many Linux systems on\r\nthe Internet, and Iexplain that Linux can be as secure as any other\r\noperating system. But Linux does have a security problem. It's not a universal problem,\r\nbut look at the following list of security Web sites, mailing lists, and\r\nupdate tools for some common Linux distributions: Red Hat Linux http://www.redhat.com/support/errata redhat-watch-list-request@redhat.com Update Agent available only to purchasers of Red Hat 6.1 Debian http://www.debian.org/security debian-security-announce-REQUEST@lists.debian.org apt-get update SuSE http://www.suse.de/security suse-security-announce-subscribe@suse.com No official tool for auto updates  -- AutoRPM works on both\r\nSuSE and Red Hat.

Some may be aimed at relatively expert users, but I'm\r\na fairly advanced user myself, and Istill expect that my software\r\ndistributor is watching out for security at least minimally. That's\r\none of the reasons Idon't roll my own distribution. Of the eight common distributions Icould think of, three have\r\nnothing whatsoever to do with security, and at least one of the\r\nothers didn't seem to be doing anything useful. No wonder Linux has a\r\nsecurity problem: while those four distributions have probably less\r\nthan a quarter of the Linux market, they tend to be high-profile\r\ndistributions which garner more than their share of media coverage. These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they're\r\ndamaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Every\r\ntime I'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, Ihave to\r\nconsider Caldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before Ican answer.\r\nThese distributions' total lack of concern with security is an\r\nembarrassment to the entire Linux and Open-Source communities. Because of these distributions, I'm forced to admit to reporters\r\nthat many Linux installations are insecure, and there's little the\r\naverage user can do about it without dedicating an inordinate amount of\r\ntime to security work. Most users aren't paid to worry about security,\r\nas Iam. For many, computing may be only a small part of their work.\r\nThese people can't rightly be asked to read Bugtraq; they've got work to\r\ndo. If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems\r\nwouldn't be cracked. On the university campus where Iwork, systems have\r\nbeen exploited using the automount daemon bug which is more than a year\r\nold, and which has been patched nearly that long. Being a professional,\r\nIknow that they shouldn't even be running it, because Iknow that\r\nthey're not using it. But Ican't expect them to know, and Ican't even\r\nfix it myself: Ididn't know that some of these machines existed\r\nuntil Ifound out that they'd been hacked. Asking these users to read a\r\nsingle, low-volume, vendor-specific mailing list is a pretty good\r\nsolution -- when those lists exist. Experienced users should abandon Linux distributions which don't\r\nprovide security fixes in a timely manner and post that information to a\r\nWeb site, a mailing list, or both. They should abandon these\r\ndistributions not because they necessarily need the security notices\r\nfor themselves, but because these distributions are ruining Linux's\r\nimage not only with novice users, but with the reporters and editors who\r\nshape managers' opinions on whether Linux is a viable solution. You may claim that you're a hobbyist, and you couldn't care less if\r\nbusinesses use Linux; that's your right, certainly. However, you lose\r\nnothing when businesses use Linux, you lose nothing when security\r\nupdates are made available and publicized, and you gain nothing when\r\nbusinesses reject Linux because some vendor couldn't be bothered to\r\npackage up an already publicly-available solution to a security\r\nhole. The rest of us do lose.  It hurts our professional reputations when\r\nwe stand behind a piece of software with frequent and\r\nhighly-publicized security lapses.  It wastes our time, tracking down\r\nhacked user machines for which we're not responsible and rebuilding\r\nthem from the ground up.  It wastes our money, when businesses and\r\ngovernment agencies buy more expensive hardware and software for the\r\nillusion of security. Solving this problem isn't difficult or time consuming; simply pick\r\ndistributions which express a basic level of concern for security\r\nissues, and let vendors know -- at trade shows, in e-mail, in letters\r\nto the editor of your favorite publication -- that security isn't just\r\nabout security.  It's about preserving our reputation for quality, and\r\nit's about saving time and money.

If there's a problem, an \"engine problem\"\nindicator lights up on the dashboard. You get in your Geo, put the key in the ignition, turn it on, put the\ngearshift in Drive, step on the gas, and go.  If there's a problem, a\n\"General Fault\" message pops up on the screen. Linux Vehicle: You turn on your machine, it boots Linux/BSD/Solaris/FooNIX, you watch\nthe startup messages for any errors, you type in your login and password,\nyou get a shell prompt, maybe you type \"startx\" to get a nice GUI.  You\nnow have your choice of hudreds of commands, tools, utilities, compilers,\neditors, and apps to bring to bear on the problem at hand.  If there's a\nproblem, a core file and a ton of log messages are spewed out to tell the\nuser exactly what part broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise\nthe stability of the rest of the system. You step out on the flight line, do a thorough walkaround of your F-22\nchecking for any potential problems, hop in the cockpit, enter your\nauthentication code, crank up the turbines, taxi out to the end of the\nrunway, get clearance from the tower, and take off.  You now have your\nchoice of hundreds of possible maneuvers, and a wide array of avionics,\nECM, and weaponry to bring to bear on the problem at hand.  If there's a\nproblem, diagnostic information gets spewed out at the pilot to tell him\nexactly what part broke, and whether or not it's going to compromise the\nairworthiness of the aircraft. The driver of the Geo doesn't need to know how the engine works, or how to\nrepair it, in order to get from point Ato poing B.  That's what the\nmechanic is for.  If there's a problem, an \"engine problem\" indicator\nlights up on the dashboard. Likewise, the driver of the F-22 doesn't need to know how the radar,\navionics, and engine work, or how to repair them, in order to shoot down\nthe other guy.  That's what the ground crew is for. The persond driving F-22, however, must have a great deal more knowledge\nof and competence in the physics involved in maneuvering the vehicle than\nthe driver of the Geo. The \"driver\" of the Windows box doesn't need to know how files are stored\non disk, or how an interrupt vector tells the CPU that the sound card\nwants some attention.  He does need to know enough to use the Start->Shut\nDown menu item, instead of just turning off the power.  He should know enough not to run any .exe files or open any word files that haven't\nbeen virus scanned. The \"driver\" of the Linux box doesn't need to know what an inode is, or\nhow System V IPC works.  He does need to know how to log on and off\nproperly, and how to read basic error messages that show up on the\nconsole, how to use the shutdown command. He should know the basics\nof configuring and compiling a kernel, and locking down inetd.conf and the\nrc.* files. In a corporate environment, most of the more complicated stuff for either\nsystem is handled by the IT staff.  They take care of things like\nfirewalls at the edge of the corporate network, and shutting off telnet,\nftp, rpc, and other such things on machines that don't need them up. At home, it's a different story.  Someone using a computer at home is most\nlikely either dialing a modem in to an ISP, or connecting full time with an\nISDN or DSL link. (Unless they're a total geek, and have set up their own\n10.0.0.0 network behind a dedicated NAT-ing/Firewalling box ...) Sadly, most people don't realize the risk they're putting themselves at by\ndoing this without installing and configuring security tools.  Even a\nsimple thing like NukeNabber for Windows can help avert a system\ncompromise, if the user is aware enough to yank the phone line out of the\nwall when a port scan is detected by it.  Ihave little sympathy for\npeople who's machines get compromised due to their own ignorance and\nincompetence. Anyone running a computer that's attatched to the\n'net needs to take the time to learn how to secure it. (By \"running\" Imean being the person responsible for it's maintenance, as in an IT person\nfor a corporation, or the owner/user of a home machine.) That's just the way it is. If you want Linux for the masses, it must\nbe idiot proof. There's no such thing. If no distro makes the idiot proof LAN workstation, then each network\r\n   sys admin will have to cook up their own.

My premise is that every computer user should be responsible for understanding basic computer security.  The state of the general public's computer literacy is,\nIMNERHO, simply pathetic!

Idon't see Linux as a hobbyist's toy, Isee it as a tool that I'd like to be\nable to use at work (much as Mr. Lasser was talking about). In a LAN\nsetting, not everyone is a sysadmin, and in fact, that could never work.\nPeople can be perfectly productive UNIX users without understanding\nanything about inetd.conf.

My message is only that multiple inetd.conf files should be included with\nevery distribution, and the user should have the opportunity to choose\nfrom several options: Secure: for single users - no open ports Medium: for remote-admin nodes - telnet, ssh, just the 'portant stuff Insecure: for the hacker who will do it all themself anyways :) Ifind it discontenting that distributions include soooo many services on\nby default... but thats just me... and I'm just the user digitalunity aka digitalun aka mike the hacker next door bud - bag, can, bottle, keg. itsallgood.

By default, remote access services are disabled until the admin\nexplicitly goes into inetd.conf and enables them. Slimy is correct in saying that Imiss the point of the main article in my\nprevious post.  Iwasn't aiming for it.  Iintended the post in context\nwith the other replies talking about how there should be a distro that is\n\"secure\" out of the box.  (Iguess Imissed that by a hair, too ;) The simple truth remains that there just is no such thing.  The security\nof any system, no matter what OS it is running, is a function of the\ncluefulness of the admin.  Awell run Linux box will be more secure than a\npoorly run OpenBSD install.  Awell run NT server will be more secure that\na shoddily maintained Solaris 7 box. Of course, the only way to have a system that is completely secure from\nbeing hacked on the 'net, is not to have it on the 'net at all.

Clearly, one must learn Unix if one expects to administer a Linux\nmachine.  And that includes home users.  But still, most Linux\nDistributions that Ihave run across, Slackware and Debian included, make\nassuptions about system installations that are not, from a security\nstandpoint, logical.   For example, installing a telnetd server by default\nis probably not a good idea.  Having it installed and configured to accept\nremote connections by default is horrific!  Yet this was the case when Iinstalled Debian 2.1.  Debian 2.2 (Potato) is a little smarter than this,\nbut thats not the official release (yet). As anyone who has delt with security issues for some time will tell\nyou: the best security policy you can adopt is \"that which is not\nexplicitly allowed is denied\".  More distributions need to take this into\naccount. If Iwant a telnet server, Iwill ask for it.  And when Iinstall it,\nIwould expect that: at best, it would not aceept connections from\nanywhere until Itold it otherwise; at worst, it would accept local\nconnections only, until Itold it otherwise. [reply] [top] [ » ] Linux, security, and the Common Man(tm) by RichD - Jan 10th 2000 13:17:07 Linux is a UNIX style operating system.  UNIX was not originally intended\nfor the \"casual\" or \"home\" user ... they just didn't exist in 1969. Linux, the BSDs, and any UNIX flavor, for that matter, requires the\nuser to have a given level of cluefulness.  IMNERHO, this is a Good Thing.\n The plain, simple, ugly truth is that if you don't know what inetd.conf is\nfor, if you don't know where your startup scripts are and how to edit them,\nif you don't know how to set up your anonymous FTP server correctly, etc.\netc. etc. ... then *you* *should* *NOT* *be* *using* *UNIX*!!!!! The flip side of that is that anyone can easily obtain the\ndocumentation and learn how to do all of these things, as well as all the\nother tasks required to keep a UNIX system up and running properly.  This\nhas the effect (or at least the potential) of raising the computer\nliteracy level of the general public. Sadly, most people think of their computer the same way they think\nabout their television set, their microwave, and their car.  The way Isee\nit, computers are actually more akin to power tools -- if you don't read\nthe instructions and/or get proper training in their use, you're gonna get\nhurt. There are a few simple truths about the Internet as it stands today\nthat many, if not most, people overlook: 1- The Internet, like Downtown(tm), is *NOT* a safe place.  Anyone who\nattatches a computer or a network to the Internet is placing themselves at\nrisk.  There are malicious people out there who want to steal your\ninformation, just like there are malicious people out there who want to\nsteal your wallet.  There are Script Kiddies out there who want to deface\nyour website, just as there are Junior Gangbangers out there who want to\ntag your house/car/fence/wall/place of business. 2- You gotta cover your own ass.  Ultimately, your computer's safety\nis your responsibility, just like your personal safety is your own\nresponsibility.  Companies have sysadmins who get paid to keep the network\nsecure.  They also have security guards and alarm systems and such to keep\nthe physical premeses physically secured.  At home, you have locks on your\ndoors, and perhaps an alarm system, to help keep intruders out of your\nhome.  Isay \"help\" because the fact remains that if someone really wants\nto break into your house, they will, alarm system notwithstanding.  The\nsame is true for computers on the 'net.  If someone *really* wants to get\nin, they will.  There are, however measures that can be taken to make it\nmuch more difficult. Yes, there are people out there who are trying to help look out for\neverybody's safety, just like there are police patrolling the streets\nlooking out for everyones safety ... and they're about as effective.  The\nfact remains that if you don't know how to spot a potential mugger, and if\nyou don't bother learning basic personal safety practices (like scanning\nthe area for potential baddies before unlocking your car door or\napproaching your home, or being able to spot the scratches on the lock and\ndoor frame that indicate forced entry), you're much more likely to get\nmugged than the person who *has* bothered to learn these things. Similarly, if you don't bother learning basic computer safety\npractices (like editing inetd.conf, and configuring firewalling), you're\nmuch more likely to get cracked that the person who *has* learned these\nthings. It doesn't take much.  Anyone who has any semblance of intelligence\nhigher that that of an earthworm can figure out how to edit their\ninetd.conf file to turn off unecessary daemons.  Configuring IPChains is a\npiece of cake, if you bother to read the FAQ and HOWTO. Ihave no sympathy for anyone who whines about how hard it is to set\nup a Linux/BSD/UNIX system.  \"But Windows just works\" is the party line\n... primarily because most people never actually *do* a Windows install. \nThey buy computers from the local consumer electronics store, which come\nwith Windows preinstalled (by someone who gets paid to install Windows on\ndozens or hundreds of computers a day), and have no clue how insecure they\nare when they hit that Dialup Networking button to go surfing the net. At least Linux and the other freeware Unices *have* easily accessible\nmechanisms like inetd.conf, and firewalling tools like IPChains that allow\nthem to be made more secure.  At least the users of these systems know (or\nshould know) that there are security issues to be addressed. Most Windows users are blissfully unaware that they are wide open to\nmany attacks that can crash their machines, and many more attacks that\ntake advantage of their ignorance to use email attatchments, JavaScript,\nActiveX, and other such methods to install backdoors into their systems. \nFurthermore, most Windows users have no simple method to block such\nattacks against their home box that they use to dial directly into the\n'net. When these users load Linux, without taking the time to learn about\nthe issues involved, they remain just as ignorant of their security\nsituation as they were when they were running Windows. People take the time to attend self defense and \"street smarts\"\nseminars, and martial arts classes to learn how to protect themselves in\nthe Real World(tm).  They watch the news to find out if there is a serial\nrapist in town this week.  They lock their doors and windows at night, and\nturn on the alarm system to keep the burglers out. Is it really to much to expect people to take the time to learn the\nrelatively simple techniques (like editing out unneeded daemons from\ninetd.conf and their startup scripts, and configuring firewalling like\nIPChains) that will lock down their Linux box to keep the Script Kiddies\nout?

This is true for the most part, but if\nwe all look at security and pay attention to it rather than sloughing it\noff, it doesn't have to be a myth.

[reply] [top] [ » ] Let's get the facts straight by Olaf Kirch - Jan 10th 2000 12:08:03 Being the person at Caldera who's responsible for security issues, Ifelt\nnot just a little insulted by your claim that Caldera is one of the\ndistributions that doesn't to anything about security. You write, in trying to apologize for your unfair treatment of Slackware:\n``In the old days [...] Slackware had huge numbers of security holes.''\nThis sentence enforces my suspicion that your article is based much more\non dated stereotypes than real understading of what goes on in the Linux\nsecurity area. If you go back to some time around 95, Igrant you that Linux\r\ndistributions used to resemble leaky buckets more than a secure OS. This,\nand the fact that Linux was ignored both by CERT and (to a large degree)\nby bugtraq as well lead to the establishment of various Linux security\nresources--such as a the linux-security list. Since then, most Linux distributors, including Caldera, have started to\nput a lot more emphasis on security. There is even a certain\r\namount of information sharing and coordination concerning security issues\namong Linux distributors. Ihave personally audited most if not all setuid applications and a\r\nnumber of network servers shipped with OpenLinux. Linux as a\r\nwhole has profited from this. And we're not the only Linux vendor\r\ntrying to address security problems proactively. Working in the security area myself Ican on the other hand understand\nyour apparent frustration. Making an operating system more secure is an\nuphill battle you cannot win. Distributors make mistakes in integrating\nsoftware with their product (or they make choices you consider a mistake).\nProgrammers insist on putting the same bugs into their programs over and\nover again (do a grep strcpy over the pine sources one day). Many users\nexpect things to \"just work\" and don't take security serious until they\nget hacked. However don't blame distribution maintainers for a problem that has many\nmore facets--especially if your assignment of blame is based on sloppy\nresearch. On the overall scale, Linux security has improved a lot over the past few\nyears--and while Iagree that there's a long way to go, progress will\ndepend at least as much on creating more secure software in the first\nplace as on the vendors' timely delivery of patches.

[reply] [top] [ » ] Another Slack Flame? by KL Davis - Jan 9th 2000 09:42:16 Well... Iread this a few hours ago, but thought it best to hold any comments\nfor awhile -- Awhile has passed. First, Ido not blame Mr. Lasser for this article.  Having experience\nas an editor of a small, international law enforcement journal... Iknow\nthat the old adage \"Don't shoot me, I'm just the messenger\" holds no water\nin the journalism business.  Mr. Covey... shame now, did we not learn at\nleast one thing from the cinema classic \"Real Genius\"?  \"Never forget to\ncheck your references!\"  (Ithink the kids still like it when I \"get down\"\nverbally). Mr Lasser, Inote that you have made an attempt, albeit feeble, but\nwhat appears to be an attempt non the less at saying you are sorry?  If\nthis was an apology... then I, as a card carrying Slacker, accept -- Thank\nyou. Now if Imay make a comment or two?  Ido not claim to know even a\nfraction of what you, MR. Lasser, know about computer security.  Ionly\nstarted *tinkering* with computers in 1984 --  The majority of my security\nexperience is more with MP5s than MD5.  But, as anyone who knows me (or has\nhad the misfortune of finding my web site) knows, Ihave made a real\ndedication towards network security. Iseem to have taken a different, Ilike to think more practical,\napproach to finding what flavor of Linux Iwould use for my firewall and\nsecure OS base.  Rather than which distro was the most popular and had the\nmost support, Ichose the one that (IMO) needed the least work: Slackware! \nBut that is not why Iam writing, Ihope to offer a simple explanation that\nseems too often missed -- Or, misunderstood.  Anyway, this is what Ihave\npicked up in the last couple of decades... The notion that anyone can completely protect something is silly...\nnoble, but silly.  There is no security panacea -- and look closely at\nthose who claim to have it, odds are there little wagons have the words\n\"snake oil\" freshly painted over  on the sides.  It is this sort of\nthinking that drives a company to spend $180,000.00 on a high-tech,\nlaminated steel door - mounted in hardened and reinforced concrete & steel\nframe and casement - featuring hinges and locksets made of solid\nunobtanium!  Then put that door between two windows made of genuine\nglass? This is the same rational that has System Administrators walking\naround touting their new mega buck, AI powered, Super-Cyber-Crypt-Keeper\nSoftware... while EVERY terminal (even the one that customers can use in\nthe lobby) has a functional floppy drive! (yes, Ihave seen this). Security (my definition) is a measure of time -- a double ended time\nline, separated in the middle by an event... a breach or loss (X).  One\nthe left side of that event is the time leading up to it, the time before\nit happens -- not if, rather when.  To the right of the event, is the time\nit will take to recover from the event -- to fully negate the loss. |-------------------------------(X)-----------| Security is any effort that moves the event (X) further to the right,\nin fact all effort should be to move the event as far as possible to the\nright -- in a perfect world, a security compromise is only a threat until\nit is discovered, after action and contingency plans are already tested\nand in place... negation is immediate. Sorry, Ihave rambled on for far too long now... Ido respect you and\nyour efforts with the Bastille project, thanks!  And BTW, there is one\nfool proof plan for securing something, used every day actually, the\nGovernment has printed several manuals on how to do it even! ... Total\nDestruction. KLD a.k.a Nanux [reply] [top] [ » ] a secure distribution by Phil Howard - Jan 9th 2000 04:15:04 Different distributions try to address different issues as seen by\ndifferent kinds of users, all with different experiences and different\ngoals.  The very fact we have so many distributions attest to the\ndiversity of the user base.  This is something that Linux distributions\n(and their BSD cousins) have over that commercial OS we've heard about. One size does NOT fit all.  It never did, and it never will.  What a\nhacker needs, or what a hobbyist needs, or what a web site needs, or what\na system administrator needs, or what an office manager needs, or what a\nsalesman needs ... all these things are different. Ican certainly says from experience as a system administrator that\nthe most secure systems are the result of a skilled administrator taking\nthe time to get all the necessary information (and keep up to date so you\nare a moving target) and apply all the necessary upgrades and\nconfigurations.  However, a system administrator is not going to be\nsetting up most machines anymore as Linux begins to bump out that other OS\nfrom the desktop.  Indeed, many server situations fall into that arena.  If\nIwere to set up and configure a Linux desktop for someone, there are a LOT\nof things I'd be doing to the system AFTER installing the distribution,\nwith security changes being in the lead position, and other things like\nmanageability being next (for example, cleanup scripts that ensure logs\ndon't fill up /var). There are a lot of things a distribution could do to make life HELL\nfor a system administrator, but making EVERYTHING be defaulted to turned\nOFF is not one of them.  I've used both Slackware and Redhat and Ihave to\ndo a lot to both (more to Redhat but still a significant amount to\nSlackware) to make them secure.  Idon't clean inetd.conf ... Ishut off\ninetd itself ... on many systems.  Every distribution should leave every\nservice that could listen on a port or pipe turned off, even lpd.  During\ninstall, and at any time later, there can be the option to enable specific\nservices.  But unless those actions are taken, the services should be\ninstalled in such a way they are not running until properly turned on. This would be to the best benefit of end users who have little or no\ntime to keep themselves security aware, and as a system administrator, I'd\nmuch rather have to go turn things on than have to turn them off.  It would\nnot break any distribution to do it this way. [reply] [top] [ » ] Oh my. by Daniel T. Chen - Jan 9th 2000 04:10:57 Jon Lasser brings up some very good points, and his editorial is\nwell-suited to the Linux community.  As one of several student Unix\nsysadmins in the computer science department, Ihave to deal with the same\ntypes of things he does.  One of the reasons we've opted not to go with\nLinux 100% but instead concentrated on IRIX and Solaris is because (1) we\nfeel IRIX has a proven track record of being more stable and secure than\nLinux; and (2) because Solaris provides a proven environment in which our\nCS students can code.  This does not prevent many attempts to exploit our\nmachines, however.  On the average, Ispend nearly twenty minutes *per\nhour* scrounging through logs and checking stats to ensure that my fellow\nstudents are safe at what they do best (coding).\r\n\r\nThis does not come at an easy price.  Since I'm only one of a few\nsecurity-minded student sysadmins, Ihave to make sure that my coworkers\nare kept current on the latest exploits, security advisories and fixes,\netc.\r\n\r\n[Imean this as no offense to anyone, but I've also noticed that the irc\nnetwork EFNet seems to split a lot more often now that Linux ircds have\npopped up.  Things weren't this way when they stuck to *BSD daemons. \n*sigh*]\r\n\r\nIsimply wish we could all just listen to what Jon Lasser was trying to\npoint out instead of nitpicking over the details of whether or not a\nparticular distribution has security lists/pages/whatnot.

It\r\ncertainly wasn't intended to be that.\" Simple Answer: \"These distributions aren't just putting their users at risk; they're\ndamaging Linux's credibility and its image in the marketplace. Every time\nI'm asked by a reporter why Linux is so insecure, Ihave to consider\nCaldera, Corel, Turbo Linux, and Slackware before Ican answer.

They should abandon these distributions not\nbecause they necessarily need the security notices for themselves, but\nbecause these distributions are ruining Linux's image not only with novice\nusers, but with the reporters and editors who shape managers' opinions on\nwhether Linux is a viable solution.\" [ Further Ifound this funny \"If only systems were kept up to patch, huge numbers of systems wouldn't\nbe cracked.

Iam not going to say Slackware is the most secure Linux, but\nthat is only because Iagree with the comment about the administrators\nbeing the security. As far as getting a distribution secure in a short\namound of time, Slackware is darn good. Recently a RedHat loving (Once Slackware despising) friend of my'n was\namazed at how easy slackware is to configure ( without all the junk in the\nway ) and has since changed distributions. Slackware is quite offten\nsmashed and bashed. It seems mostly by people who either haven't used it,\nor NEED a GUI with pretty pictures to run a computer. You are in the position to influcence people. Obtaining an article on a\nmajor open source / linux site. It is your responsibility to at least know\nwhat products / projects you are telling people to \"abandon\". \"Icertainly hope (and to some degree expect) that this situation's been\ncleaned up by now, but this made it impossible to audit slackware's\nsecurity if you wanted to.\" Well why don't you try it out before the next\ntime you go publicly trashing it!

They could all use a front-end script or dialogue which would ask\nnew users what actually needs to be enabled, and then disable everything\nelse by default.  Iwould rather assume that users who need the services\nwill need to learn enough about the process to be able to enable them\nthemselves anyway. The author makes a good point that if newbie users start having\nsecurity problems all over the place because services they know nothing\nabout and could care less about are enabled by default, this could have a\ndetrimental impact on the Linux community in general with bad press if,\nfor example, many thousands of these unsuspecting users become mail relays\nand stop-over points. I've used a number of the major distributions, and to my knowledge\nthey are all guilty of this. They should come out of the box with all\nservices disabled by default. The users who need these services will do the necessary research (it\nis hoped) to be able to use them in the most secure way possible, and to\nkeep on top of security advisories etc.  But you can't expect everyone who\njust wants to use Linux for themselves to be on top of it all.

[reply] [top] [ » ] Read the message, not the words by Daniel Lawson - Jan 8th 2000 20:17:55 Ithink people are getting a little bit too inflamed over the mistakes\nconcerning slackware. The point being made was, a lot of people use linux that do NOT have\ntime to, or even understand how to, secure their systems. Its exactly the\nsame with other more mainstream OSs - Iknow of several ppl who claim to\nbe NT admins, and yet dont even know where the MS security websites are. Sure, when Iinstall a linux system Igo through and clean out inetd,\nadd a decent ipchains firewall if appicable, and upgrade all the packages\nthat Iknow have security flaws. Does Jane Bloggs who just installed a redhat 6.0 (or *any* system) to\nact as their companies dialup networking server and webserver know how to\ndo this? Would she know what cron *was*, much less that the redhat 6.0 rpm\nhappened to have a buffer overflow in it? (Ithink it was rh6.0 anyway) Would she know what the significance of inetd.conf is, much less how\nto secure it? My take on the original article was not a dig at any particular linux\ndistribution - but a point about the level of education out there. And,\nhand in hand with education, we have ease of accessability. Half an hour a day, or even 5 minutes a day, might be enough to cover\nthe headlines of bugtraq and a vendor-specific security mailing list, but\nsomeone telling Jane that she needed to upgrade her cron package because\nof a nasty buffer overflow which could give root access wont mean a thing\nunless 1) Jane knows if she uses the package 2) Jane knows if its relevant 3) Jane knows *how* to upgrade - be it installing a new rpm / deb, or\ngrabbing a source tarball, applying the relative patches, and compiling\nit Ithink there are a lot of people who use linux, because of the hype\nsurrouding it, who dont know what they are doing. In my opinion, workstation distributions *should* be more or less\nsecure by default - with the exception of unforseen things like buffer\noverruns in packages etc.  Why do you need to telnet into a workstation?\ndisable it by default. Why do you need ftp? pop3/imap? www? disable it. If\nthe user needs it, they can set it up themselves. They need to learn. Similar sort of tactics should be taken on a server distribution. Oh no, people will cry, that will make it too hard! No one will use\nlinux if its too hard! Education.... We dont need distributions that do everything for us - unless we\nrolled it ourselves, and know what it does. What we do need is information\non *how* to secure it. Ithought the Bastille project was a good idea (although i never\nactually used it). Things like this need to be fostered and encouraged. We currently have screeds of disjoint man pages, HOWTOs which dont\nagree with your distribution (most of the ones i've read appear to work\nwith slackware, and bear no relevance to redhat), and package-supplied\nreadmes that can also bear no resemblance to your distribution-patched\nbinaries. Imake a generalisation above, Iknow. But we need more distribution\nspecific information on how to do these things. And it needs to be centralised, and put in a 'to-do' list so that new\nusers can *find* it easily enough. Hmm. Icould have spent the time it took writing this, to instead\nwrite a redhat-specific HOWTO's on securing your workstation by locking\ndown inetd, and checking for recent rpm updates.

This is in fact not true, and neather is saying\n\"Redhat is the most secure\" or Debian or Caldera, or any distrobution or\nOperating system.  Even your linux box in the corner of your office with a\nstatic ip, with just telnet and ftp services running, and all the latest\npatches you can think of put on it; is ALOT less secure then if you pull\nout the ethernet wire.  In this day and age there is no \"most secured\"\nlinux distrobution. There is always something else you can do to make it\njust a little more secure. All the linux distrobutions include programs written by not the people\nwho released the distrobution.  Which means in fact, that hundreds of\ndifferent programs, written by hundreds of different people are on the\nsame computer.  Thos will also mean that there is a very likely chance\nthat one or more of those programs will have security problems.  And Iam\nnot just talking about Linux, or just Unix in general.  Look at Windows 95\n98 and certan versions of NT: Hundreds of programmers work on them, from\none major company, and there was a mistake in codeing that caused remote\nusers to be able to disconnect them from the internet.  Something like\nthat could happen in the linux world also, a popularly used program that\nhas a tragic flaw. Personally though, as many other people have said, when first\ninstalling any distrobution they have to spend time fixing up inetd.conf\ndisableing services that arent needed. Slackware is the same way, along\nwith other problems. So you can't say that out of the box Slackware is the\nmost secure, because it just plain isn't. Neather is anything.

Exploits used to come out for SunOS 4.x for precisely the same\nreason, but that didn't mean that Ultrix was more secure. (Point of fact,\nit probably wasn't, it was just less tested.) And the fact that Red Hat\nreleases security fixes fairly promptly means that it's possible to secure\nthe system in a pretty much up-to-date fashion. But that only answers half the question: so now Iknow why people take\nSlackware to be the target (because Imade a mistake which gave them a\nfoothold from which to attack me), but why do they think it's all about\nRed Hat?  On the basis of the article, it seems clear that  SuSE, Debian,\nand Mandrake are all probably more secure than Red Hat. The fact that I've\ngot a whole project just to secure Red Hat seems as much proof as any that\nit's not especially secure -- but the fact that they've got some security\nresources certainly means they're trying. (And Istarted Bastille not to secure RH for myself, but because there\nare dozens or hundreds of user-administered Red Hat boxes on the campus of\nthe university where Iwork.

[reply] [top] [ » ] Oops by Jon Lasser - Jan 8th 2000 14:01:16 Yep, Idid somehow manage to miss the Slackware security mailing list. Iswear Iwent to the site and looked around before claiming not to\nfind anything, but somehow Istill made a mistake. Ican't speak to the security or insecurity per se of Slackware 7, as\nI've not used it, but I'll note that most of the recent security holes in\nRed Hat and Debian (with the very notable exception of problems with Red\nHat's usermode tool -- a very, very serious problem) have been bugs in the\nunderlying code, not particularly related to either of those distributions.\nIf those bugs aren't present in Slackware, that's either because those\npackages weren't included in Slackware (not a bad thing, just a point of\nfact) or because Slackware fixed those bugs before anyone else knew about\nthem and failed to backpropogate the fixes. Idon't think it's the\nlatter. In the old days (pre 7.0, maybe another level back beyond that or so, Ican't remember the last version Iused), Slackware had huge numbers of security holes. They just ignored them. And the sources never\nseemed to be able to produce the binaries which were included -- sometimes\nit was obvious that the included sources were pre-slackware-patches, as the\ncompiler would spew errors. Icertainly hope (and to some degree expect)\nthat this situation's been cleaned up by now, but this made it impossible\nto audit slackware's security if you wanted to. But I'm really curious as to why everyone took this as an attack on\nSlackware, specifically. It certainly wasn't intended to be that. Icertainly think that Slackware's record on security could stand\nimprovement -- I'm more impressed with a large number of found and fixed\nbugs than an apparent lack of them in a full-featured Linux distribution\n-- but as far as I'm concerned in the article, this isn't about any\nparticular distribution. What it is about is why security is important, even if you\npersonally can handle yourself. Claiming otherwise is kind of like\nclaiming that ISO9660 filesystem support in Linux isn't worth keeping in\nthe kernel simply because you personally don't use it: it's a fundamental,\nenabling feature of the environment for any number of users. It's also about the importance of Linux's image in the media, and\nsimple things we can do to improve that image. If you personally don't\ncare who besides yourself uses Linux, that's fine. But Ineed Linux to\nlook good in the media, so that Ican push for it in appropriate projects\nat work and elsewhere. Also, a good image for Linux in the media makes it\nmore attractive for companies (ie Creative Labs) to write open-source\ndrivers for hardware which is nice to play with. :-) [reply] [top] [ » ] Slackware security by Jihad - Jan 8th 2000 13:32:01 Is it just me or does this \"professional\" not know what hes talking about? \nIve been using linux since slack 3.2 and ive found that slack is the most\nsecure distro, with debian coming in second and redhat coming in somewhere\nnear dead last, being the hackers paradise of buffer overflows and 'enabled\nby default' services that it is.

Its like watching a Baptist convention talking about the\nevils of Catholics/Lutherans (and as about as worthwhile). Slackware 7.0 is a very big improvement over earlier versions out there.\nPatrick seems to be much more in tune with putting out things with the\n4.0/5.0/6.0 Betas than Ihave seen him do in years (since the 2.x days). Idont know the reasoning behind it, but once slackware.com came into\nexistance... the quality of the Slackware machines Idealt with seemed to\nincrease also. Idealt with too many people with hacked Slack95 boxes with\nexploits that had been around way too long. Going to the cdrom.com site\nusually had out of date info. Now Isee a central site and people find\nthings rapidly and cleanly. Iused to use slackware up until 1996 when Iswitched to Red Hat because Iwas tired of finding exploits and the Slackware response was \"Well patch it\nand compile it for yourself. We will put out a fix next release\"... which\nnever came. When Ifound them in Red Hat, Isaw an RPM at a central spot. Now is Red Hat perfect? NO . There are bugs and it could\nalways tighten things up here or there. However Iknow every time a change\nis made to tighten security up... there are howls of \"Why did you change\nthis/that.\" The same is true for SuSE, Caldera, etc. You get slammed no\nmatter what you do because a) people hate change, and b) people like to\nwhine versus deal. Anyway back to the main point.. which is what is the problem. The problem\nis that Linux is not for System Administrators anymore !GASP! . Sorry most of the people who are using Linux\nprobably know only enough system administration to start a modem and stop\na modem... and that may be a stretch.  And that is what you get for having\nan open community and saying things like \"Stop using Microsoft... use\nsomething better... also we are a community versus an elitist club like\nXYZbsd, etc.\" (Not saying BSD is elitist, just a very common argument Ihear about why Linux is better). Most people use computers as an ends to a means as JWZ said. They use them\nto browse web sites, answer email, write documents and letters, scan\npictures in for a family album. The computer to them is nothing more than\na tool.. as much as the car gets them to and from work. With this being the case, and being that we are supposed to be a better OS\nand a better community... we need to make sure that we have a better\nattitude towards security. Idont feel boycotts are needed. Tools that\nhelp home users (not hobbyists) get working with Linux are what is needed. Anyway my 2 cents of many. Stephen Smoogen -- Where oh where is Carmen Sandiago?

If the system administrator doesn't know where to look for\nsecurity advisories and patches, then maybe it's time to find a new system\nadministrator. Iam not a system administrator.

That being said, Ialso have to agree with Nicko Acks in that Linux\ndistrobutions turn too many services on by default. Heaven forbid someone\nshould take the better route and leave everything off to begin with (like\nOpenBSD) and then let the system admininstrator turn on only the services\nhe needs. Having many distros may be a plus, in some ways, but it's also a\ndefinite minus too, considering that the (potential) user needs to\nconsider the pros and cons of each (or just run out and buy the newest\nversion of Red Hat like most people these days :p).

I'm a bit curious, what is your model of security OS ? Windows ? So\nyou never had a look on securityfocus (and others). Ican't see how we can have security actually without spend time for\nit.

You are missing the real enemy\nand misunderstanding the open software. [reply] [top] [ » ] a couple of points by Nicko Acks - Jan 8th 2000 07:57:56 The bigest problem that Ihave found with linux distributions is the same problem that Ihave faced with many commercial unix's: they have too many services turned on by default that are not needed. One of the bigest things that would be a help for security is that distributions go to a policy where installed software is only turned on when explicitly asked for rather than on by default.  While this will not  stop everything, it would stop a good portion of the new machines out there getting broken into right away. One thing comes to mind.  Why does every linux distribution need to be server oriented?  Ithink there is a real need out there for a completely client-side distribution.  This would take care of the extra services problem by making sure that servers are not even an option. Another issue that Ithink distributions should look into is finding a way to more easily distribute patches.   While it is a good thing that to have fixes come out quickly it is entire different problem with getting users to actually apply them.   Ithink the process of fixing bugs needs to be as simple as possible so that it can be as automated as possible (debian's app-get method for updating software comes to mind).   While this introduces even more possible security risks Ithink that it should be concidered at least for the new user. deffinitly a good editorial Jon...

Ihave come to believe that two things can make or break a diversity course-the instructor and the climate of the class. It is important to have an open, accepting environment with an instructor that facilitates discussion and encourages students to think critically about what they read and hear; an instructor that challenges ideas in a respectful manner. It is important to remember that for a majority of students, this is the first time they are openly talking about issues of race and diversity. If the instructor takes on an antagonistic position and/or students feel attacked, they will often shut down. Unlike many other content areas, issues of diversity often have an emotional component. Iremember a conversation once with a white male doctoral student, who asked if a certain author that was writing about diversity and assessment, was black. When Isaid yes, the student replied that he was surprised because the author was able to write the piece without “emotionality”, and therefore thought he was white. When Iasked what he meant, he said, “oh you know, when people of color talk about these issues it is almost always from an emotional perspective”. Unfortunately, that is the challenge for many faculty of color teaching diversity courses. You are often suspected of having a “personal agenda” and approaching the course from an emotional stance rather than a rational one. White faculty teaching diversity courses also have issues with which they have to contend. However, they generally are a different set of issues from those for faculty of color. The bottom line is that in courses that deal with diversity, one has to take into consideration the intersection of race as it relates to the faculty member teaching the course and the race of the students."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Assignments"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Second, a strong emphasis is placed on the personal growth of students and on students’ ability to examine themselves critically. This is the awareness piece. Thus, the assignments have been carefully chosen to facilitate this. My assignments have not varied over the years. What Ihave chosen has seemed to be effective in allowing the students to engage in self-exploration. For example, over the years, Ihave learned that when a class has over 20 participants enrolled, the level of participation diminishes. Some students just dont feel comfortable talking about “race” despite my trying to set an open, accepting atmosphere. For those students, the journal entries become an outlet for them to express what they were too fearful to say in class. Ironically, what they reveal is not really that controversial. However, Ithink it goes back to us as a society not talking openly about issues of race. Some students have difficulty overcoming the fear that they will be labeled a “racist” or that they will say something that is perceived as “stupid”. In a journal reflection, one student states, “Ibecame afraid to speak for fear of what others in the class might think. This does not mean that Idid not learn a lot in class, but more often Iwould discuss what was said with my white peers.” Because Ithink discussion of the issues is of utmost importance, Inow have students break into groups of no more than five in several of the sessions, to give them an opportunity to dialogue. Students have expressed that they like the small group discussions and find them to be less threatening. Other assignments include, a cultural heritage paper, cultural immersion experience, interviewing two people who are culturally different from them, and a final reflection paper."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Readings and videotapes"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Third, a solid and diverse knowledge base is important. At the beginning, when Ifirst taught the course, there were not many textbooks to choose from. In the past 10 years, the field of diversity has grown by leaps and bounds and so have the readings. Istruggle to keep my reading list reasonable as there is so much Iwant the students to read. At least a third of my readings are individuals personal account of their experience with diversity. These readings have been effective in helping students understand how issues of diversity impact a variety of people on a personal, and in some cases professional level. Ihave also included readings written by whites that discuss their own journey towards recognizing their ‘privilege’ and working towards the goal of becoming cross culturally competent. These have been particularly helpful for the white students who often have an overwhelming feeling of guilt. These readings allow them to see that their feelings are quite typical and provide them with a model for the evolvement of white racial identity. In addition to the readings, for the past five years Ihave used videotapes on a consistent basis. One videotape that has had a significant impact, from the students perspective, is the The Color of Fear . This is a very powerful video that addresses difficult issues of racism, prejudice, and oppression. Because my classes are overwhelmingly white, this video allows students to hear an intense discussion about these issues from a diverse group of men. Other videos used are Ethnic Notions , Tale of O , A Class Divided , True Colors , and In the Image of the White Man ."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Conclusions"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "When teaching this course, it is one of the few times that Iwish we were on semesters! Inever have enough weeks to fit in everything Iwant to share with the students. As a professor, Ifind the diversity course to be one of my most professionally fulfilling endeavors. After 15 years, Istill look forward to teaching the diversity course. Iknow that my journey has not ended. Every time Iteach the course, it is an adventure. Ialways tell students that Iwill learn something new from them. While Iimpart knowledge, challenge perspectives, and create dialogue amongst individuals, Itoo gain in ways that cannot be measured. In an assignment, a student reflects on his journey in this way. He states, “Ifeel this course was far more enlightening than any experience, or any other course Icould have taken. It opened my eyes to a world Ifelt was all but gone. I’m not so nave as to think racism is an obsolete phenomenon of the past. However, Ihave been shown that it still exists in a magnitude that is almost hard to comprehend.” Another student reflects on her personal journey in this way, “Ithink that one of the best lessons that Ilearned from this class was that there are no easy answers. Its funny that when you look at other people without talking to them you assume that they have it all together, and that they somehow hold the key to all the answers your are looking for. Ifelt that if Istudied people and understood them that Iwould be able to complete the person Iwas trying to be. Ithink the greatest gift Ireceived from this class was that it forced me to begin dialogues with people who Ifelt had the answers.” The first day Itell students that Ihope they leave the class with more questions than answers. If they do, they will hopefully continue to seek the answers to their questions, thus continuing their journey. And Icontinue my journey, teaching a topic that will hopefully help individuals celebrate and understand not only our differences but our similarities."}]}

Ipride myself in being different from other therapists in several ways.  Idon't think it's enough to be a good clinician:  without empathy and a personal investment in the client's success, therapy can drag on indefinitely without results.  My goal is to make myself unnecessary to clients - to help them get to a place where they don't need to speak to me every week to keep their lives in balance.   Iam an advocate \n                                  for my clients' personal goals. Ido not waste time and money on silence.  Ioffer advice, \n                                  insights, and share my own experiences when \n                                  relevant. Iview the therapy process as an opportunity \n                                  for a client to reveal him or herself completely \n                                  to someone who has both the skill and the commitment \n                                  to identify problem areas, ask the hard questions, \n                                  get to underlying truths, and to provide support \n                                  and comfort when clients feel vulnerable. My approach to human sexuality is enlightened, upbeat, and completely nonjudgmental.  Iblend therapeutic methodologies to tailor each course of therapy to the individual(s).   Iwork hard to help you help you forge tangible positive changes in your life and to heal from the past.  Iam incredibly proud of the progress that my clients make.  Nearly every client who has committed to a course of therapy with me has achieved\nthe goals they set and, more often, exceeded them.  Ilove \"graduating\" clients.

After his capture, the suspect told officers he'd planted a bomb in the house that was ready to explode. Facing a hazard of unknown proportions, police officers called Wilson Fire/Rescue Services, which moved quickly to protect citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. \"We pulled up our GIS system on a terminal in one of our trucks.We pinpointed the house on the map, and it gave us an evacuation zone,\" said Chief Don Oliver, of Wilson Fire/Rescue Services. \"We could identify the houses we needed to evacuate by address, so we got everybody out.\" With citizens out of harm's way, police used a robotic device to remove the bomb from the house and disarm it in the street. \"It took us 12 hours to resolve the situation, but there was not a single injury,\" Oliver said. The incident offers a dramatic example of how Wilson Fire/Rescue uses mobile GIS technology to safeguard residents of this 50,000-member community in eastern North Carolina. Working closely with HP, the rural fire department has become a model for using geospatial information to improve firefighters' decision-making and effectiveness. HP teamed with ESRI to provide a sophisticated solution for Wilson's \"Fire Department of the Future\" GIS initiative. The project relies on HP business-critical servers, high-performance workstations and networking equipment. HP technology provides a powerful, reliable infrastructure for running ESRI's advanced GIS mapping applications. The fire department tapped into the city's existing GIS system for information on streets, water lines and hydrants, electrical and gas lines, and building and zoning specifications. A GIS fire analysis application allowed the department to add specialized information such as incident reports and fire inspection records into its system. GIS data generated by the system is loaded into computer terminals that are mounted in Wilson's firefighting vehicles. In addition, HP notebooks and handhelds help deliver GIS maps wherever they are needed. \"We run about 4,000 calls a year,\" Oliver said.\"What we're doing is taking technology and applying it to decision-making in the emergency-service field.\" Launched in 2000, the initiative provides new technology tools to address the firefighting needs of a changing city. Once one of the world's largest tobacco markets, Wilson's economy gradually is shifting from agriculture to manufacturing and pharmaceuticals. \"We have three and a half million square feet of warehouse space that is used for storing everything from rubber to pesticides,\" Oliver said. Wilson uses GIS technology to give them the answers. One byproduct of Wilson's changing economic base is a large number of vacant commercial buildings which Oliver cites as the city's largest firefighting hazard. Firefighters attacking a blaze in one of these buildings confront a series of questions: Is the building locked up? Can they be relatively certain that no one is inside? Is the building structurally sound? Could potentially hazardous materials still be stored inside? The department identified every vacant commercial structure in the city, rated its condition and plotted the data on a GIS map. Buildings were put into one of four color-coded categories based on their potential danger. Categories ranged from green for structurally sound and secure, to red for abandoned and dangerous the latter being judged too hazardous to enter under any circumstances. GIS maps showing the shape, size, location and condition of vacant buildings were loaded into computer terminals mounted in the department's fire trucks.\"So now, when the fire captain crawls into his rig, he enters the address and brings up a picture of the building,\" said Oliver. \"That tells him straight up whether he's going to be able to make an offensive or defensive attack on the fire.\" Geospatial information helps Wilson Fire/Rescue improve firefighter and citizen safety in other ways, too. Like any fire department,Wilson strives to make the best use of limited personnel and assets. GIS technology gave fire officials bold new insight into how and where to deploy resources. \"You know the old adage, 'Apicture is worth a thousand words?' Well, it's true,\" said Oliver. \"If Ican show you a problem, rather than tell you about the problem, you'll understand it a lot quicker.\" For example, the department moved one of its two light squad companies across town after GIS information showed the squad was stationed in the wrong place. \"One of the primary responsibilities for these companies is to respond first to emergency medical calls, saving wear and tear on our larger trucks,\" Oliver said.\"We had them in what we thought was the most centrally located stations in the city. But we found out that one of our engine companies was responding to over 600 EMS calls a year, and one squad had only responded to 143.\" Since its relocation, the squads cover the majority of EMS calls in the city. \"We provide better service now than we ever have,\" said Oliver.\"And we didn't make that decision until we put it on a map and looked at the picture.\" Expanding scope Using its fire analysis software,Wilson has begun applying geospatial analysis to data stored in its records management system. That insight helps the department identify patterns and eliminate risks that might otherwise go unnoticed. For example, analysis of the department's emergency medical calls pinpointed locations where traffic accidents occurred frequently. Armed with that information, the fire department convinced city planners to install new traffic signals and reconfigure intersections. \"Where we're really making a difference is being able to convey information taking data and creating pictures that show how we can mitigate issues before they become major problems,\" Oliver said. The chief would like to start applying those capabilities to other areas as well. \"We're looking at getting notebooks that our fire inspectors can carry with them in the field when they perform inspections,\" he said. \"Iwould also like to see all architectural drawings that are approved by the city become available electronically, so we could have the most current configuration for buildings loaded in our system.\" Oliver expects GIS maps to help the department strengthen its fire safety education programs too. Although the city's economy is changing,Wilson still has a large population of migrant agricultural workers, many of whom cannot speak English. GIS maps can help show where these workers tend to live and congregate, allowing the department to focus bilingual fire-safety programs where they will have the most impact. Spreading the word Given the program's current accomplishments and its promise for the future,Wilson Fire/Rescue entertains a steady stream of fire officials from other jurisdictions who stop by to observe the progress. \"Ican't tell you how many departments have been here Atlanta, Raleigh, Charlotte, Durham.We're sharing the story,\" said Oliver. He also appears regularly at public-safety association meetings to present information on Wilson's project. Oliver views his department's use of geospatial information and sophisticated computing equipment as a model for other firefighting agencies to follow. The city has become a proving ground for applying advanced information solutions to the business of firefighting. And working in close partnership with HP,Wilson Fire/Rescue Services clearly is proving that GIS technology helps provide safer communities. \"I've got the best fire department in the world. These folks are committed, they're energetic, and they want to do the best job they can. And we're giving them the tools to do it better every day,\" Oliver said. \"We're covering calls better and more quickly so we're cutting down on the number of large fires we have. We're getting to them at an earlier stage. \"The truth is,\" he said,\"this technology has raised the level of service and safety for Wilson's citizens and our firefighters.\""}]}
{"file_number": "7", "plaintext": [{"tag": "h3", "text": "Northern Ireland Conflict-Religion vs Politics"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "The conflict in Northern Ireland is likely one of the most closely watched and\nhotly debated disputes of our time.  Spanning now for over a century, what\nremains at the root of the conflict is unclear.  Many theories have developed\nover time, yet no one theory seems to adequately describe the complex struggle. \nThe conflict has been divided down many lines; ethnically between the British\nand the Irish, geographically, between the North and the South of Ireland, and\nreligiously between Protestants and Catholics.  Theories that have emerged have\npointed to causes such as land claims and a nationalist ideology, ethnicity and\nculture, and perhaps most frequently, religion when attempting to define the\nconflict.  In fact, what is more likely is that elements of all of these issues\nlie at the root of what is commonly referred to as \"The Troubles\".\nThe history of this contemporary conflict is detailed, but impossible to ignore.\nWhile different factions of the dispute would argue that the problem began\ncenturies ago, Iwill examine briefly the history of the \"troubles\" from the end\nof the 19th century forward.  For much of its history, Ireland has lived under\nBritish rule.   As the 19th century drew to a close, Britain became aware of a\nrapidly growing sense of Irish Nationalism.  In 1870, the Irish Protestants\nplaced the notion of Home Rule on the front burner in an attempt to separate\nIreland from the rapid secularism that was occurring in Britain.  Very quickly\nthe movement was picked up by Irish Catholics who saw Home Rule as a truly\nnationalist ideal, and by 1874 they had dominated the movement.  This pushed the\nProtestants back towards Unionism and was one of the many strikes against the\nidea of a united Ireland."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Feeling tremendous pressure to grant Ireland Home Rule, Britain began to talk\nabout making efforts to \"pacify\" Ireland, implying that it would indeed grant\ntheir wish.  Talks of Home Rule were then delayed.  The Irish saw the delay as a\nfurther political tactic of a British parliament who had no intention of\ngranting them autonomy.  The British struggled with the question of who would\nrun this complex society that was so heavily rooted in imperialistic tradition,\nand who at best had a shaky industrial and political structure.  This delay\nfurther divided Irish nationalists.  New radical forms of nationalism emerged,\nsuch as the Irish Republican Brotherhood and Sinn Fein, whose leaders were\nwilling to use violent means if necessary to secure Irish independence.\nAfurther divide between Protestants and Catholics also developed at this time,\nparticularly in the northern province of Ulster.  Unionists groups, who were\nProtestant by religion and British by tradition, were opposed to Home Rule\nbecause they believed that Ireland should maintain her ties to Britain.  In an\neffort to resist the Home Rule movement, they began to organize.  They created a\nProvisional Government of Ulster, complete with a constitution and raised an\narmy to defend it.  Further to that, in 1912 they created what was called the\n`Solemn League and Covenant' which bound their followers to use any means\nnecessary to resist Home Rule.  They gathered over a half a million signatures,\nsome of the Unionists even signing in their own blood. The debate over Home Rule was put on hold when World War Ibroke out.  The\nDublin Easter Rising of 1916 served as a reminder to the British that the\nquestion of Ireland's independence would need to be answered when the war was\nover.  Over 220 people were killed and over 600 more injured when Irish\nRepublican Brotherhood rebels took hold of Dublin.  The British, outnumbering\nthe rebels 20 to 1, eventually took back the city six days later.  In the face\nof what could have been a political victory for the British, they made the error\nof executing the surviving Irish rebels, martyring them and instilling anger and\ndetermination in the minds of many Irish Nationalists. The dilemma of Home Rule as the British saw it was how to given the Irish\nCatholics what they wanted while still providing for the Irish Protestants of\nUlster.  Their answer was the Government of Ireland Act of 1920, which created\ntwo separate parliaments, one in the North and one in the South.  These\nparliaments were charged with their own domestic affairs, but all foreign\naffairs and income tax collection remained in the hands of the British.\nFurther resistance and guerilla warfare eventually led to the Anglo-Irish Treaty\nof 1921, which outlined the creation of the Irish Free State, now known as the\nRepublic of Ireland.  It was made up of the provinces of Munster, Leinster and\nConnaught, as well as three of the nine counties of Ulster - Donegal, Monaghan,\nand Cavan.    Northern Ireland, now a legal entity made of up the six remaining\ncounties of Ulster - Fermanagh, Armagh, Tyrone, Londonderry, Antrim and Down -\nremained under British rule.   The division created an almost entirely Catholic\npopulation in the South of Ireland and a substantial Protestant majority in the\nNorth. The partitioning of Ireland was viewed by the South as a temporarily solution to\nthe `Protestant' problem in the North.  They maintained that not an inch of\nIrish land would be given up to the British.  In 1937, the creation of the Irish\nConstitution in the South laid claim to the six counties that remained under\nBritish rule and acknowledged that they were being held temporarily and\nillegally. Population divisions had always existed in the two major cities of what was now\nNorthern Ireland.  Belfast, the largest city and center of economic activity had\na largely Protestant population, where as Derry, a key center for the shipping\nindustry had a largely Catholic population.  Both cities also boasted a\nconcentrated minority group, yet conflict was not always inherent, as the\nminority did not pose a threat to the majority's way of life.  With the rise of\nindustrialization, there was a rapid migration of people to Belfast,\npredominantly in search of work and housing.  The majority of the people\nmigrating were Catholic, which began to present a problem for the Protestant\ncommunity.  Not only were they competing for housing and employment, but the\npercentage of Catholics in Belfast was not only rising, but they were beginning\nto organize.  As they learned how to use political institutions to wield\ninfluence, the Protestants became more resentful of their presence.  To the\nCatholics, their eventual control over Belfast was inevitable.  As Bernard\nHughes, the only Roman Catholic representative on the Belfast City Council in\n1857 stated, \"This town (Belfast) is governed by Protestants, but the bone and\nsinew of the town is Roman Catholic.\"(Brewer & Higgins 1998). What was born was\na conflict between the working class members of society, while the middle and\nupper classes struggled to maintain peaceful control.  The peace was not to\nlast. The decades to follow would be wrought with violence.  Battles would be waged\nbetween the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the Ulster Defense Association and\nBritish paramilitaries.  Thousands of innocent people would be killed in bomb\nblasts, riots and sectarian killings.  Even law abiding citizens lend support to\nthese groups, because the battle for the \"Cause\" on either side is paramount. \nWhat is it that turns these common citizens into killing machines?  What\nprevents any kind of peace agreements from taking hold in this conflict ridden\nnation?  The answer is perhaps more complicated than the conflict.\nTheorists have struggled over a solution to \"the Troubles\" in Northern Ireland\nfor a number of years.  Yet in seeking this solution, few have truly gotten\ninside the conflict.  Northern Ireland's battle has produced not only an\nenormous human cost but also a unique population that has been raised in\nviolence.  Understanding that population is key to any sort of peace agreement. \nThat understanding lies in examining what motivates both sides of the conflict.\nThe battle over land is one of the most common sources of conflict in history. \nIt is not surprising then that it plays a role in this conflict.  To the Irish,\ntheir identity was rooted in the Church and the Land.  British imperialism saw\nthe implementation of land lordship in Ireland.  Protestant landlords rented\nland to Catholic tenants, turning an economic system into one wrought with deep\nreligious animosity.  This represented not only conquest but religious\npersecution to the Irish. (Hickey 1984)\nThe Famine of 1845-1849 was a significant set back in Anglo-Irish relations.  It\nrepresented a failure of the British government to provide for the basic needs\nof the Irish.  It was also seen by some as an attempt to pacify the Irish\nthrough starvation.  The relief offered to Catholics during the famine also\nfurthered the divide between Protestants and Catholics, as it was often offered\non the condition that they attend a Protestant church.   It was becoming clear\nto Irish Catholics that the root of their hardship lay with the British and\nIrish nationalism gained momentum. Another one of the theories that have been presented is that the conflict is\nrooted in ethnic or cultural difference.  The obvious critique to this idea is\nthat the Protestant and the Catholic groups have one major thing in common -\nthey are all Irish.  Yet, these two groups would tend to differ in that belief.\nThe label Protestant has come to signify the Irish of the North that identify\nthemselves with British tradition.  They pledge allegiance to the British Crown\nand fight to maintain ties to Britain.  Despite the fact that they were likely\nborn in Ireland, they tend to associate themselves with being British.  They are\nalso referred to as Unionists, Loyalists or Orangemen.  On the flip side of that\nare the Catholics.  The population that falls under this label is considered\nethnically Irish.  They fight for a united Ireland, free from British rule. \nThey attempt to maintain the Irish language of Gaelic, and although there are\nfew places left that use it pre-dominantly, it is still taught in Roman Catholic\nschools.  These people are often referred to as Nationalists or Republicans.\nThe Irish argument then is that there is a distinctly `Irish' culture that is\nbeing stifled by a `British' majority in Northern Ireland.  The two keys\nelements of the `Irish' culture that make co-existence near impossible are that\nit is rooted in a nationalist ideology and that Catholic beliefs are intertwined\nwith that ideology.  Their belief is that harmony can only exist when all of\nIreland is united and the assimilation of the non-Irish is complete.\nThe major problem with this plan is two-fold.  Firstly, Protestants have a\nculture which they believe in and defend and do not wish to sacrifice. \nSecondly, Northern Ireland has existed as an independent state for over 80\nyears, and has likely developed a kind of culture that is unique and that may\nnot blend well with the culture of the Republic of Ireland. Religion seems to be the element that ties many of the theories on the conflict\ntogether.  Under the above pretense, the labels Catholic and Protestant are used\nto convey cultural and political connotations.  Yet religion remains an integral\npart of ones culture.  In the battle over land, religion maintains its tie\nthrough the battle between Protestant landlords and Catholic tenants.  Religion\neven has political links, as many nationalists, such as D.P. Morgan, the founder\nof the Leader newspaper, believe that the two ideas are inseparable: \"When we look out on Ireland we see that those who believe, or may be immediately induced to believe, in Ireland as a nation are, as a matter of fact, Catholics... If a non-Catholic nationalist Irishman does not wish to live in a Catholic atmosphere let him turn Orangeman.\" (Hickey 1984) It is important then to look seriously at the role that religion plays in the\nconflict in Northern Ireland. There are two sides to the religion debate.  One the one hand, some believe that\nthe labels Protestant and Catholic are just that - labels used to define two\nwarring factions of the conflict in the absence of a real ethnic divide.  Given\nthat one can point to ideas of territorial dispute, nationalism and culture as\npotential sources of conflict, it is easy to see where this opinion is formed.\nYet when examined more closely, there is merit in the argument that there are\ndogmatic differences in the two religions which keep the conflict at a\nstalemate.  While both Protestantism and Catholicism are forms of Christianity,\nthe beliefs surrounding how society should be structured can lead to political\nconflict. Catholicism is a very closely knit religion.  One of the key elements of the\nbelief is in the emphasis placed on prayer and sacraments.  The individual who\nadministers these sacraments becomes of the utmost importance, which results in\nthe creation of the priesthood.  This suggests a social order where the leaders\nhave significant control over the systems of a society. Protestantism in contrast is based much more loosely.  It is composed of several\nforms of Christianity, including Anglican, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist and\nthe Church of Ireland.  The appeal is much more direct - one where the minister\nprepares parishioners to meet God directly.   This poses a direct threat to the\nstructured organization of the Roman Catholic faith.  Likewise, Protestants fear\nthat if Ireland is united, their faith will be consumed by Catholicism.\nUltimately, the result is that the religious divide between these two groups is\nnot merely in symbolic membership, but also in the interpretation of the\nChristian faith.  As indicated by Professor John Hickey, \"it is more a question\nof religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion.\" (Hickey\n1984) Religion is often downplayed as a cause of the conflict in Northern\nIreland because Western pluralistic societies do not place as much emphasis on\nthe importance of religion in daily life. The question then becomes how does one find a solution to a conflict that\nis so multifaceted?  Belfast child psychologist Morris Frazer indicates\nthat what Northern Ireland is now faced with is \"a generation of children\nwho have lived with fear, have been taught to hate and who now aspire to\nkill.\" (Morrissey and Smyth 2002).  Here in lies the starting point to\nresolution - education.  It has become clear that in order to implement\na peace agreement between Protestants and Catholics, and to make positive\nprogress towards a bi-national state, a bottom-up approach must be used. There are a few key things that must be taken into consideration by all sides. \nThe first is that violence is not now, nor will it ever be, a successful\nbargaining tool.  Further to that is the idea that a peace agreement cannot end\nat the absence of direct violence.  Progress must be made towards a model of\npositive peace.  In order to achieve this, negotiations must consider the\npositions of the minority - Catholics in Northern Ireland and Protestants in\nIreland as a whole.  No one groups' rights can be infringed upon.  This would\nlead almost naturally to the idea of a bi-national state.  Coexistence is the\nbest chance that Ireland has at unification.  It is the only real way to obtain\npositive peace and a stable infrastructure. Peace Process Bombings, shootings and countless other acts.  Will the violence ever end?\nWill peace and stability ever come?   These were the questions that\nfor most of Northern Irelands history best described prospects for a\nsolution. For generations unionist and nationalist communities had been\nseparated as well as isolated from each other, turning to demonstrations\nof community strength to meeting with each other in negotiation and\ncooperation.  For the most part, the earliest attempts at peace attempted\nto make only mechanical political solutions.  These only reinforced\nthe already opposing relationships.  Relative calm followed the Ireland\nAct of 1949, which created the Republic of Ireland in the south. By the\n1950s, even Catholics in the North, still securely tethered to Britain,\nseemed ready to accept equality rather than pushing for securing a more\nunited Ireland, scholars note. But that changed after Northern Ireland's\nCatholics organized a large demonstration protesting discrimination\nin voting rights, housing and unemployment in 1968. Apolice crackdown\nfollowed, sparking months of violence and a reemergence of the Republican\nmovement. The subsequent bloody riots between Protestants and Catholics\nmarked the beginning of The Troubles, the euphemism for the period of\nviolence that would continue for years in Northern Ireland. Both the Irish Republican and British sides experienced breakthroughs in the\n1980s that would help to prepare the ground for the peace process.  The\npropaganda campaign around the hunger strikes started the Sinn Fein involvement\nin electoral politics and community action.  It was this event that started a\ntransformation.  This was the beginning of Sinn Fein's ascendancy over the IRA. \nThis was the beginning of a shift in emphasis from a military strategy to a\nprimarily political one, and a lowering margin of victory on which the\nRepublican outlook was focused, from the absolute principle of the right of the\nIrish people as a whole to self-determination towards ensuring that the\nimmediate interests of their core base of support were sufficiently represented\nin and by British state institutions.  This move into party politics would end\nup leading Sinn Fein to end their commitment to not take their seats in the\nDail, a commitment which had been a key principle for Republicans since as far\nback as the 1920s.  In taking their seats in the Irish Parliament and later in\nlocal councils in Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein was explicitly recognizing\ninstitutions set up under partition and thus implicitly recognizing the\npartition of the country itself. When Republicans did engage in a peace process contacts like nationalist John\nHume were to be important.  With the additional support from sections of\nIrish-America this cooperation with 'constitutional' nationalism became the\npan-nationalist alliance.  This connection acted as the go through which\nRepublicans were able to ease their movement from a confrontational approach to\na placatory one.  The role of intermediaries was to become very important in the\npeace process.  During the late 1980s contacts were made and a network of\nconnections developed.  But at this stage the contacts were largely secret and\nunfruitful, a reflection of both the pariah status of Republicans and the\ndistance between their stance and that of other political actors\nIt was not until these existing relationships were challenged, most crucially in\nthe Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 and subsequently in several other initiatives\njointly determined by the British and Irish governments, that the main parties\nbegan to participate in efforts to create a democratic peace.  The search for\npeace had always been overwhelmed by the violence that reinforced separation. \nThe British government's negotiation and signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement\nwith the government of the Republic of Ireland in 1985 marked some developments\nthat were to be important for the peace process.  The Agreement brought the\nBritish government closer with the government of the Republic of Ireland.  This\nwas also significant for moving away from viewing Northern Ireland as a purely\ndomestic matter for the British government.  The introduction and maintenance of\nthe Agreement was achieved against the express wishes of Ulster unionists.  This\nwas an indication of the declining power of the Unionists in Northern Ireland. \nUnlike the Power-sharing Assembly of 1974, Unionists failed in their attempts to\nwreck the Agreement.  Such a failure also indicated that the British government\nwas prepared to face down Unionist opposition. The current peace process began in April 1993 when John Hume, leader of the\nSDLP, and Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, met to discuss the future of\nNorthern Ireland.  An idea of determination for the people of Ireland was a\nmajor priority.  And they hoped these discussions would lead to a historical\nagreement between the British and Irish governments.  Akey element of this\ndiscussion was that Britain should be willing to allow the people of Ireland to\ndecide their own political future.  This meant that they had to accept the\npossibility of a united Ireland.  Furthermore, they were to call on Britain to\ndeclare it had no selfish, political, strategic, or economic interest in\nNorthern Ireland. SF in past years had shown some signs that they wished to peacefully and\ndemocratically reach a political settlement in Northern Ireland.  Through their\ncoming together, Hume and Adams signaled a change in the Nationalists approach\nto the Northern Irish situation which would, eventually, entail Republicans\nbeing willing to abandon violence.  In this approach, Nationalist leaders hoped\nto appeal to a much larger percentage of the nationalist community and to the\nIrish people of the Republic.  Violence had reduced support for the Nationalist\ncause in the Republic of Ireland.  The task of SF would be to convince the IRA\nthat they could achieve their political aims without the use of paramilitary\nforce. The discussions between Hume and Adams would be the driving factor to talks\nbetween the British and Irish governments.  In June 1993 both governments came\ntogether to discuss the future of each governments relationship to Northern\nIreland.  For six months, both governments would try to reach a compromise.  The\nmain debate focused on the question of self-determination.  In the end the\nBritish government could not accept self-determination for the people of Ireland\nas a whole.  On 15 December 1993 the Joint Declaration on Peace was released. \nTo Republicans, the declaration was not seen as a solution to the conflict\nbetween the two communities.  The document claimed to create a structure in\nwhich a peaceful political settlement could come about. Both British and Irish governments knew that no democratic process could be\ninfluenced by violence.  It was also known that if the talks were to produce any\nlasting settlement the process would have to be as inclusive as possible. The\nabsence of political parties that represented the various paramilitary groups\nwas seen as a drawback to the possibility of a permanent settlement. Therefore,\nit was considered essential that Loyalist and Republican paramilitary groups\nshould be encouraged to enter into cease-fires. While politicians had struck a compromise, paramilitary groups had not.\nRepublicans spent some time seeking clarification on the Joint Agreement. Only\nwhen they felt the agreement would allow them to pursue their objectives\npolitically would they consider a cease-fire. Loyalist violence was a response\nto Republican violence, but it was also a sign of their insecurity regarding\ntheir relationship with the British government. Although unionists were in the\nmajority in Northern Ireland and the document would only allow a united Ireland\nto be achieved by majority consent from the Northern Ireland population,\nunionists no longer felt they help the power. The SF put a lot of effort into the process that eventually was to bring about\nan IRA cease-fire.  SF was convinced that the IRA's objectives could be achieved\nbetter through democratic means.  The SF argument clearly influenced the leaders\nof the IRA. On 31 August 1994 the IRA announced their cease-fire.  Though it was\na victory for peace, it was not an all-inclusive Republican cease-fire.  There\nwere other less known groups such as the Irish National Liberation Army and\nRepublican Sinn Fein that did not consider themselves bound by the IRA's\ncease-fire.  Along and violent six weeks had past before the CLMC announced a\ncease-fire of their own. In 1995 both governments introduced a new Framework for Agreement. Peace in\nNorthern Ireland helped the British and Irish governments find a new confidence\nin their dialogue. Not only was the document a continuation of issues discussed\nin The Joint Declaration for Peace, it also introduced new ideas for future\ngovernmental structures.  Not everybody in the nationalist community rejected\nthe framework.  Some believed the agreement would be beneficial for the common\ngood, the proposed structures had the potential to benefit both communities\neconomically.  However, the unionists did not see it in the same way.  They felt\nthreatened and betrayed by the document, particularly by the proposed\nNorth/South structures.  In their opinion, a North/South institution with any\nkind of political power was a sure sign of a step towards Irish unity.\nThe decommissioning of paramilitary arms became an important issue as Northern\nIreland moved towards multi-party talks.  It became apparent that some of the\nparticipants would only accept those parties, who were linked to paramilitary\norganizations, into a talk's process if weapons were first handed over. \nOpposing parties saw this not only as unrealistic but also as an unfair\nprecondition on the entry to talks.  Despite the Mitchell report, the British\ndecided a separate committee should be formed on the question of decommissions. \nThis didn't go over well with Sinn Fein or the IRA.  On February 9th, the IRA\nended their cease-fire.  The process was to go on. Talks opened June 1996. The UDP and PUP were allowed to remain in talks because\nthe CLMC Cease-fire had held under difficult circumstances.  As expected, SF was\nnot allowed to enter the talks because the IRA had not resumed its cease-fire\nbefore the talks began.  It would stay without Sinn Fein and be overshadowed by\nIRA violence most of the time.  As September 1997 grew closer, and SF recognized\nthe British government's desire to include them in the talks or else proceed\nwithout them, the Republican movement reassessed its political situation.  John\nHume argued that a resumption of the cease-fire was once again within reach of\nthe government.  On July 18th Hume and Adams released a joint statement that\nsaid lasting commitment would only be achieved if it is based on principles of\ndemocracy and equality and has the allegiance of both traditions.   Two days\nlater, the IRA resumed its cease-fire.  Both governments reacted with reserved\nhope and waited to see if the cease-fire was genuine. If it were clear the IRA\nhad abandoned all paramilitary activity for six weeks, then SF would be allowed\nto enter the talks in September. The cease-fire held, SF was admitted into the\ntalks, and not surprisingly, their arrival marked the departure of the DUP and\nUKUP. After a sincere effort by both governments to make the multi-party talks\nall inclusive, the talks still lacked representation from all parties.\nViolence had a direct impact on multi-party talks as the early months of 1998\nbrought the suspension of two parties from the process.  The UDP and SF, after\nboth governments concluded that they had breached the Mitchell principles. The\nUDP is considered as the political wing of the paramilitary group the UDA / UFF\nwhich had been linked to many killings.  It was made clear that they would be\nallowed back into the talks after a period of time if they remained committed to\nthe Mitchell principles. In late February 1998, SF was also suspended from the\ntalks.  Both governments believed those two killings, that of a Loyalist\nparamilitary and a Catholic drug dealer, was the work of the IRA. As the talks\nwere nearing the May 1998 deadline, the two governments set an exclusion of two\nweeks provided there were no further breaches of the Mitchell principles. Alittle less than a month after the UDP walked out of the talks, they rejoined\nthem on 23 February 1998. Despite Unionist claims that the IRA was linked to\nrecent bombings, SF also were allowed back in the talks on 23 March 1998.\nIn an effort to overcome the political gridlock, the independent chairman of the\nmulti-party talks set a deadline for agreement as the 9 April 1998.  The\ndeadline did give the process a new sense of urgency and had been a good idea. \nDuring the last week of March and the first week of April serious problems still\nlay in the path of a political.  Not surprisingly, Unionists and Nationalists\nwere divided over how power would be shared in the proposed Northern Ireland\nAssembly, and the extent to which the Irish government would have influence over\nNorthern Ireland under the proposed North-South structures. In retrospect, the tensions that were apparent between the various groupings\nwere an indication of the historical compromise that was being asked of all\nsides. The midnight deadline, of 9 April 1998, was not achieved but parties and\ngovernments stayed at the Stormont castle until an agreement was reached. The\nimminent arrival of the Easter weekend, and the prospect of a collapse of the\ntalks, gave the process and participants a last push.   The news of the\nAgreement was reported in the late afternoon on Good Friday. Amazingly all the\nparties involved in the talks attended the final session in which George\nMitchell announced that an agreement had been reached and that the multi-party\ntalks were at end.  Those involved in the process were careful not to claim it\nas a victory for any particular party, but rather as the best agreement that\ncould be achieved in the circumstances. Is this a complicated process?  It most definitely is, but it is not impossible.\nSome people feared that these events would derail the peace process. Others were\ndetermined not to let that happen. After the 1998 Omagh bombing incident, a\nspokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair said, What the last few days\nactually have shown is that the Agreement and the peace process have survived\nand have emerged strengthened from the process. It is unclear yet whether this sentiment is true, or is merely wishful thinking.\nIn the past, there have been agreements reached that subsequently fell apart.\nWill this one be different? Maintaining this agreement will require tremendous\nwillpower on both sides. People who have traditionally resolved disputes through\nthe use of guns and bombs will have to learn the art of compromise. On the day\nthe agreement was reached, President Clinton said: \"All friends of Ireland and Northern Ireland know the task of making the peace\nendure will be difficult. The path of peace is never easy. But the parties have\nmade brave decisions. They have chosen hope over hate, the promise of the future\nover the poison of the past. And in so doing, already they have written a new\nchapter in the rich history of their island -- a chapter of resolute courage\nthat inspires us all.\" It seems clear that the majority of people are ready to undertake this challenge\nin return for a peaceful existence. Will their leaders be able to follow their\nwishes? Only time will tell. Bibliography Brewer, John D. and Gareth I. Higgins:  Anti-Catholicism in Northern\nIreland, 1600-1998.

You'll be surprised at the answer provided by the authors of a new book, Got     Game: How the Gamer Generation is Reshaping Business Forever . by Sean Silverthorne, Editor, HBS Working Knowledge"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "They are different from you and me, this generation born after 1970. They grew up with a finger on the keyboard and an ear to the cell phone, and in a world where the forces of globalization have broken down national barriers like no time in history. And right now this group is moving up in the business ranks, becoming managers, partners, and eventually CEOs. Chances are you manage employees from this generation, and it's not far-fetched to believe you may yourself be managed by them before you check out of your career. If the book Got Game: How the Gamer Generation is Reshaping Business Forever is correct, the \"gamer generation\" will make very different kinds of employees and managers. Is that a bad thing? They are loners, after all. Right? That can't be a good thing. And don't talk to me about the work ethic of twenty-somethings. Actually, say authors John C. Beck and Mitchell Wade, gamers will make great workers and great employees. They know how to work in teams, are creative problem solvers, and believe that nothing is impossible. But managers need to know what makes this new generation tick in order to manage them effectively. Our interview follows. Sean Silverthorne: You draw a distinction between the baby boom generation, who viewed gaming as a diversion, and the gamer generation, who grew up with games as part of their culture. What is important about this difference? John C. Beck and Mitchell Wade: Games have created a real generation gapwhich is more powerful because both sides tend to overlook it. Gamers have never known a time without games, and see them as a perfectly valid tool for solving problems, relating to other human beings, and discovering one's identity. Most boomers have never seen games as anything more than a toy, and as a result, are often shocked when they see what today's games can do. This has created massive differences in perceptions about how one looks at the worldhow to approach challenges, evaluate risk, and manage other people. Both gamers and boomers will need to overcome this communication gap in order to succeed together in organizations. But as is usually the case with generational conflict, the younger one has time on its side. So boomers need to listen and learn instead of lecture and lament. Q: For our baby boomers in the audience whose expertise with video games ended with Pac-Man, what kinds of games has this generation grown up with? A: Games are now much more than a blob of pixels on a screen. Games tell compelling stories, explore as well as violate societal conventions, and transport players to any number of worldsboth real and imagined. They are engaging to all kinds of people, use many different mental and social skills, and are fully part of life for people under thirty-five or so. Games have allowed players to care for virtual pets and humans. Games have let people play God, destroy civilizations, rehash classic battles, and make profound moral choices. Yet games get more powerful every day. One gaming company executive was quoted as saying, \"We're going to make games that will make you cry.\" So we can only imagine what the future will hold. Q: How have video games changed the way this generation views the business world? A: Gamers approach the business world a bit more like a game. They see the different companiesand maybe the people they work withas \"players.\" They're way more competitive and are very passionate about \"winning.\" They are both more optimistic and more determined about solving any kind of problem you can imagine; they think there's always going to be some combination of moves that will result in success. That drives them to be incredibly creative. They're a bit suspicious of company leaders: The game world is not big on following hierarchy. Plus, they are very confident. Like entrepreneurs, they would rather rely on their own abilities to succeed or fail. They're also more comfortable with risks, but aren't reckless. Q: What traits mark the gamer generation that could make them especially good managers, and what traits work against them? A: Gamers are ready to be great leaders, so they're motivated to contribute and to earn their way through whatever hurdles it takes to get to the (pretty elevated) place they believe they should be. Gamers are also resilient. They know failure is survivable, because they have each failed literally thousands of times on the way to whatever success they have had with games. (The failure hasn't been \"real,\" of course, but it has felt as real to them as the success has.) They're also savvyit's tough to pull one over on them. They may be a little overconfident in their own abilities, and they may not believe something doesn't work until they actually see it fail themselves. But with some guidance, managers should be able to marshal their best instinct, which is their love of being the hero. Q: Today's work environment is largely about team performance. Aren't gamers loners? A: This is one of the huge points creating the generation gap. Gaming is actually much more social than boomers understand. Alot of it is very social, done with friends, and now increasingly, over the Internet. Maybe as a result, gamers really value other peoplemore than people who didn't play games growing up.  They also firmly believe in a team environment. But they're not egalitariansthey believe someone should lead, they are generally happy to do it, and they have more skills than other people their age, more fluency with different leadership styles. Q: Do male and female gamers see the world differently from each other? Would female gamers make different kinds of executives than males? A: Historically gamers have been male, but that's changing. There are tens of millions of female gamers, and an increasing number of women are growing up gamers, participating in the same kinds of experiences. Male gamers tend to see the world in slightly more black and white terms and like to be the star, versus female gamers who care more about the social aspects. It's also been said that males prefer games where the player has fantastical abilities in everyday settings (think superheroes) and females prefer gamers where the player has no special abilities but is in a fantastical setting (think Alice in Wonderland). So some of the same differences you see between men and women in other settings carry through. But in some of the lessons of gaminglike taking measured risks, being the center of the actionwomen are learning those lessons as they play the same as men. That may change things we now take for granted. Q: More than one boomer has bemoaned the work ethic of twenty-somethings. What does your research show about this? A: We've heard those complaints. But what we found, to our surprise, is that gamers actually care about the companies they work for more than non-gamers. That may not always show, especially if you're using boomer standards. The secret is, gamers love a challenge and if properly motivated will rise to the occasion. They want to be respected and they want to earn that, but gaming hasn't given them a lot of appreciation for doing things \"just because.\" So it's smart to get them excited about the goal. Make the work mean something to them. Odds are, anyone complaining about a gamer's work ethic hasn't properly framed the task at hand to inspire them. And as one gamer pointed out to us, the boomers probably weren't getting much done in those years right after Woodstock. Q: What's the danger for boomer managers who don't understand the gamer generation? A: Boomer managers are leaving a LOT of value on the table, value that their competitors may not have seen yet, either. Gamers aren't just OK; they have some strengths that weren't standard in our generation. They can be almost maniacally dedicated and productive; for them, solving the problem can be a pleasant obsession like games were. And as they come to dominate the workforce, anyone who doesn't understand them will become increasingly isolated. Imagine Ward Cleaver trying to manage in today's boomer-centric world. We're moving towards a more gamer-centered universe, both from a marketing and a management perspective. Boomers who don't understand the transition will run the risk of being left behind, unable to adapt. They'll either be trying to sell to people using completely wrong language, or they'll be trying to train using boring old methods like in classrooms and lectures. Either way, if they fail to adapt, they're going to waste a lot of the shareholders' money sticking to methods that don't work anymore. [ Buy this book ] John C.

Beck and Mitchell Wade Let's begin with one of the most subconscious and therefore most powerful things that gaming teaches its natives about their place in the world: They are all customers, and the customer is always right. Or, as members of the  game generation might say, \"It is all about me.\" The world of games  is deeply, implicitly commercial.  Games are a consumer product, of course. But they are also a consumer experience. Like shopping, games are experiences that partake of reality and that play on powerful emotions, but that are also carefully orchestrated to give you exactly what you have paid for. The adventure is controlled through the framework of the game itself, but universally the game puts the player in direct control of the situation, from fighter pilot to jungle explorer. Also, similar to shopping, games become far less compelling unless the game focuses all of your audiovisual inputs on the world within the screen. That trip to Abercrombie & Fitch is much less satisfying if you are consciously aware of the eye-catching displays and the simpatico clerks. In games, the moment you stop \"being\" a Jedi knight battling the dark side and resume \"being\" an ordinary guy on the family room couch, well, let's just say that you become a little less impressed with your own light saber. So the game world, like shopping, is a carefully\n constructed piece of theater. What's wrong with that? In itself, nothing. What's worth noting, though, is that many individual members of the game generation have spent thousands of hours therehours that otherwise would have been spent in experiences that are not consumer theater. 1 What if you had spent five or ten fewer hours each week in organized sports, in unstructured play with friends, in family events that      s dragged you to? And instead spent those hours in the mall, with an unlimited budget? How distorted would your view of the world, and especially your view of your place in it, be by your own current standards? Most of us would expect a huge difference. (And, as our data set reveals, we would be correct.) In everywhere but the game world, you have more responsibility, less freedom, and a lot less help from others to feel however it is that you want to feel at that particular moment. Unlike\n computer-generated characters in a video game, other people have free will. If they are parents or other authority figures, they'll boss you around. Even if they are your very best friends, they'll sometimes refuse to play what you want; they'll compete when you don't want them to; they'll suggest activities that weren't on your agenda; they'll ask for your support. They might even judge you. We're not suggesting that anyone should trade in real friends, family, and colleagues for virtual ones, though we know those thoughts sometimes do cross one's mind. But we are saying that, unless they really did grow up shopping just about all the time, with just about no constraints, boomers and their parents have probably never experienced a world quite so superficially self-affirming as the world in which gamers have largely grown up. The pleasures of interacting with live human beings are real and indispensable. But the player's role there is a far cry from \"starring\" in a shopping mall or digital game. It's the difference between everyone around you saying \"What about me?\" instead of  \"The customer is always right.\" And the game generation has grown up, in effect, hearing the latter.

Ask them this question: Can the open source software movement defeat (or severely cripple) Microsoft in the marketplace? With little academic attention focused on this question, Harvard Business School professors Pankaj Ghemawat and Ramon Casadesus-Masanell decided to dive in. Most research to date into the OSS movement has focused on the organization and management issues surrounding OSS. Ghemawat and Casadesus-Masanell chose to explore the fundamental competitive dynamics question: Will OSS ever displace traditional software from its market leadership position? \"We believe that there is still a great deal of confusion and puzzlement on how this competitive battle will develop,\" say the authors of the academic paper Dynamic Mixed Duopoly: A Model Motivated by Linux vs. Windows , which has just been accepted for publication in a special issue of Management Science . Ultimately, the authors believe, neither side is likely to be forced from the battlefield—Microsoft has too much market share and OSS offers too many benefits for users. But there are strategies each can use successfully against the other, as they detail in this e-mail interview. Sean Silverthorne: Why should OSS ever displace traditional software? Ramon Casadesus-Masanell and Pankaj Ghemawat: One main advantage of open source software is that because users can modify the code directly (as they encounter problems or have new ideas on how to improve it), the development cycle is significantly shorter. Proponents of OSS claim that if this demand-side learning (as we call it) is sufficiently strong, OSS will oust traditional software. In addition, software engineers claim that the better architecture of most OSS projects make them a potentially superior product, adding to the probability of success. However, OSS has disadvantages too. Most importantly, it comes from behind in terms of market share (installed base). Because the value of an operating system depends critically on the number of users, traditional software has an advantage. Clearly, a larger installed base implies that there will be stronger direct and indirect network effects, and this will enhance the value of the operating system to current and potential users. In addition, a larger installed base also implies that there will be more feedback on bugs and more suggestions for new features. Our paper introduces a dynamic mixed duopoly model in which a profit-maximizing competitor (Microsoft) interacts with a competitor that prices at zero (Linux), with the installed base affecting their relative values over time. We use a formal model to ask what conditions are needed for Linux to take over Windows. The questions that we address are: Is Linux's superior demand-side learning sufficient to win out? What is the effect of forced procurement by governments and some large corporations on the long-run equilibrium? How do cost asymmetries play out? Can Microsoft use piracy strategically to improve its market position? From a managerial perspective, these are significant questions. If it turns out that OSS will incontestably displace traditional software, software firms need to adapt as quickly as possible to the new competitive landscape by, for example, incorporating some aspects of the open source development model, or else be ready to exit. In fact, the model suggests ways in which the likelihood of OSS winning out can be minimized (see below). If, to the contrary, OSS turns out not to be a threat to the traditional model, firms should not waste time and attention trying to figure out ways to fight this battle. Q: Could you summarize your results? A: First of all, let us make a caveat regarding our approach. Our methodology is formal economic modelling. What this means is that we construct a stylized mathematical model of the relationship. The model captures what we believe are the most important features of the Linux-Windows competitive battle (faster demand-side learning on the part of Linux and an initial installed base advantage for Windows), but makes important assumptions regarding other aspects. Without these simplifications, the model would not be tractable and it would not be possible to obtain results. After having analyzed the base model, we relax some of these assumptions."}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "Harnessing demand-side learning more efficiently is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Our main result is that in the absence of cost asymmetries and as long as Windows has a first-mover advantage (a larger installed base at time zero), Linux never displaces Windows of its leadership position . This result holds true regardless of the strength of Linux's demand-side learning. Furthermore, the result persists regardless of the intrinsically better design and potential differential value of Linux.  In other words, harnessing demand-side learning more efficiently is not sufficient for Linux to win the competitive battle against Windows. Having obtained this basic result, we investigate the conditions that will warrant that Linux ends up forcing Windows out. We do this by modifying the model in two ways. First of all, we look at the effect of having buyers such as governments and some large corporations committed to deployment of Linux in their organizations. We call such buyers strategic . In addition to cost-related reasons, governments back Linux because having access to the source code allows them to verify that sensitive data is treated securely. Binary code makes it hard to figure out who has access to information flowing in a network. Companies such as IBM, in contrast, back Linux because they see in OSS one way to diminish Microsoft's dominance. We find that the presence of strategic buyers together with Linux's sufficiently strong demand-side learning results in Windows being driven out of the market. This may be one main reason why Microsoft has been providing chunks of Windows' source code to governments. Second, we look at the role of cost asymmetries. In the base model we assume that the cost structures of Windows and Linux for the development, distribution, and support of software coincide. Anatural question is then whether the central result that Windows survives in the long-run equilibrium regardless of the speed of Linux's demand-side learning persists if there are cost asymmetries. We find that because OSS implies lower profits for Microsoft, the larger the cost differences are between Linux and Windows, the less able Microsoft is to guarantee the survival of Windows. We also show that it is not all bad news to Microsoft. We analyze the effect of having forward-looking buyers and the presence of piracy, and conclude that both benefit Microsoft. We question the effectiveness of influencing forward-looking buyers' perceptions on the value of an operating system. The model suggests that the more forward-looking buyers are, the more advantageous it is to use fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) tactics to drive the competing system out. Consider SCO, a small \"vulture\" firm that had bought up the intellectual property rights to a particular version of Unix and threatened Linux users with lawsuits over infringement of those rights unless they agree to pay substantial licensing fees. IBM, which was one of the prime corporate sponsors of Linux as well as the target of a lawsuit by SCO that sought $1 billion in damages, alleged in mid-2003 that SCO was in cahoots with Microsoft. Our model indicates that if buyers are sufficiently forward-looking, such actions may jeopardize the ability of Linux to continue as an effective competitor in the operating system space. We also look at the effect of piracy and ask whether piracy can ever be beneficial to Microsoft. This extension was motivated by analyzing data on a cross-section of countries on Linux penetration and piracy rates. We found that in countries where piracy is highest, Linux has the lowest penetration rate. The model shows that Microsoft can use piracy as an effective tool to price discriminate, and that piracy may even result in higher profits to Microsoft! Finally, the paper investigates the societal welfare consequences of OSS availability by comparing different industry structures (monopoly and duopoly). We find that while a monopoly of Linux is always preferable (from the point of view of societal welfare) to a Windows monopoly, it is ambiguous whether a duopoly Linux-Windows is better than a Windows monopoly. The basic trade-off is the following: With a duopoly, more individuals and organizations use PCs because prices are lower, and this raises welfare. However, with a duopoly, no operating system ends up exploiting fully its potential because developers' efforts wind up divided between the two systems. However, with a monopoly, the efforts to develop new software and improve the platform are directed towards one system only and this may turn out to be better from a social welfare perspective. Q: In general, what surprised you about the results? What assumptions did you have going in that didn't hold up? A: When we began the project, we thought that network effects and demand-side learning would result in Linux forcing Windows out. After all, we reasoned, if Windows is sold at a positive price and Linux is free, there will always be Linux users, and if the strength of Linux's network effect is large, the value of Linux to prospective users should eventually become larger than that of Windows. Well… we were wrong (and this illustrates the usefulness of developing a formal model). What we had missed is that Microsoft's initial advantage (larger installed base) together with its pricing power allow the company to price strategically to control Linux's market share going forward. By lowering the price of Windows, the demand for Linux shrinks to the point where Linux is not a threat to the survival of Windows. The model also shows that a \"milking strategy\" (setting high prices in the short term and leaving the market at some point in the future) is not desirable to Microsoft. The reason is that if Microsoft follows such a strategy, as the last period becomes closer and closer, the relative benefit of abandoning it and lowering prices to survive a few more periods increases dramatically."}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "The model shows that Microsoft can use piracy as an effective tool to price discriminate, and that piracy may even result in higher profits to Microsoft!"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The \"Windows persistence\" result turns out to be robust to different specifications of the model. In fact, in the first few months into the project we had developed several alternative models and every one of them yielded this very same finding. In addition to this main result, we were also surprised to find that piracy may end up increasing Microsoft's profits. To understand why, notice that there are two types of pirates: those who would not have bought Windows in the first place because it is too expensive, and those who would have bought Windows but now decide to pirate it. The first category increases Windows' installed base without affecting sales. As a consequence, this group increases the value of Windows. And thanks to these pirates, Microsoft is able to set higher prices in the future (because the value of the system goes up). In addition, having these pirates means that Linux's installed base does not grow as much as it would have if piracy weren't there. The second type of pirates (those who in the absence of piracy would have bought Windows) reduces Windows' sales and profit. Thus, if the proportion of first-type pirates is sufficiently large, Microsoft's profits will increase with piracy. Finally, the social welfare result that a Windows monopoly is not always worse than a Linux-Windows monopoly was also unexpected. This questions the social desirability of policies aimed at guaranteeing Linux's survival. Q: You mention in the paper that the model is not to be taken as a literal model of the Linux/Microsoft competition. But can you say anything about why Linux has enjoyed success against Microsoft? A: Linux's success against Microsoft is still relative. In the client space, Windows is the undisputable leader, and in the server space, Linux and Windows have both been gaining positions for the past ten years. The big losers are Novell, Unix, Solaris… everybody except Linux and Windows. Despite this, Microsoft is visibly concerned about Linux's upsurge. The Halloween memos (see http://www.opensource.org/halloween/ ) are an obvious testimony of this concern: \"OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat to Microsoft, particularly in server space. Additionally, the intrinsic parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits that are not replicable with our current licensing model and therefore present a long-term developer mindshare threat.\" Microsoft has a great deal to lose if Linux wins the operating systems battle. Microsoft is a software company, and a defeat in operating systems would point to the vulnerability of its entire business portfolio. In addition, the operating systems group is one of Microsoft's biggest revenue generators. Moreover, to a large extent Microsoft's sustained success over time in such a dreadfully rugged landscape has been due to its dominant position in operating systems. It is well known that Microsoft won the browser wars leveraging its dominant position in client operating systems. And the same will happen in the media player space unless the American or European antitrust authorities prevent it. We expect Microsoft to put all its ammunition to fight this battle. Part of the reason why Linux has made significant inroads is the determination of Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation to have a free (as in free dom) operating system. According to Stallman, application software will never be truly free unless there is a free operating system that supports it. Thus, since the moment Linus Torvalds and Richard Stallman joined forces, a big chunk of the foundation's efforts have been directed at building a free operating system. Then there are some large corporations and governments backing the development of Linux. These players use Linux as a way to curb Microsoft's dominance. This support is important because there are tedious portions of the code that would rarely be developed spontaneously by members of the Linux-developer community. Q: From your modelling, what can Microsoft do strategically to remain competitive against a product that is argued to be of better quality, is updated more frequently, and is free? A: Afew actions that the model suggests Microsoft could do to remain competitive are:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Increase its own demand-side learning. Listen to the demands of the user community to better exploit the benefits of demand-side learning. Microsoft must facilitate communication between the user base and the company to have prompt feedback on the performance of its products. Make an effort to incorporate improvements in the code (fix bugs and introduce new features) as soon as possible. Reward those who propose improvements for the code. At the very least, Microsoft could publicly acknowledge those who proposed new features or discovered bugs. Feed its direct and indirect network effects. Support as much as possible the independent software vendor community so that the quantity and quality of complements is substantially above that of Linux. Encourage competition between the different ISVs. The lower the prices of applications, the more appealing the Microsoft system will be. Price discriminate. Give Windows and applications away to schools and universities so that users build their file libraries on Microsoft, not Linux. Minimize the number of strategic buyers. Let governments access the source code and give guarantees that sensitive data is treated confidentially. Price discriminate. Give binary away to organizations and individuals who are not willing to spend money on Windows but who would be willing to use Linux because it is free. Reduce costs to be able to sustain long periods of time with low prices. Decrease Linux's demand-side learning. Because the way to do this involves some questionable (from a legal point of view) actions, we will refrain from suggesting specifics. Lessen Linux's direct and indirect network effects. Make it as hard as possible for Windows applications to work on Linux. Same for MS Office documents. \"Promote\" Linux's code forking. Infuse fear, uncertainty, and doubt into the Linux user community. For this to work, the statements must be perceived as credible. Credibility requires some past FUD announcements to be realized."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Q: Is there a scenario where Linux could be kicked out of the market by Microsoft? A: Strictly speaking, within our model the only way in which Microsoft can get rid of Linux is by setting the price at zero. But, even if Microsoft did that, the company would still be selling MS Office for a positive price. Thus, we conjecture that even in this case, there would be people developing and using Linux. The more important question is: What motivates developers to contribute to open source projects in the first place? As long as the drivers are there, Linux will persist. Given that Linux was born in 1992 in an industry already dominated by Microsoft, and given that the financial motive is secondary, it will be very hard for anyone to oust Linux. The organizational stream of research on OSS has identified several drivers of motivation to contribute to open source projects. For Microsoft to have a chance to kick Linux out of the market, it needs to successfully fight them. First, some developers see software as scientific knowledge to be shared \"like the sharing of recipes among cooks.\" In fact, some describe software developers more like artists seeking fun, challenge, and beauty in their work than like calculative, square-minded engineers. Second, some individuals find it fun to go against Microsoft. As the OSS/free software movement gains momentum and developers foresee that victory is within reach, they increase their effort to accomplish this. Third, because most OSS projects have a log file listing all contributors to the code, some developers find it desirable to participate in OSS projects to signal their ability and to enhance their chances of promotion and professional advancement. Finally, user-developers sometimes fix bugs that they find and then release the improved code so that everybody can benefit."}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "It will be very hard for anyone to oust Linux."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "To the motivations of independent developers to contribute to Linux, we have to add the important support that the free operating system receives from companies and governments. As long as the motives that induce these organizations to back Linux persist, Linux will not go away. Finally, and as we mentioned above, having a free operating system is central to the mission of the Free Software Foundation, Richard Stallman, and Linus Torvalds. It is thus hard to see how Microsoft can \"persuade\" Stallman or Torvalds to cave. And even if it did… Linux is no longer Stallman's or Torvalds' property. The project is dispersed and there is no \"owner\" of the code. Thus, someone else can take the lead. Q: What's next for the both of you for future research projects? A: There are several ways in which our work on Linux can be extended. One avenue would be to empirically estimate the difference in demand-side learning between Linux and Windows. This would allow us to make educated guesses on the chances of survival of Windows and make managerial and policy recommendations to OSS advocates, Microsoft, and administrations. In its present form, the paper models the organization of Linux's development in a very stylized way. Having a closer look at issues of effort coordination may help us better understand how to deal with code forking, one of OSS's biggest potential problems. Asecond organizational issue that could also benefit from formal analysis is that of incentives to contribute to OSS. While most research on this issue has been sociological in nature, the economic approach may shed light on why supposedly rational individuals are willing to spend valuable time and effort without extrinsic, financial incentives. Afinal question that we believe is of utmost importance but that has not attracted much attention thus far (at least among academics) is: What are the drivers of adoption of OSS? Aside from its empirical relevance for both individuals and organizations, it is an interesting question from a theoretical point of view, too. The presence of network effects and demand-side learning make this a non-trivial problem. We conjecture that there are multiple equilibria and that the use of FUD to mold perceptions about future value becomes crucial."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Related Stories in HBS Working Knowledge"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Topics:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Economics , Managing Innovation , Computers and Software , Technology Adoption"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Industries:"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Software , Technology"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "The Organizational Model for Open Source The Secret of How Microsoft Stays on Top The Simple Economics of Open Source"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Latest on Economics"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Latest on Managing Innovation"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Latest on Computers and Software"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Latest on Technology Adoption"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Sign Up for Our Newsletter"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Receive the HBS Working Knowledge e-mail newsletter each week—new business research and ideas delivered to your inbox."}]}
{"file_number": "72", "plaintext": [{"tag": "h1", "text": "Health Care Renewal"}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Thursday, May 26, 2005"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "A Troubling Study of the Contracts Between Medical Schools and Corporate Research Sponsors"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The NEJM article about contracts for clinical trials between academic health centers (AHCs) and pharmaceutical companies mentioned in an earlier post deserves further attention. (The study is available here , and its citation is Mello MM, Clarridge BR, Studdert DM. Academic medical centers' standards for clinical-trial agreements with industry. N Engl J Med 2005; 352: 21.) First, let me summarze the study's design. The authors sent a survey to senior administrators in the offices of sponsored research in 122 medical schools. They received responses from 107, for 91% response rate, excluding four schools that did no clinical research. They asked the administrators questions about provisions they would usually allow in contracts between their medical schools and corporate sponsors. The proportions who would allow some particular research practices follow: The sponsor will own the data produced by the research - 80% The sponsor will store the data and release portions to the investigator - 35% The investigators (whether at your site or any other site) are not permitted to alter the study design after the agreement is executed - 68% The sponsor is permitted to alter the study design after the agreement is executed - 62% The sponsor may prohibit individual site investigators from publishing manuscripts independently of the sponsor or group - 15% The sponsor may include its own statistical analysis in manuscripts - 24% The sponsor will write up the results for publication and the investigators may review the manuscript and suggest revisions - 50% While the trial is going on, the investigators may not discuss research results (including presentations at scientific meetings) with people not involved in the trial - 66% After the trial is over, the investigators may not discuss research results (including presentations at scientific meetings) until the sponsor consents to dissemination - 21% The terms of the clinical-trial agreement are confidential - 62% After the trial is over, the industry sponsor may prohibit investigators from sharing raw research data with third parties - 41% In summary, this study suggests that some medical schools will acquiesce to contracts that prevent their faculty from having meaningful control over research projects for which they are the ostensible investigators. Some medical schools will allow corporate research sponsors to manipulate the design, analysis, and interpretation of results to increase the likelihood of getting the results the sponsor wants. For example, 50% of medical schools would allow the corporate sponsor to write manuscripts reporting on study results, and only allow faculty to \"suggest revisions.\" Thus, many medical schools acquiesce to contracts that could allow corporate sponsors to ghost-write articles. Furthermore, more than half of the medical schools acquiesce to contracts that are kept confidential, preventing easy discovery of manipulation of the conduct and dissemination of the research by the corporate sponsor. (To see specific techniques that corporate sponsors may use to increase the likelihood that research produces the results they want, see our earlier post about the article entitled \"Medical Journals Are an Extension of the Marketing Arm of Pharmaceutical Companies\" by Richard Smith.) To underline the context, in my experience, to do clinical research, most medical school faculty are strongly pressured by their institutions to obtain external funding to support this work. Those who cannot obtain funding within a few years of unemployment often have to find something else to do other than research. However, although faculty are expected to find sources of funding, it is generally the medical schools or academic medical centers, not the researchers, who negotiate research agreements, and although such agreements may bind faculty members, the money paid under their auspices generally goes directly to the faculty member's employer. Thus, individual researchers are under considerable pressure to find grant and contract funding, and to keep their financial sponsors happy, but must work under whatever contract provisions their employers negotiate. The New England Journal of Medicine article clearly suggests that some medical schools allow researchers to be bound by agreements that allow the study's sponsor to manipulate study design, analysis, and interpretation to make it more likely that the results will be to the sponsor's liking. Since clinical trials enroll real human beings as subjects with the promise that the data they contribute, and the risks they run, will lead to valid scientific results, allowing such manipulation appears to not only likely to produce biased results, but also to be allow unethical exploitation of human subjects, and thus is in conflict with the medical school's scientific and humanitarian mission. This is yet another illustration of leaders of powerful health care organizations acting in conflict with physicians' and medical researchers' core values. One can only hope that publicizing such practices will lead to more ethical research, and less exploitation of human subjects. By the way, Ido not in any sense mean to blame the research administrators who must try to negotiate these contracts. Note that 69% of the administrators \"perceived that competition for research funds created pressure on administrators to compromise on the language of the contract.\" 24% described the pressure as \"great.\" Ido blame the higher leadership of the medical schools for fostering a climate in which money is more important than doing valid, ethical research. This raises several important questions: Why don't some medical school leaders enforce clearer ethical standards for clinical research sponsored by industry? Are they so worried about getting the money, and so worried that they will lose contracts if they insist on ethical standards? Are they so steeped in the exteme relativism of the post-modernist university that they don't believe in such standards? Are they so used to violating their own mission to support political causes, as is documented again and again on the FIRE web-site , that they aren't troubled by violating their mission for economic reasons? Maybe it's time we start trying to address such questions. posted by Roy M. Poses MD at 3:45 PM"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "3 Comments:"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "This study builds on our 2002 work.  Multicenter clinical trial research is governed by standard agreements at all sites participating in a study-there really is little variablity within a study, only some varaibility across studies.  The final result is that when patients are randomized, the institution has not assuance that the sponsor will publish the overall trial results, not that there will be an independent process to assess whether in fact the trial is publishable.  Since the definition of research is the creation of generalizable knowledge, site investigators at academic medical centers are in fact deceiving patients when they recruit them to multicenter clinical trials if they ask them to participate in a research study under current agreements.  Even with the 2001 guidelines, the 2002 paper and now this paper, there looks to be little pressure to change practices.  Further, we need a single ethical standard for research-otherwise trials will move to non-academic sites in the US or off-shore. By Kevin Schulman , at 3:09 PM To people with experience in the area, these recent revelations will not be a surprise. The new interest is in getting firm information on the scale of it. Nevertheless, one should be cautions about interpreting some of these things at face value. For example, the 50% of cases where \"The sponsor will write up the results for publication and the investigators may review the manuscript and suggest revisions\" may seem a bit scandalous, in view of the opportuinity for distortion which it provides. But one can also consider that a sponsor contracts the investigation to an academic research team because they have the clinical/laboratory/library facilities, and the technical expertise, to perform a good investigation; while the sponsor has expertise in trial design, trial monitoring, regulatory requirements, and statistics. That sponsor may do a thoroughly ethical job. I'm sure we're all aware of cases where a sponsor would be unwise to keave trial design and statistics to a particular clinical research team! On the other hand, the sponsor may not do an ethical job (that door is after all open). So, in interpreting (e.g.) that 50%, one would like to know what proporion of it led to an ethically good outcome, and what proportion led to distortion of the results. On occasion, individual researchers vlow the whistle. Often, they may be reluctant. On the context of what the terms of research contracts should be, perhaps they should spell out not only who does what, but also why (e.g. the clinical team do not have experience in trial design). Ultimately, it would be desirable that all participants should be independent of the sponsor and responsible for the integrity of the operation. But perhaps that is utopian. ted Harding. By Ted Harding , at 5:52 PM There are a lot of bright people paying attention to clinical trials: sponsor, clinical physicians, FDA, editors, referees, and readers. All have interests and different levels of power. The FDA examines raw data sets. It is not easy to imagine that the situation is all that bad. On the other hand, physicians have to evaluate journal articles from non-randomized studies. These are the Wild, Wild West. Hundreds of questions can be asked and a few, most likely false positive, results are reported. No one can check anything as near as Ican tell. Ask for study details like the SAS code used for the analysis or the raw data and most likely you will get stonewalled. Most of this research is government funded. The vast majority of epidemiology studies do not replicate and epidemiologists don't appear to care.

The Data Protection Commission shall initiate an investigation prior to any processing for which responsible parties: a. plan to process a number identifying persons for a purpose other than the one for which the number is specifically intended with the aim of linking the data together with data processed by other responsible parties, unless the number is used for the cases defined in Article 24; b. plan to record data on the basis of their own observations without informing the data subjects thereof, or c. plan to process data on criminal behaviour or on unlawful or objectionable conduct for third parties other than under the terms of a licence issued under the Private Security Organisations and Investigation Bureaus Act. 2. The provisions of (1)(b) do not apply to public registers set up by law. 3. The provisions of (1) may be rendered applicable to other types of data processing by law or general administrative regulation where such processing carries a particular risk for the individual rights and freedoms of the data subject. The Data Protection Commission shall indicate in its annual report the extent to which, in its opinion, the said provisions should be rendered applicable to such data. 4. The Data Protection Commission shall notify processing referred to under (1)(c) to the European Commission. Article 32 1. Data processing to which Article 31(1) is applicable shall be notified as such by the responsible party to the Data Protection Commssion. 2. The notification of such data processing requires responsible parties to suspend the processing they are planning to carry out until the Commission has completed its investigation or until they have received notice that a more detailed investigation will not be conducted. 3. In the case of the notification of data processing to which Article 31(1) is applicable, the Commission shall communicate its decision in writing within four weeks of the notification as to whether or not it will conduct a more detailed investigation. 4. In the event that the Commission decides to conduct a more detailed investigation, it shall indicate the period of time within which it plans to conduct this investigation. This period must not exceed thirteen weeks. 5. The more detailed investigation referred to under (4) leads to a statement concerning the lawfulness of the data processing. 6. The statement by the Commission is deemed to be equivalent to a decision within the meaning of the General Administrative Regulations Act. This statement shall be prepared in accordance with the procedure laid down by Section 3.4 of that Act. CHAPTER 5. INFORMATION PROVIDED TO THE DATA SUBJECT Article 33 1. Where personal data are to be obtained from a data subject, the responsible party shall provide the data subject with the information referred to under (2) and (3) prior to obtaining the said personal data, unless the data subject is already acquainted with this information. 2. The responsible party shall inform the data subject of its identity and the purposes of the processing for which the data are intended. 3. The responsible party shall provide more detailed information, where given the type of data, the circumstances in which they are to be obtained or the use to be made thereof, this is necessary in order to guarantee with respect to the data subject that the processing is carried out in a proper and careful manner. Article 34 1. Where personal data are obtained in a manner other than that referred to in Article 33, the responsible party shall provide the data subject with the information referred to under (2) and (3), unless the data subject is already acquainted with this information: a. at the time that the data relating to him is recorded; or b. when it is intended to supply the data to a third party, at the latest on the first occasion that the said data are so supplied. 2. The responsible party shall inform the data subject of its identity and the purposes of the processing. 3. The responsible party shall provide more detailed information, where given the type of data, the circumstances in which they have been obtained or the use to be made thereof, this is necessary in order to guarantee with respect to the data subject that the processing is carried out in a proper and careful manner. 4. The provisions of (1) do not apply if it appears to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort to provide the said information to the data subject. In that case, the responsible party shall record the origin of the data. 5. The provisions of (1) likewise do not apply if the recording or provision of the data is required by or under the law. In that case, the responsible party must inform the data subject, upon his request, about the legal provision which led to the recording or supply of data relating to the data subject. CHAPTER 6. RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT Article 35 1. Adata subject has the right, freely and at reasonable intervals, to request the responsible party to inform him as to whether personal data relating to him are being processed. The responsible party shall inform the data subject in writing within four weeks as to whether personal data relating to him are being processed. 2. In the event that such data are being processed, the information provided shall contain a full and clear summary thereof, a definition of the purpose or purposes of the processing, the data categories to which the processing relates and the recipients or categories of recipients, as well as the available information about the origin of the data. 3. Prior to the providing of information referred to under (1) to which a third party may be expected to object, the responsible party shall give the third party an opportunity to express its views where such information contains data concerning that third party unless this appears to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort. 4. Upon request, the responsible party shall provide information concerning the underlying logic of the automated processing of data relating to the data subject. Article 36 1. Aperson who has been informed about personal data relating to him in accordance with Article 35 may request the responsible party to correct, supplement, delete or block the said data in the event that it is factually inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant to the purpose or purposes of the processing, or is being processed in any other way which infringes a legal provision. The request shall contain the modifications to be made. 2. The responsible party shall inform the requester in writing within four weeks of receiving the request as to whether and, if so, to what extent, it is complying therewith. Arefusal to do so must be accompanied by the reasons. 3. The responsible party must make sure that a decision to correct, supplement, delete or block data is implemented as quickly as possible. 4. Where personal data have been recorded on a data carrier to which no modifications can be made, the responsible party must take the necessary steps to inform the data user that it is impossible to correct, supplement, delete or block the data, even where there are grounds under this article for modifying the data. 5. The provisions of (1) to (4) do not apply to public registers set up by law where this law provides for a special procedure for correcting, supplementing, deleting or blocking data. Article 37 1. Where an important interest of the requester so requires, the responsible party shall reply to the request referred to in Articles 35 and 36 in a form, other than in writing, which takes due account of this interest. 2. The responsible party shall make sure that the identity of the requester is properly established. 3. In the case of minors who have not yet reached the age of sixteen, and of persons placed under legal restraint, the requests referred to in Articles 35 and 36 shall be made by their legal representatives. The information concerned shall also be provided to the legal representatives. Article 38 1. The responsible party who has corrected, supplemented, deleted or blocked personal data in response to a request under Article 36, has an obligation as soon as possible to inform third parties to whom the data has previously been supplied about the correction, addition, deletion or blocking, unless this appears to be impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort. 2. Upon request, the responsible party shall notify the requester referred to in Article 36 of those parties to whom it has provided such information. Article 39 1. The responsible party may require a payment for expenses incurred in providing the information referred to in Article 35, the amount of which shall be laid down by or under general administrative regulation and may not exceed ten Dutch guilder. 2. The payment shall be refunded in the event that the responsible party corrects, supplements, deletes or blockes data at the request of the data subject, on the recommendation of the Data Protection Commission or by order of a court. 3. The amount referred to under (1) may be modified in special cases by general administrative regulation. Article 40 1. Where data are undergoing the processing referred to in Article 8(e) and (f), the data subject may at any time register an objection with the responsible party in connection with his particular personal circumstances. 2. The responsible party shall take a decision within four weeks of receiving a notice of objection as to whether the objection is justified. In the event that the objection is justified, the responsible party shall stop the processing with immediate effect. 3. The responsible party may require a payment for expenses incurred in dealing with an objection, which payment may not exceed an amount to be laid down by or under a general administrative regulation. The payment shall be refunded in the event that the objection is found to be justified. 4. This article does not apply to public registers set up by law. Article 41 1. Where data are being processed in connection with the creation or maintenance of a direct relationship between the responsible party or a third party and the data subject with a view to recruitment for commercial or charitable purposes, the data subject may register an objection to such processing with the responsible party at any time and at no cost to himself. 2. In the case of an objection, the responsible party shall take the steps required to stop this form of processing with immediate effect. 3. Responsible parties, who are planning to provide personal data to third parties or to use such data at their account for the purposes referred to under (1), shall take appropriate steps to notify the data subjects of the possibility of registering objections. This notification shall be made via one or more newspapers or free-sheets, or in some other suitable way. In the case of regular provision to or use at the account of third parties, the notification shall take place at least once a year. 4. Responsible parties processing personal data for the purposes referred to under (1), shall make sure that data subjects are notified of the possibility of registering objections, whenever a direct message is sent to them for the said purposes. Article 42 1. No one may be subject to a decision to which are attached legal consequences for them, or which affects them to a substantial degree, where this decision has been taken solely on the basis of the automated processing of personal data intended to provide a picture of certain aspects of their personality. 2. The provisions of (1) do not apply where the decision referred to therein: a. has been taken in connection with the conclusion or execution of a contract, and 1. the request of the data subjects has been met, or 2. appropriate measures have been taken to protect their legitimate interests; or b. is based on a law in which measures are laid down for protecting the legitimate interests of data subjects. 3. Appropriate measures, as referred to under (2)(a), shall be considered as taken where the data subjects have been given the opportunity to put forward their views on the decisions as referred to under (1). 4.  In the case referred to under (2), the responsible party shall inform the data subjects about the underlying logic of the automated processing of the data relating to them. CHAPTER 7. EXCEPTIONS AND RESTRICTIONS Article 43 Responsible parties are not required to apply Articles 9(1), 30(3), 33, 34 and 35, where this is necessary in the interests of: a. State security; b. the prevention, detection and prosecution of criminal offences; c. important economic and financial interests of the State and other public bodies; d. supervising compliance with legal provisions established in the interests referred to under (b) and (c), or e. protecting the data subject or the rights and freedoms of other persons. Article 44 1. Where processing is carried out by institutions or services for the purposes of scientific research or statistics, and the necessary arrangements have been made to ensure that the personal data can only be used for statistical or scientific purposes, the responsible party shall not be required to provide the information referred to in Article 34 and may refuse to comply with the requests referred to in Article 35. 2. Where personal data are being processed which form part of archive records transferred to an archive storage place under Articles 12 or 13 of the Archives Act 1995 (Archiefwet 1995) , the responsible party shall not be required to provide the information referred to in Article 34. CHAPTER 8. LEGAL PROTECTION Article 45 Adecision taken in response to a request referred to in Articles 30(3), 35, 36 and 38(2), and a decision taken in response to the registering of an objection referred to in Articles 40 or 41, shall be equivalent to a decision within the meaning of the General Administrative Regulations Act, where this decision has been taken by an administrative body. Article 46 1. Where a decision referred to in Article 45 has been taken by a body other than an administrative body, the party concerned can apply to the district court with a written request to order the responsible party to grant or reject a request referred to in Articles 30(3), 35, 36 or 38(2), or to recognise or reject an objection referred to in Articles 40 or 41. 2. The application must be submitted within six weeks of receiving the reply from the responsible party. In the event that the responsible party does not reply within the time limit, the application must be submitted within six weeks of the expiry of this time limit. 3. The court shall find in favour of the request where it is ruled to be well-founded. Before handing down a ruling, the court shall, where necessary, give the parties concerned an opportunity to put forward their views. 4. The twelfth title of the First Book of the Code of Civil Procedure, with the exception of Article 429d(3), applies. Article 345 of the said Code does not apply. 5. The third section of the fifth title of the Second Book of the Code of Civil Procedure is likewise applicable. Article 47 1. Within the time limit provided for an appeal based on the General Administrative Regulations Act or referred to in Article 46(2), the party concerned may apply to the Data Protection Commission with a request to mediate or give its opinion in the dispute with the responsible party, or make use of the provisions concerning the arrangement of disputes in a code of conduct which has been the subject of a declaration as referred to in Article 25(1). In that case, notwithstanding Article 6:7 of the General Administrative Regulations Act, the appeal may still be lodged or the court proceedings provided for in Article 46 still initiated after the party concerned has received notice from the Data Protection Commission, or further to the provisions concerning the arrangement of disputes in a code of conduct which has been the subject of a declaration as referred to in Article 25(1), that the case has been dealt with, but at the latest six weeks after that moment. 2. During the period when the appeal and the proceedings referred to under (1) are being dealt with, the bodies responsible for dealing with the dispute may obtain the opinion of the Data Protection Commission. Article 48 The bodies responsible for dealing with the dispute shall send a copy of their verdict to the Data Protection Commission. Article 49 1. Where any person suffers harm as a consequence of acts concerning him which infringe the provisions laid down by or under this Act, the following paragraphs shall apply, without prejudice to other legal provisions. 2. For harm that does not comprise damage to property, the injured party has the right to fair compensation. 3. Responsible parties are liable for harm resulting from non-compliance with the provisions referred to under (1). Processors are liable for this harm where this was incurred as a result of their actions. 4. Responsible parties or processors may be exempted wholly or partially from this liability where they can prove that the harm cannot be attributed to them. Article 50 1. Where responsible parties or processors act in contravention of the provisions laid down by or under this Act and other parties sustain, or may sustain, harm as a consequence thereof, the courts may, at the petition of the other parties, impose a ban on such conduct and order them to take measures to remedy the consequences of that conduct. 2. Processing cannot form the basis for a claim by a legal person referred to in Article 1:2(3) of the General Administrative Regulations Act or Article 3:305a of the Civil Code, where the persons affected by this processing object thereto. CHAPTER 9. SUPERVISION Section 1. The Data Protection Commission Article 51 1.

They may also give more detailed provisions for the advisory board referred to in Article 53(4). 4. The rules and any modifications thereto shall be sent to Our Minister as quickly as possible and require his or her approval. Article 57 1. The Commission is represented by the chairperson and the two other members or by one of these persons. 2. The members shall allocate responsibilities among them and involve the special members therein as much as possible. Article 58 The Commission shall produce an annual report before September on the activities, policy pursued in general and the effectiveness and efficiency of its mode of operation in particular during the preceding calendar year.

The Commission, acting in an official capacity or at the request of an interested party, may initiate an investigation into the manner in which the provisions laid down by or under the Act are being applied with respect to the processing of data. 2. The Commission shall present its provisional findings to the responsible party or the group of responsible parties concerned, and allow them to give their views. The Commission shall present these findings also to Our Minister concerned, where they relate to the implementation of any law. 3. In the case of an investigation initiated at the request of an interested party, the Commission shall inform the said party of its findings, unless providing such information would be incompatible with the purpose of the data processing or the nature of the personal data, or unless important interests of parties other than the requester, including the responsible party, would sustain disproportionate harm as a consequence. In the event that the Commission does not inform the interested party of its findings, it shall send the said party such information as it deems appropriate. Article 61 1. Responsibility for the supervision of compliance referred to in Article 51(1) lies with the members and special members of the Commission, the officials of the Commission secretariat and the persons designated by decision of the Commission. 2. The persons referred to under (1) are authorised to enter a residence without the consent of the resident. 3.

Upon request, the Commission shall provide every assistance to the supervisory authorities of the other member states of the European Union, where this is necessary for the performance of their work. Section 2. The data protection officer Article 62 Aresponsible party or an organisation to which responsible parties are affiliated may appoint its own data protection officer, without prejudice to the responsibilities of the Commission under Chapters 9 and 10 of this Act. Article 63 1. The only persons who may be appointed as officers are natural persons who possess adequate knowledge for performing their duties and can be regarded as sufficiently reliable. 2. With respect to the performances of their duties, officers may not receive any instructions from the responsible party or organisation which appointed them. They shall sustain no disadvantage as a consequence of performing their duties. Responsible parties shall give officers the opportunity to perform their duties properly. 3. Officers shall take up their duties only after the responsible party or organisation which appointed them has registered them with the Commission. The Commission shall maintain an up-to-date list of registered officers. 4. Officers have an obligation to treat as confidential any information disclosed to them in connection with a complaint or request by data subjects, unless the said data subjects have given their consent thereto. 5. Officers shall produce an annual report on their activities and findings. Article 64 1.

SANCTIONS Section 1. Administrative measures of constraint Article 65 The Commission is authorised to apply administrative measures of constraint pursuant to the obligations laid down by or under this Act. Section 2. Administrative fines Article 66 1. In the event that responsible parties act in contravention of the provisions laid down by or under Article 27 or 28, the Commission may require them to pay an administrative fine of a maximum amount of ten thousand Dutch guilder. 2. The Commission shall not impose a fine where responsible parties give a reasonable explanation as to why they cannot be regarded as responsible for the infringement. 3. When deciding the amount of the fine, the Commission shall in any case take into account the seriousness and duration of the infringement. 4. The work carried out pursuant to Articles 69 and 70 shall be performed by persons who were not involved in drafting the report and associated prior investigation referred to in Article 67(l). 5. The authority to impose fines lapses in the event that, with respect to the infringement on which basis the fine can be imposed, criminal proceedings have been initiated against the infringing party and the investigation by the court has been commenced or the right to pursue criminal proceedings has lapsed under Article 74 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Article 67 1. In the event that the Commission establishes that an infringement referred to in Article 66(1) has been committed and that a fine needs to be imposed for this reason, the Commission shall draw up a report. 2. The report shall in any case state the following particulars: a. the infringement, with reference to the corresponding legal provision; b. the designation of the place and time at which the infringement was committed; c. the facts and circumstances on which basis it was established that an infringement has been committed. 3. Acopy of the report shall be sent to the responsible party referred to in Article 66(1). 4. At the request of responsible parties who have not understood this report sufficiently owing to an imperfect knowledge of the Dutch language, the Commission shall make every possible effort to ensure that the content of the report is communicated to the said parties in a language which they understand. Article 68 Responsible parties in respect of whom acts have been carried out for which they can reasonably conclude that a fine will be imposed on them for an infringement, shall not be required to make any statement in relation thereto. The responsible parties shall be informed thereof prior to an oral request for information being submitted to them. Article 69 1. Notwithstanding Section 4.1.2 of the General Administrative Regulations Act, the Commission shall give the responsible parties referred to in Article 66(l) the opportunity to put forward their views in writing or orally, at their choice, within a reasonable period of time. 2. In the case that responsible parties referred to in Article 66(l) wish to put forward their views and do not have sufficient understanding of the Dutch language, upon the request of the responsible parties, the Commission shall see to it that an interpreter is appointed who can assist the said parties, unless it can reasonably be assumed that this is not necessary. Article 70 1. Fines shall be imposed by decision of the Commission. 2. The decision shall in all cases state the following: a. the sum of money to be paid; b. the infringement for which the fine has been imposed, with reference to the corresponding legal provision; c. the particulars referred to in Article 67(2)(b) and (c). 3. At the request of responsible parties who have not understood the decision sufficiently owing to an imperfect knowledge of the Dutch language, the Commission shall make every possible effort to ensure that the content of the decision is communicated to the said parties in a language which they understand. Article 71 Decisions taken under Article 70 shall be inoperative until the deadline for making objections has expired or, where an objection has been made, until a decision has been taken on the objection. Article 72 The authority to impose a fine lapses five years after the infringement has been committed. Article 73 1. Afine shall be payable within six weeks of the decision imposing the fine entering into force. 2. Where fines have not been paid within the time limit stipulated under (1), the parties owing the fines shall be sent notice in writing to pay the amount of the fine, plus the costs of the notice to pay, within two weeks. 3 . Where payment is not made within the time limit stipulated under (2), the Commission can issue an order to pay the fine owing, plus the costs of the notice to pay and order to pay. 4. Orders to pay shall be served by bailiffs writ, at the expense of the persons owing the fines, and shall be enforceable within the meaning of the Second Book of the Code of Civil Procedure. 5. For six weeks following the day on which the writ is served, objections to the order to pay may be made by a writ against the State. 6. The objection has the effect of suspending execution. At the request of the State, the courts may cancel the suspension of execution. Article 74 Our Minister may decide on policy provisions governing the execution of the powers of the Commission to impose fines. Section 3. Penal sanctions Article 75 1. Responsible parties who act in contravention of the provisions laid down by or under Articles 4(3), 27, 28 or 78(2)(a), shall be punished with a fine coming under the second category. 2. Responsible parties who deliberately commit an offence referred to under (1) shall be punished with a prison sentence for a maximum of six months or a fine coming under the third category. 3. The punishable offences under (1) are petty offences. The punishable offences under (2) are indictable offences. 4. Besides the officials designated by or under Article 141 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the officials from the secretariat of the Commission designated for this purpose by Our Minister are also responsible for detecting the offences defined in this article. 5. The right to pursue criminal proceedings lapses where the Commission has already imposed a fine. CHAPTER 11.  TRANSFER OF DATA TO COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EUROPEAN UNION Article 76 1. Personal data which are subject to processing or intended for processing after they have been transferred, shall only be transferred to a country outside the European Union in the case that, without prejudice to compliance with the provisions of this Act, that country guarantees an adequate level of protection. 2. An assessment of the adequacy of the level of protection shall take account of the circumstances affecting a data transfer operation or a category of data tranfer operations.  Account shall be taken in particular of the type of data, the purpose or purposes and the duration of the planned processing or processing operations, the country of origin and country of final destination, the general and sectoral legal provisions applying in the non-member country concerned, as well as the rules governing the business sector and security rules applying in these countries. Article 77 1 . Notwithstanding Article 76, an operation or category of operations to transfer personal data to a non-member country which does not provide guarantees for an adequate level of protection may take place, provided that: a. the data subjects have unambiguously given their consent thereto, b. the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subjects and the responsible parties, or for actions to be carried out at the request of the data subjects and which are necessary for the conclusion of a contract; c. the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded or to be concluded between responsible parties and third parties in the interests of data subjects; d. the transfer is necessary on account of an important public interest, or for the establishment, exercise or defence in law of any right; e. the transfer is necessary to protect a vital interest of data subjects, or f. the transfer is carried out from a public register set up by law or from a register which can be consulted by anyone or by any persons who can invoke a legitimate interest, provided that in the case concerned the legal requirements for consultation are met. 2. Notwithstanding the provisions under (1), Our Minister, after consulting the Data Protection Commission, may issue a permit for a personal data transfer or category of transfers to a non-member country that does not provide guarantees for an adequate level of protection. Attaching to this permit are the more detailed rules required to protect the individual privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of persons and to guarantee implementation of the associated rights. Article 78 1. Our Minister shall notify the Commission of the European Communities of: a. the cases in which, in his or her opinion, a non-member country does not provide guarantees for an adequate level of protection within the meaning of Article 76(l), and b. a permit, as referred to in Article 77(2). 2. Where this follows from a decision of the Commission of the European Communities or the Council of the European Union, Our Minister shall lay down by ministerial ruling or by decision that: the transfer to a country outside the European Union is prohibited; a country outside the Union is considered to guarantee an adequate level of protection, or a permit issued under Article 77(2) is withdrawn or modified. 3. The notifications referred to under (1)(a) and (b) shall be published in the Official Gazette. CHAPTER 12. TRANSITIONAL AND FINAL PROVISIONS Article 79 1. Within one year of the entry into force of this Act, processing which was already taking place at that moment shall be brought into conformity with this Act and shall be notified to the Commission or officer as referred to in Article 27. The time limit referred to in the first sentence may be extended by general administrative regulation to a maximum of three years with respect to the notification requirement. 2. Atime limit of three years shall apply to the modification of processing of special data to comply with Section 2 of Chapter 2, it being understood that it is not necessary to make another request for the consent referred to in Article 23(l)(a) with respect to processing which has already taken place and which is necessary for the performance of contracts made prior to the date of entry into force of this Act. 3.

Is what we are seeing today de outcome of years of resistance by Revolutionaries,\r\nprogressive north amerikans, and citizens of otha oppressed nations of kolour; years of\r\nbattling neo-kkkolonial forces so We could have better living conditions or to shut down\r\nthese political prisons that are designed to carry out low-intensity warfare on those with\r\na radical politic and deny everyone their human rights?! Conditions which were so\r\nrepressive and dehumanizing that they compelled Comrad Kataza Taifa to cut of de tip of\r\nhis finger and attempt to mail it to de A.C.L.U. in protest of de barbarism being carried\r\nout at m.c.c. against kaptives? What has become of those concerned men who marched by de hundreds at i.s.r. in protest\r\nof de conditions at m.c.c. and to show solidarity for those being victimized there? This\r\npeaceful march around de wall at recreation resulted in de entire kkkamp being locked down\r\nand dozens of progressive elements being transferred to otha kkkamps thruout de state, but\r\nit showed We could come together across race, religions or political lines for a common\r\npurpose - kombating Our oppression. Where is de spirit that invoked a group of New Afrikan Freedom Fighters to speak out\r\nagainst - what was at that time - de upcoming legal lynching of Comrad Brotha Ziyon\r\nYisrayah? These souljahs, Afrika’s glorious children, would later be snatched up by\r\nracist pigs and held at gun point while being marched out of i.s.p. on to buses carrying\r\nthem to m.c.c. These souljahs would become known as de indiana 10, and later, de indiana\r\n6. There are so many more acts of heroism that could be mentioned here - too numerous to\r\nconvey in a brief article such as this. And while i’m well aware that i asked more\r\nthan one question, i felt it was necessary in order to show de seriousness of Our\r\nsituation. Is de low tide in de prison struggle here in indiana due to de “fact” that We\r\nare nolonger being oppressed or brutalized? Are politically active prisoners nolonger\r\nbeing kept in transit or being held on behavior modification units for years and years for\r\nno otha reason than Our political views?! Are kaptives nolonger being murdered by prison\r\nofficials?! If all of these things are continuing to be perpetuated against Us, then why are We\r\nfailing to organize on a collective and principled protracted level against this madness?\r\ni’m not talking about de type of support ones are extending just to get recognition\r\nfrom a particular segment of society so they can parade around as legitimate allies of de\r\noppressed. They engage in de struggle for 30 days, then you don’t hear from them no\r\nmore! “Protracted” means on going! Our oppression is protracted, thus Our\r\nresistance too must be protracted! Now is definitely not de time to become passive or silent. Kaptives, like Greg Goodwin\r\nat i.s.p., are being murdered by prison employees. De state is instituting phone policies\r\ndesigned to further restrict and monitor de communication We have with de outside world.\r\nRacist policies such as “Zero Tolerance on Gangs” are being used to terrorize\r\nNew Afrikans - political conscious and kaptured citizens - and strip us of Our so-called\r\ngood-time, and isolate and neutralize Us. Otha oppressive policies include de new drug\r\npolicy which if a kaptive fails a urine test or is caught with any drug or tobacco\r\nparaphernalia, they could loose their visits as well as their so-called good-time.\r\nUndoubted this will become a tool used to excommunicate PP’s/POW’s from de\r\noutside world by falsely accusing political activist of drug abuse, or planting these\r\nsubstance in his assigned kkkage by pigs or their stool pigeons. Prisons are being\r\nprivatized and not only are kaptives being forced to work for slave wages, but they are\r\nalso being demanded to pay rent!!! De main purpose of revisiting de past is so We can critically assess de failures and\r\nachievements of those before Us (and de situation five minutes ago for that matter, for\r\nit’s all de past), and based upon that knowledge, arrive at a concrete overstanding\r\nof Our present conditions and develop concrete solutions for tomorrow. We must build\r\ninside organization and outside prison organization on this indiana plantation that is\r\ndesigned to address Our concerns. That will challenge these repressive policies, and\r\nindeed de legitimacy of these kkkoncentration kkkamps and de overall system of domination. We have to teach this new generation of “rebels” entering de indiana prison\r\nsystem, about de struggles and sacrifices souljahs have made. Teach them about Balagoon,\r\nShaka Shakur, Taifa, Kalonji, and so, so many othas! This will instill in them a greater\r\nappreciation of de culture of Revolutionary Nationalism, and hopefully inspire them into\r\nbecome cadre. But remember, We can’t inspire them to do nothing that We AINT doing.\r\nTherefore We must move beyond de rhetoric! If We fail to pass on de torch to de next generation, We will be singing de same sad\r\nsong that de old man sang to de traveler...”they lost their history, so they\r\ndied”! And We will have no one to blame but Ourselves. ~ From one Generation to de Next Less We Forget! ~ Mangwiro A. Sadiki NARN We Can Only Do So Much - Without\r\nYou! By Abdul-Shaheed Muslim When i first came to prison, i learned about the struggles and sacrifices that were\r\nmade by prisoners, to bring about change, before i even arrived. While in prison i have\r\nmet, and participated with, the prisoners who continue to struggle and sacrifice for\r\nchange. Over the years there have been positive changes. However, with every positive\r\nchange, the DOC does that much more to make things worst. There is much change that still needs to be made. That means there is still much\r\nstruggle and sacrifice ahead. We all know that prisons are one of many battlefields in the larger struggle for true\r\nfreedom. We prisoners can struggle each and every moment, but the fact remains we cannot\r\ndo it alone. We have to have outside support - and this support must be continuous. True,\r\nwe have some support, but, let’s be honest - it is not as it should be, nor are the\r\nvarious supporters united as they should be. The prisoners, as well as the supporters, need to put aside the petty differences that\r\nare keeping us divided - thus, not allowing a result of continuous change for the better.\r\nLet us not fool ourselves, we are being watched. We prisoners know how we are being\r\nwatched - and the support groups/individuals are also being watched, be it over the\r\nInternet or through various other COINTELPRO methods. They are sitting back and saying,\r\n“they cannot even unite amongst themselves, so what do we have to fear of them?” When M.C.C., in Westville, IN, first opened, prisoners were beaten, chained to beds,\r\ngassed, etc. because of their striving to make a difference. There was a little bit of\r\nunorganized outside support. Many of these were newly formed groups that came to be\r\nbecause of M.C.C., many of the “big”, well known, groups were not really (better\r\nread truly) interested in being involved. However, when prisoners started starving\r\nthemselves and a prisoner cut off his finger tip, and M.C.C. started getting national\r\nmedia attention - then all kind of groups wanted to support the prisoners. Does all of that have to happen again, before the prisoners on the G.-A.S., S.H.U. and\r\nvarious other control units, get the support - a unified support - they deserve? Right now i happen to be on the G.-A.S. unit, and much needs to be done for the\r\nprisoners on the unit. So, i will speak about that. We are not allowed to take the G.E.D.\r\nor get substance abuse and anger management help. These are things prisoners must have to\r\nregain “lost good time” or receive even a chance of a sentence reduction in\r\ncourt. The prisoners receive bogus conduct reports, are harassed by the guards and denied\r\nmost of the rights we are supposed to have. For example: We are supposed to have one hour\r\nof recreation daily, but most times we only get 20-45 minutes (usually 20-30 mins.). It\r\ndepends on which guards are working that day. They literally tell you, “so what, file\r\na grievance.” Most grievances are never returned or ruled on! We’ve even had a\r\nguard go so far as to tell us, “we use the grievances to wipe our asses with.”\r\n(Well... if so, i hope they get some paper cuts on their rearend and the ink causes an\r\ninfection). i could go on and on about the things occurring on this unit, but it would\r\ntake up pages of this newsletter, so i will move on. Beatings of prisoners by guards is a major and growing problem throughout the state of\r\nIndiana, especially on the control units of SHU, NSB, DS, MSU, MCC and D-cell house. Many of the prisoners being beaten are the mentally ill and political prisoners (many\r\nare harassed and singled out for physical assault because of their filing complaints and\r\nlitigation against prison officials and guards). Our lives here in Indiana DOC are not\r\nsafe due to the extreme conditions and the possibility of brutality we must face daily. We are fed up with this injustice. Are you? We call upon you, the people, to be real\r\nwith us and with yourselves. Please contact the prisoners who write in this newsletter for\r\nmore detailed info about what is occurring on the units they live in. Continuously contact\r\nthe elected legislative members, the governor, members of the news media and the Indiana\r\nDOC and let them know that you are aware of the gross lack of regard for our rights as\r\nhuman beings - and that you will not stand for it (then, once you do this, please do not\r\nstand for it!) Help us expose the wrongs, the conditions, the racism and the brutality\r\nagainst prisoners in the Indiana DOC - and demand that an independent investigation is\r\ninitiated into the beatings and assaults (past and present) of prisoners by guards (i know\r\nof these personally, i have the scars to show it does occur). We call upon you to assist and help us now - not after a prisoner has been resorted to\r\nstarving himself, cutting off a finger (or been beaten to death by guards, which will\r\noccur eventually - again), because they need your assistance. We prisoners continue to look back at yesterday - and seeing tomorrow. What do we do\r\nnext? Please support prisoners. We can only do so much - without you!

PO Box 30 Pendleton, IN 46064 In Memory of Ziyon By Gamba Mateen Rastafari To: All concerned, We are approaching de third anniversary of de deliberate ~ murder ~ execution of Ziyon\r\nIshvah Yisrayah; for on July 18-99, is de date de state of indiana along with de indiana\r\nstate prison, Al Parke, Barry Nothstine, cpt.ast. now Buss, to name a few, began\r\nimplementing a biological-chemical warfare program. Ziyon as we know him still in our hearts and minds, was murdered by lethal injection,\r\nde first person to be murdered by these diabolic chemicals within de state of indiana. Let\r\nit be remembered dat dese people experimented on our comrade-Ndugu, de whole process\r\n(execution) took one hour and thirty seven minutes. Even though Ziyon had small veins it\r\nshouldn’t take that long. Let us take dis day and reflect upon de goodness-fruitiness of dis Askari, Ziyon was a\r\npolitical prisoner - prisoner of war, but most of all a spiritual foundation’ed man,\r\nhis heart was one with da Father-Universe and people. Many things can be said about dis man, but let us reflect upon our own interpretation\r\nof de fruitfulness of dis man. I’m requesting dat any people with some type of awareness and opposed de death\r\npenalty, to join in a one day fast in remembrance of our fallen comrade. Your support\r\nwould be greatly appreciated. In memory of Ziyon You remain in our hearts Gamba Mateen Rastafari - The Kosovo Kontradiction - By Bro. F.U. It’s been (50) years since the U.Shas went to Europe + butchered other Europeans\r\n(note: the last being nazi-occupied Germany). Ironically the U.S. got involved in world\r\nwar II for the same reason why they’ve gotten involved with Kosovo. It was O.K. for\r\nthe demon Hitler to hit neighboring fronts like Poland, Denmark, Italy and even France.\r\nBut, once he’d started to hit Britain with “fly-by’s” it had become a\r\nwhole other story. it was O.K. for Hitler’s government to butcher millions of\r\nso-called “undesirables” in Germany while still trading with the U.Sdictators.\r\nBut, once he’d began to bomb + butcher Britain/England, again, it had become a whole\r\nother story. The U.S. felt that it’s mad-brother Hitler had made a violatable move by\r\npounding on the “mother land” of the pirates, pilgrims, + settlers who’d\r\nstolen the land from the natives 400-odd years ago in what’s now called\r\n“America”. These “outcasts” were considered the scum of England, yet\r\nit didn’t take away the fact that the average Euro-settler in the U.S. is a direct\r\ndescendant of England/Britain. Thus; Hitler had violated by “slapping” the U.S.\r\ndictators mother (i.e. Britain/England). Thus; he had to be dealt with and he was. Besides\r\nthis; the U.S. felt that there was no room for two world rulers. So, again; he had to be\r\ndealt with. Now; in 1999 we have “Milosevic”. An individual who’s all for taking out\r\nany ethnic group in his region who’s either of Turkish descent, Islamic in way of\r\nlife, or both. Using the invasion of the Turkish (Turkey) Empire hundreds of years ago as\r\nhis excuse for butchering not only the men, but babies, women, + elders. Three of the most\r\nvulnerable targets in any war. Giving his troops the O.K. to cross over to neighboring\r\nregions + taking over. Sounds familiar? The U.S. got involved not because it cared about the refugees. For over (4) years the\r\nU.S. government ignored the butchering of refugees in that region by Milosovic. Question:\r\nSince when has the U.Sgovernment cared about Muslims being butchered? Answer: Never! So,\r\nwhy now? Because the massacre had gotten too wide spread + other parts of Europe were beginning\r\nto receive some “disturbing” news about Kosovo. This was bound to “leak\r\nout” due to how even the most poorest regions in Europe were/are allowed to plug into\r\nthe media satellites that’s governed by the U.S. + Britain. Unlike regions of color\r\nwho are barely allowed to plug into such media-satellites, let alone launch their own\r\nmedia-satellites into space. The U.Shad begun to see that slowly but surely\r\nMilosevic’s government was moving closer + closer towards other European regions.\r\nThus; causing more than just “local” strife in that region. The so-called\r\npresident/representative of the U.S. had made it clear during his national address on the\r\nday before he’s given his trained butchers/military the O.K. to launch a bombing\r\ncampaign on Kosovo, that the U.S. was concerned about an “united Europe” + that\r\nMilosevic was dividing the Europeans house. Now let’s try to draw out some wisdom\r\nfrom these words. For the past (50) years Europe as a whole has been “major conflict” free.\r\nUntil recently with the kontradiction in Bosnia & Kosovo. For the past (50) years the\r\nU.S., Britain, Germany, France, + Russia have been fueling internal conflicts in regions\r\nof color (i.e. Korea, Afrika, Mexico, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Palestine, Iraq, Iran,\r\nKuba, Peru, Hawaii, Japan, China, etc.). Causing brother/sister to turn on their own\r\nimage/people. Dismantling whole tribes in the rain forests. Slave labor in Indonesia.\r\nForced sterilization of women of color or they’ll receive no work in the NIKE\r\nfactories, etc. Causing mischief from one corner of our planet to the next. While most of\r\nEurope felt + acted like it was “safe” + war free. Now that Milosevic’s tested his long arm tactic, threatening the\r\n“stableness” of Europe; he must be dealt with. Because it’s hard (too hard)\r\nfor the U.S. & Britain in particular to focus both on dictating + causing mischief in\r\nregions of color while their foreparents lands (Europe) dismantling. This is too much for\r\nthe mischief makers (i.e. U.S., Britain, France, etc.)... So now we’ve got reactionary nations dropping bombs + guiding/misguiding missiles\r\nall over Europe (note: while still doing fly-by’s daily on Iraq). As of today (June\r\n13, 1999) Nato ground butchers are marching thru Kosovo. This is a part of the so-called\r\ncease fire agreement that Milosevic supposedly agreed to. Already Serb troops have\r\nexchanged fire with Nato ground troops. And Russia’s ground troops have been accused\r\nof blocking off the Nato troops with their tanks. Question: When was the last time U.S.\r\nmilitary troops have met “face to face” on the battle field with Russia’s\r\narmy? Answer: Never! Both nations are used to supplying other regions with weapons to\r\nfight in their name. But never have the (2) actually met face to face on a battle field.\r\nFinally “the eagle meets the bear”. This so-called “agreement” is just\r\nthe next stage that’s being set for yet some more kontradictions. Those of you who\r\nare taking a deep sigh of relief due to the so-called agreement, don’t become too\r\nlaxed. Because we’re dealing with masters of tricknometry. The smoking glass + mirror\r\nillusionists. The now you see it, now you don’t masters. David Copperfield’s a\r\nmere baby to what we’re dealing with. But, sign’s and symbol’s are for the\r\nconscious/aware mind. For the nodder/sleeper will surely miss the mark. Just a thought. - Peace Be Unto You All - One Luv! Bro F.U.

Khaldun #874304 PO Box 557 Westville, IN 46391 The Wake Up Call By Khalfani Baye February 15, 1999 Soon the Indiana legislatures will go into session. Abill has been\r\nprepared for introduction regarding prisoner mail. This legislation is equally important\r\nfor the \"free', citizen with whom the prisoner corresponds. The plan is to bring into\r\nfruition law that will permit unimpeded searches, confiscations and copying of outgoing\r\nand incoming prisoner mail, with the previously available \"requisite\" due\r\nprocess no longer being applicable. It must be understood that the rights (limited though they are) prisoners enjoy\r\nregarding mail are also rights guaranteed to those \"free\" citizens that we\r\ncorrespond with. These rights are guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution and made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment to that\r\ndocument. It must be further understood that these Constitutional Amendments govern this matter.\r\nThe state is in effect attempting to circumvent these federal protections and arbitrarily\r\nsuperimpose state laws. The matter regarding prisoners’ First Amendment rights is well established. The\r\nUnited States Supreme Court has addressed this topic since 1974 and these decisions are\r\nthe landmarks by which the states must set their policies and regulations. The state\r\ncannot make any laws that “legally\" take precedent over these federal rulings. Those of us prepared to challenge this boldness by the state of Indiana need only arm\r\nourselves with the federal authorities which clearly support our position and then let the\r\nchips fall where they may. Also, it is worth mentioning that the state of Indiana's attempt to literally smother\r\nthe voices of those of us held captive, extends to those we correspond with in the\r\n\"free”, world. This attempt also violates Indiana Constitution, Article One,\r\nSection 9, 11, 15 and 18. Attached, Ihave prepared a short document regarding the historical development of\r\nprisoner First Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

The First Amendment Claim The wellspring of First Amendment law regarding prisoners' legal mail can be found in a\r\n1974 United States Supreme Court decision (Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396 94 S.Ct.\r\n1800 (1974)). In this case, the court upheld censorship of prisoners, mail if two criteria were met: First, the practice in question must further an important and substantial interest unrelated\r\nto the suppression of expression . Prison officials must show that a regulation\r\nauthorizing mail censorship furthers one or more of the substantial governmental interests\r\nof security, order and rehabilitation. Second, the limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessary\r\nor essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved, i.e.\r\nsecurity, order and rehabilitation. The case of Martinez was construed and applied again in 1979. (Bell v. Wolfish, 441f\r\nU.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861 (1979)). In this case the court approved a \"publishers only\" rule that prohibited\r\nprisoners from receiving hardcover books from any source other than publishers, book\r\nclubs, and book stores. Eight years later, 1987, the Supreme Court considered Martinez again. (Turner v.\r\nSafley, 482 U.S. 78, 89, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2261 (1987)). In this case, the court held that a prison regulation that impinges on prisoners,\r\nrights is valid if it is \"reasonably related to legitimate penological\r\ninterests\". The court backed off the language in Martinez, the Turner court listed four factors by\r\nwhich to assess a regulation's reasonableness: 1) the existence of a valid, rational\r\nconnection between the regulation and the interest used to justify it; 2) the existence of\r\nother methods by which prisoners can exercise the asserted right; 3) the impact on\r\nprisoners, and prison resources in general, if the right is accommodated; and 4) the\r\nabsence of ready alternatives to the regulation. The Supreme Court again returned to the topic of prisoner correspondence in 1989.\r\n(Thornburgh v. Abbott, 49 U.S. 413, 19 S.Ct. 1874 (1989)). This was, in short, a return to\r\n1974 and Martinez. This court carefully noted that Martinez did not announce a \"least restrictive\r\nmeans\" test for prisoner mail, but the analytical point most significant to the\r\nMartinez decision was that the earlier delision had dealt with outgoing mail, while Thornburgh\r\ninvolved incoming mail . With regard to outgoing mail, the court observed: \"Dangerous outgoing\r\ncorrespondence is more likely to fall within readily identifiable categories: examples\r\nnoted in Martinez include escape plans, plans relating to ongoing criminal activity, and\r\nthreats of blackmail or extortion.\" The court then seemed to reestablish the Martinez standard for outgoing mail while\r\nlimiting the Turner Standard (1987), to incoming mail. The court makes this clear when\r\nthey write, \"As we do not here apply the Martinez Standard,\"; the implication is\r\nthat the earlier standard, as now clarified, does not apply in cases of incoming mail\r\nsuch as Turner, but still retains vitality. That vitality can only be with reference to\r\noutgoing mail. Still, the standard for assessing interference with prisoners' outgoing mail is not\r\nentirely clear (e.g. United States v. Workman, 80 f.3d 688, 698-99 (2nd. Cir. 1996)).\r\n(\"Where good cause is shown, outgoing mail can be read without violating prisoners'\r\nFirst Amendment rights\", noting that \"Turner ... is considerably more\r\ndeferential to restraints imposed by prison officials on prisoner rights than the standard\r\nof Martinez\") B . The Due Process Claim The United States Supreme Court dealt with this topic in 1981 and again in 1984. The\r\ncourt made the Constitutional protections clear (Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527 101 S.Ct.\r\n1908 (1981) and Hudson v. Paimer, 468 U.S. 517, 531, 104 S. et. 3194, 3203 (1984)). The\r\ncourt held: The Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is violated when a\r\nstate employee deprives an individual of property, without making available a meaningful\r\npost deprivation remedy. IT’S NOW OR NEVER By Herman Averhart-Bey Today just as was the case thirty years ago when the Black Panther Party first emerged,\r\nthe New African (Black) communities remain colonized communities that are controlled from\r\nthe outside by the capitalist bourgeoisie who in turn use New Afrikan (Black)\r\ncollaborators, petit-bourgeoisie, opportunists, and domestic neo-colonialists to control\r\nthe communities from the inside with their pacification programs designed to mislead the\r\noppressed in the interest of imperialist hegemony. These imperialist lackies, reformists,\r\nand revisionists are enemies of the oppressed masses and must be stopped at all costs and\r\nby any means necessary in order for the colonized and exploited masses to break the chains\r\nof neo-slavery. But first and foremost in the New Afrikan (Black) liberation struggle, the lumpen and\r\nlumpen proletariat must break with parasitism, but they are not alone. There are many\r\nconscious revolutionaries and those proclaiming leadership and elitism that must also\r\nbreak from the chains of parasitism, which means disunity with any and everyone that\r\ncan't, won't, or refuse to break with parasitism, and this too must be done by any means\r\nnecessary. In the struggle for national and international liberation, there is no room for the\r\nelitist mentality. There are no big I's and little u's. There is no better than the next.\r\nThere is only conscious, quasi-conscious, and unconscious. There is only teacher and\r\nstudent (and we are all both teacher and student). There is only the revolutionary and\r\ncounter-revolutionary. In the struggle for national and international liberation, we are\r\nall oppressed and colonized people just the same, and as lumpen and lumpen proletariat we\r\nhave a common enemy in capitalism, imperialism, fascism, zionism, racism, exploitation,\r\ngenocide, and oppression (i.e. class, race, sex. gender, and religion). So how can anyone\r\nhave an elitist mentality? Only those chained to parasitism entertain or consider the\r\nthought of the elitist mentality, which goes to make any such person no more than\r\nopportunist and counter-revolutionary. As we draw nearer to the year 2000 and the next millennium in the struggle for national\r\nand international liberation and self-determination, the oppressed and ex- ploited masses\r\nwithin the colonized communities of imperialist amerikkka are continuously being\r\nterrorized, brutalized, and murdered daily by the fascist, patrolling, colonial\r\noccupational personnel (cops) and racists. The capitalist bourgeoisie still control the\r\npolitics and economics of our communities by way of the New Afrikan (Black) collaborators,\r\npetit-bourgeoisie, opportunists, and domestic neo-colonialists who serve the interests of\r\nthe racist, exploiting, and imperialistic cliques of settleristic America. This\r\nEuro-Amerikan settleristic nation of amerikkka is the foundation and home base of\r\ncapitalism and imperialism, and leads the world in acts of terrorism, exploitation, and\r\ngenocide, and must be smashed by whatever means necessary. The lumpen and lumpen proletariat of the colonized conscious left, by being colonized\r\nwithin the belly of capitalism and imperialism, are in the best of strategic positions,\r\nmore than any of the world's people, to strike a crucial and shattering blow to the very\r\nheart and soul of capitalism and imperialism. As long as capitalism and imperialism are\r\nallowed to go unchecked from within its amerikkkan base, it continues getting stronger as\r\nit conquers more of the world's territory and practices genocide on more of the world's\r\npeople, while those of the conscious left within the very borders of imperialist amerikka\r\nwatch it carry out its policies of massive de- struction. It is long past time to stop fooling ourselves and prolonging the ineluctable\r\nconclusion. It's clear that the liberation struggle is a protracted struggle, but it's\r\nalso clear that the New Afrikan (Black) liberation struggle has been going on since the\r\nfirst slave was kidnapped. And as we engage in our over-extended, protracted struggle, we,\r\nas a New Afrikan (Black) people, are being imprisoned and placed on death rows by the\r\nthousands and murdered in our homes and in the streets of imperialist amerikkka. The time\r\nhas come to intensify the national an international liberation struggle within the borders\r\nof imperialist settleristic amerikkka. What the Panthers do more than anything else is\r\nthey set a standard that young black people particularly want to measure up to--It's a\r\nstandard of ag- gressiveness, of militance, of just forcefulness, the sort of standard we\r\nhaven't had in the past. Our idols have been Dr. King who, for all of his beauty as a man\r\nwas not an aggressive man, but the Panthers and Ithink Malcolm X, have set this new kind\r\nof standard that a great many people want to adhere to. ~ Julian Bond, April 1970 All power to the people! H. Averhart-Bey # 900086 W.V.C.F./SHU A6-106 P.O. Box 1111 Carlisle, In 47838 THE OFFICIAL MONEY SCAM WITH INTEREST By Zolo Agona Azania Prison is big business. Money and slave labor, after a captive person has been duly\r\nconvicted and sentenced in a court of law, is at the root of this foul business. Recently a new Business Administrator Mrs. Phyllis F. Newkirk, has been installed at\r\nthe Indiana State Prison. As business administrator she is the figurehead responsible for\r\nthe coordination and control of fiscal recording and processing. Money received at an\r\nadult prison from a source outside the department of correction shall be in the form of a\r\npostal money order, certified or cashier's cheek or government check. The wardens and\r\nbusiness administrators at each prison shall be held in strict accounting for all money\r\nheld in trust for a prisoner. I.C. 4-24-6-1 et seq. The funds on deposit in the prisoners\r\nTrust Fund Account are invested in Federally Insured Banks or Savings and Loan\r\nInstitutions. According to the Administrative Procedures Manual of Policies and Procedures of the\r\ndepartment of correction and state law, the interest shall be deposited in the Prisoner's\r\nRecreation Fund no less than quarterly. The Prisoner’s Trust Fund Balance Sheet is\r\nsuppose to show any interest accrued and transferred to the recreation Fund monthly. But\r\nthe prisoners are never advised or notified how much interest is accrued on their money. The officials are enforcing a bogus policy to prevent the captives from receiving money\r\nfrom anybody who is not listed on their visitor list. But there is no actual policy as\r\nsuch. It appears to me that these prison officials have devised a long term conspiracy to\r\nfurther isolate the captives from support by preventing them from communicating with\r\npeople on the outside through letters, among other things. A Prelude to this Incidious goal is perpetrated by rejecting all money received at the\r\nprison for a captive from a person whose name is not on their approved visitor list. This\r\nunderhanded ploy also undermines a captive’s visiting privilege because a\r\nvisitor’s name would have to be displaced on his or her list who might want to\r\nphysically visit a particular captive, merely for somebody else to be placed on their list\r\nto send them a little money once in a while."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Zolo Agona Azania #4969 Indiana State Prison PO Box 41 Michigan City, IN 46361-0041 U.S.A."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Mr. Zolo Agona Azania #4969 Indiana State Prison P. 0.

As you are well aware the commissioner shall lmplement\r\na department procedure in which a committed person may submit grievances arising out of\r\nthe administrative acts of the department that affect that person. Warden Andereon and the Business Administrator, Phyllis F. Newkirk, have established a\r\npattern of rejecting all money received at the prison for me from a person whose name is\r\nnot on my approved visiting list. This underhanded ploy also undermines my visiting\r\nprivilege because a visitor's name would have to be displaced on my list who might want to\r\nphysically visit me, merely for somebody else to be placed on my list to send me a little\r\nmoney once in a while. Moreover, my newspaper articles and other documents are confiscated and withhold from\r\nme merely because it's more than one copy. i am told by prison employees that multiple\r\ncopies are not allowed. The total ban on all publications violate the First and Fourteenth\r\nAmendments to the U.S. Constitution. i should be allowed to receive publications from\r\nvendors and publishers, subject only to legitimate security needs. My written grievances concerning my money, printed matter, and other things, are\r\nrejected by the grievance specialist, Mr. Schlene, in retaliation for going over his head\r\nbecause i complain that there are no means to appeal the adverse decision arising out of\r\nthe administrative acts of the department or one of its employees that affect me. The\r\ngrievance specialist who reviews and rejects the complaint is the same person who also\r\nreviews and denies the appeal. This letter to you is a good-faith attempt to exhaust my administrative remedies. Thank\r\nyou. Sincerely, Zolo Agona Azania #4969 c.c. file (2) Praying for a Miracle By Talib Becktemba Revolutionary Greetings; Ihave never been one to believe in miracles because i believe that human beings shape\r\nand control other human interactions. But as i evolve in this ever changing world and\r\nwitness the madness which affects us all, i am beginning to think that a miracle is just\r\nwhat it is going to take to transform some of these reactionaries into responsible and\r\nrespectable human beings who are committed to national struggles aimed at liberating New\r\nAfrika. We are confronted with so much difficulty within the course of Our daily lives that the\r\nsimple act of living is becoming a real chore. Iuse to wonder why some people would pray\r\nwhen confronted with various difficult situations because i know that there can never be\r\nany substitute for concrete struggles in its many manifestations. But when i realized that\r\nsome of Us are not praying for some god’s intervention into Our social realities, but\r\nthat they are praying for the strength and courage to struggle on because at moments in\r\nOur lives Our conditions become almost unbearable. Our systematic oppression, repression,\r\ndeprivation, and the colonial violence that We experience daily has effected the very\r\nfiber of Our being. Some of you may think that We are powerless to make a change and “to you” i\r\nsay that you don’t know your own strength. That power that We truly possess if We can\r\nget past all of Our petty differences and develop a love and concern for each other\r\nnationally as We collectively confront Our national crisis. And some of you may indeed\r\nbelieve that it is going to take a miracle to get past all of Our internal differences to\r\ndo this work together. But all it will truly take is the personal commitment of each one\r\nof Us to make this change and unite in common struggle. The miracle of change exists in each one of Us and all We have to do is realize Our own\r\npotential and work together instead of continuing to destroy Us all with Our individual\r\ndisplays of savagery. We have to rise above all this madness because it’s a new day. Uhuru Talib Becktemba Milk... By Imn Rasl Why would one species need the milk of another species? Cows drink cow’s milk,\r\ngoats drink goat’s milk, dogs drink dog’s milk. So, shouldn’t human beings\r\ndrink human being milk? That would seem more logical than humans drinking cow’s milk\r\nor goat’s milk. How common is it for a lion to drink milk from a female zebra?\r\nIt’s just not within its nature to do so. Picture a human being being breast feeding\r\nor being breast fed by a cow or goat. How silly does that seem? How many full grown\r\nanimals (e.g. bears, dogs, deer, lions, mooses, cows) do you know of that drink milk? Once we are weaned from the nipple there is no need for us to continue drinking our\r\nmother’s breast milk. If there was a need for humans to drink milk after we reach a\r\ncertain age then don’t you think human milk would be sold in gallon jugs at our\r\nneighborhood grocery stores? Let’s use some common sense for a moment.... When a\r\nchild is born its little bones aren’t quite strong enough. This is why it is unable\r\nto stand on its own or hold certain object of weight. This is also why the child must be\r\nbreast fed by its mother to receive the calcium it needs for stronger bones and\r\ndevelopment. Once the child reach 10-12 months old, its bones are usually strong enough to\r\nsupport its body weight, walk, and hold heavier objects, thus the child soon out grows the\r\nneed to be breast fed. Some babies are fed animal’s milk instead of its own mother’s natural milk.\r\nSimilac, and infantmeal are milk like formulas that are fed to new born babies as a\r\nsubstitution for its mother’s breast milk. The child is usually fed these kinds of\r\nformulas for a short time before being switched to cow’s milk. This cow’s milk\r\nis consumed from childhood to adulthood without the realization that it isn’t needed\r\nfor our growth and development anymore, not to mention the fact that it’s not for\r\nhuman consumption period. We see milk commercials and billboard signs advertising milk from cows as if its\r\nnatural for human beings to drink. Acommon phrase that we see and hear is, “Got\r\nmilk?” or “Drink milk, it does a body good”. But how could it do the body\r\ngood when it’s a known cause for colon cancer, more common amongst black people. It\r\nhas a number of ill effects on the digestive system such as, stomach bloating, excessive\r\ngas, intestinal complications, bowel disfunctions, constipation and of course the list\r\ngoes on. But let the farm industries tell it, it’s all good for us to consume this\r\nproduct. It’s all about the almighty dollar in this country and for the profit makers\r\n(capitalist) it matters not who’s health is effected later on in life by it. To the\r\nfarm industries, it all make sense. Let’s be real about this. Imean, how can something be both good and bad at the\r\nsame time for our bodies? What sense does it make to have “strong bones” yet, on\r\nthe other hand have serious digestive and intestinal complications which can and often\r\ntimes will lead to colon cancer? It just doesn’t add up. But of course it does (add\r\nup $$$$$$$) for the capitalist farmers of this country. It’s not beyond belief that\r\nif women could produce milk like cows and goats, her milk would be sold in cartons and\r\ngallon jugs at the corner grocery stores. Now imagine that.... Imn Rasl #854623 D-326-West Indiana State Prison PO Box 41 Michigan City, IN 46361-0041 Objective Will vs. Subjective Will By OBAM 6/12/99 The normal and prevalent belief is that we, homosepiens, the human species, are at the\r\ntop of the food chain. This can hardly be disputed. It is also a well established belief\r\nthat we are of a higher intelligence than all other forms of life and given dominion over\r\nall other species by God himself. Our “will” is thought to be for the most part independent as opposed to being\r\na result of socialization. The common belief among the populous (mostly ignorant to even\r\nthe basics of psychology) and even some social scientists is that even though environment\r\nplays a significant role in determining a person’s personality, character, morals,\r\nvalues, ethics, etc., that which will prevail over social indoctrinations is\r\n“independent will”. I’m sure you’ve heard many times statements to the\r\neffect of, “Iunderstand he had a childhood of abuse, drugs, violence, poverty, etc.,\r\nbut he knew right from wrong, and he ‘chose’ to do wrong”. These are\r\nstatements often made by prosecutors, victims and their families. You can even hear this\r\nsentiment voiced among those on the flip side of this equation - prisoners themselves. You\r\nalso hear, “Icame up in the ghetto, too, but ‘I’ didn’t turn to drugs\r\nand crime.” Well, Irespect their honesty if that’s indeed what it is, but it is\r\nderived from ignorance; ignorance of the dynamics of the mind; ignorance of human nature. Morals, values, and ethics, relatively, are not passed on through genes and are not a\r\npart of our “mental wiring”. However, mental wiring does play a part in how\r\nsharp or dull we are in perception and cognition. Genetics and the quality of prenatal\r\ncare can determine to a large degree the efficiency of our brain and nervous system, i.e.,\r\nwhether we perceive slowly or quickly; our ability to decipher and remember information;\r\nwhether we have a dull character or an erratic, hyper character. All these things can be\r\ndetermined by the structure of our brain and nervous system and also by brain chemistry.\r\nThese factors are for the most part independent of direct socialization, but they do not\r\ndetermine morals, values, and ethics. These are determined by socialization, i.e., family,\r\nhome upbringing, community, school, media, church, traumatic experiences, etc.; all that\r\nenters the brain by way of the five senses. The mind is an extremely complex entity. Though we seem to live according to our\r\nconscious decisions, the subconscious mind is what dictates to our conscious mind, and the\r\nsubconscious mind is constructed second by second, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by\r\nday, year by year from the “intake” of outside stimuli via the five senses. The\r\noverwhelming majority of information that we absorb we absorb subconsciously (without\r\nbeing aware of it), nevertheless it is absorbed and becomes a part of our subconscious\r\ninfluencing our emotions, values, ethics, etc., hence, our conscious decisions. Take\r\nethics in particular; the standard of what is right and just as distinct from wrong and\r\nevil. One may well know that certain activities are wrong “according to the law and\r\nthe mainstream moral standards”, but in his/her “own community and culture”\r\nthese activities are prevalent and accepted practices, and eventhough one knows that they\r\nare illegal and immoral, because of the manner in which they are portrayed, consciously\r\nand subliminally, the propensity for one to partake in these activities is much greater.\r\nThere are many variations, and one rule doesn’t apply to each and every individual\r\nsituation, but the only way you can miss my point is to be mentally deficient or either in\r\nextreme denial. Given different circumstances and a different upbringing, you could very\r\nwell be just like the person you despise the most. For the sake of argument, let’s say that everyone does have an independent will.\r\nHow then could you explain ones choosing to do wrong? Either they are bad by nurture or\r\nthey are bad by nature. It’s as simple as that. There’s no other alternative or\r\nexplanation. The opponents of my theory would have to argue that it is nature, because\r\nthey are opposed to the theory of nurture (socialization) as a cause of one being bad,\r\nevil, a social menace, etc. Now, if a person is bad by nature as opposed to nurture, how\r\ncan they be held accountable for their bad conduct? Think critically before attempting to\r\nanswer this question if you’ve never ventured on these grounds before. If a person is\r\nindeed a bad or evil person, Ipersonally do not believe that it is by nature. Istand on\r\nthe theory of socialization. This is not a crutch, an excuse, a scapegoat, etc.; it’s\r\na fact. No doubt, many misuse and abuse this theory as a scapegoat to further their\r\npersonal interest taking away from the legitimacy of the argument when presented under\r\nserious circumstances. To put this issue of psychology into a political, revolutionary perspective, let me\r\nbegin by stating that psychology is an integralcomponent of politics, revolutionary\r\npolitics in particular. Governmental policy (politics) influences social norms and\r\nculture, and social norms and culture in turn influence governmental policy, but the\r\nformer is the primary focus. Today in the U.S. we see the fanatical religious, right-wing blaming the so-called\r\nliberals for the country’s moral decay. In particular “Newt” blamed the\r\nliberals for the mass murder committed by the two teens at Columbine Highschool in\r\nColorado. On the one hand these hypocrites condemn “big government” especially\r\nwhen it interferes with big business, but on the other hand they seek to repress and\r\ncontrol every aspect of our personal lives. They seek to set the standards for proper\r\nfamily structure, family values, education, religion, responsible media, correct\r\nconstitutional interpretation, etc. and condemn all other opinions. The same restrictions of personal freedoms that are in practice now in this country are\r\nthe same restrictions of personal freedoms that this government was condemning so-called\r\ncommunist and socialist countries for ten, twenty, thirty years ago. Only here,\r\nthey’re called “social contracts”, i.e. anti-crime laws, war on drugs, gun\r\nsafety and control, etc. The U.Ssupreme court recently ruled that it was unconstitutional to prohibit\r\n“citizens” from hanging out on the streets simply because they appeared to be\r\ngang members. This has been in practice in Chicago since the early 90s. Eventhough it was\r\nruled unconstitutional, you can believe they’ll come up with something just as\r\nrepressive if not more so. As for their laissez faire (hands off big business) policy, you can bet that it’s\r\nnot for the purpose of promoting equality in the free market. It is exclusively for the\r\npurpose of furthering the accumulation of wealth into the hands of a few - monopoly\r\ncapitalism. The populous are blind to these facts, and even worse, many wouldn’t really care a\r\ngreat deal if they knew the reality of it all. The social institutions, i.e. media,\r\neducational system, religion, entertainment, etc. shape our ethics, values, etc. more now\r\nthan ever, because they are becoming more and more intrusive into our personal lives. Many\r\nsay you can’t legislate morals. Isay that legislation impacts social institutions,\r\nand social institutions impact morals, but no amount of legislation can overwhelm or\r\ncorrect the effects of capitalism that have degraded all that is spiritually sound and\r\nlife loving. It takes revolution. As Istated before, governmental policy, or lack there of, can influence social norms\r\nand culture. For instance, the government’s economic policy of laissez faire\r\n(allowing the market to proceed with little or no anti-trust protection) inevitably leads\r\nto the accumulation of the overwhelming majority of wealth and power into the hands of a\r\nsmall power elite and an ever increasing poverty class of despair creating a culture of\r\ncrime, violence, drugs, cut-throat individualism, ignorance, etc. The government’s\r\npolicy of refusing to prosecute clear cut cases of police brutality and corruption creates\r\na sentiment towards the C.O.P. (colonial occupational personnel) and the state of\r\nuntrustworthiness and vindictiveness to say the least, especially among poor people and\r\npeople of color while in turn creating a sentiment towards the cops and state among the\r\nupper class and most whites of patriotic protectors. The government’s policy of\r\nmisrepresenting history, especially in the academic and religious fields contributes to\r\nthe cultural perception of white superiority and black inferiority. The governmental\r\npolicies that give less opportunities to females, mainly economic opportunities,\r\nautomatically reinforces the already established culture of sexism, female subservience\r\nand inferiority - patriarchy. Each of these examples is a part of the U.S. capitalist culture in large part as a\r\nresult of governmental policy. These are major yet general examples, however the same\r\n“cause and effect” principle applies to individual situations, but are connected\r\nto the general culture. It’s been said quite frequently that prisons are microcosms of that society at\r\nlarge. The highest rates per capita of crime, murder in particular, suicide, imprisonment\r\nare in the U.S., and it is the only developed, industrialized nation in the world that\r\nstill has the death penalty, yet it is called the greatest democracy in the world. Well,\r\nlet me say this: Ademocracy is only as strong as the people’s level of political\r\nconsciousness. The people (proletariat) can not truly dictate if they do not truly\r\noverstand the science of society, politics and economics. They can only be dictatees;\r\npawns in the game of the power elite, voting for illusions. You ask, “how does all this relate to the title?” An unconscious person makes\r\ndecisions from a subjective will that is controlled by those in control of that particular\r\nenvironment. The following is an analogy stated quite proficiently by Mr. Hoover: “Having a subjective will is like being in someone else’s dream. Adream in\r\nwhich you have no power to create the scenes or change them. Let’s imagine that the\r\ndream is about life and the dreamer is able to make the laws and change the laws or he can\r\nmake ‘new laws’ to hold you in check if you begin to win in his game of life. He\r\ncould make you rich and famous or he could make you a wino, drug addict or a criminal\r\n(according to his law). In his dream, you are used to his ends. Your actions would only be\r\nreactions that he could control, calculate and predict and when he has no more use for\r\nyou, he could eliminate you from his dream. Or he may just decide to store you away in\r\nsome sort of ‘warehouse’ for his future use. Or perhaps he will supply you with\r\ndrugs and guns and let you smoke and shoot your way out of existence.” From the Blue\r\nPrint In order for capitalism or any other type of repressive, corrupt system to persist and\r\nthrive, the mass majority of the people must be of a subjective will. As Istated earlier, a democracy is only as strong as the people’s level of\r\nconsciousness. Democracy is synonymous with socialism, and in order for true socialism to\r\nexist, the people must be of an objective will which entails being conscious of\r\nsociety/environment and its ability to indoctrinate so they won’t be subject to that\r\nindoctrination. An objective will also entails the ability to shape the environment as\r\nopposed to being shaped by the environment. Now you may ask, “why would Iworry about\r\nbeing negatively indoctrinated if the system is socialist?” The answer: Eventhough a\r\nsystem may be socialist, in the interest of the populous, there is always a latent force\r\nlurking internally and/or externally seeking to overthrow the status quo. There are\r\ncontradictions to everything. This is the law of dialectics. Hence, what is necessary to\r\nkeep the forces of capitalism and other corrupt systems from overcoming socialism is not\r\nonly a conscious people but a system that systematically instills consciousness in the\r\npeople via the social institutions, i.e. education, religion, entertainment, etc. This is\r\nrevolutionary scientific socialism. You can not disconnect an individual’s actions and thoughts from the society and\r\nculture at large, and you can not disconnect culture and society at large from\r\ngovernmental policy. What may appear to be an isolated incident may very well soon become\r\nan epidemic; hence know this: Apeople’s collective will is a direct result of the\r\ntype of system under which those people live. True socialism - the objective will of a conscious people - is what we struggle for. In Global Solidarity, OBAM s/n Marc A.Tillman #940972 P.C.F. PO Box 30 Pendleton, IN 46064 “High Science with its Formula and\r\nResults: The Interview.” Introduction: This interview is given by: Rasuual Byrd-Bey. Iwill be interviewing my brotha man\r\nOlugbala Pili.Suggs, on the matters of what one must have to consider their self. Ascientist, one who is conscious in deeds.. Byrd-Bey: Brotha Olugbala, first let me say that there are some who will not be in agreement with\r\nsome of your information; that will be spoken on in this interview. What do you think of such? Olugbala: Well, we know that the Moorish Holy Koran explains this answer best. The lips of the wise are as the doors of a cabinet no sooner are they opened, but\r\ntreasures are poured out before thee! Byrd-Bey: My brotha man you answer well. So could you now tell me and others who may not know, but call ourselves scientists what\r\nscience is? Olugbala: Science is a system. It is a word taken from Latin, meaning “to know” that which\r\nwe use for knowledge, that we have collected and interpreted in a certain systematic way.\r\nWe also use the word for the process of collection and interpretation, so that a\r\n“scientist” is one who bring a formula of science; with the observation of\r\nunexplained facts Byrd-Bey: So, as the observer studies the observations what does he see? Olugbala: He sees interrelationships and patterns, but she generalizes a pattern to cover unobserved\r\nfacts, and he devises a tentative explanation of the pattern. A “Hypothesis.” Byrd-Bey: What does one do with this hypothesis you speak on? Olugbala: One then test the hypothesis on new observations with a planned experiment. And if the\r\nexperiment fails to confirm the hypothesis, the observers must formulate a new hypothesis\r\nand conduct another experiment. If that experiment does confirm the hypothesis; then the\r\nhypothesis becomes a part of the observer’s collection of “knowledge”.\r\nThrough repeated conformations along with success in helping to explain new observations\r\npromotes a hypothesis to the highest level of facts, principle, law and theory; Byrd-Bey: Could you also tell me and the other readers about one (1) crucial part of the scientific\r\nmethod? Olugbala: One (1) crucial part of the scientific method is (“caution”)\r\nresearchers-”seeker” go to great pain to avoid the many kinds of error and bias\r\n(encouraging one outcome or answer over the other) that can contaminate experiments. We\r\nconduct controlled experiments (where everything is the same except the variable being\r\ntested) to be sure that the results we see are “real” and not unforeseen effects\r\nof our experimental setups: Further we must analyze these results with statistics. Byrd-Bey: Could you explain to me and others about another essential part of the method? Olugbala: Another essential part of the method is “communication”, the greater parts on\r\nour list. However, observation, generalization, hypothesis, and experiment are all useless\r\nif they are kept secret; let’s take a look into this by saying, a result is not a\r\nresult -- it has no validity, no (credibility gap) -- if other scientist cannot obtain the\r\nsame result. As scientists we are sure you can fill in the blanks as words were left out;\r\nThus the scientist must write and publish scientific reports that explain observations,\r\ngeneralization, hypothesis, and experiments in detail so that others who seek can repeat\r\nthe work. Byrd-Bey: Okay now, tell us what science is firmly based on? Olugbala: Well, science is firmly based on the notion of repeatability; it has little room for the\r\nunique and for those who keep their methods or findings secret, and even less room for\r\nthese individuals who manufacture false observations and experimental results. Because\r\nthis demand for repeatability means that every step of a scientist’s work must be\r\ncheckable; science possesses an accountability and duty, a dedication to truth, accuracy,\r\nand completeness that surpasses all other allegiances. Byrd-Bey: Out of all that you have covered could you tell us what the “attributes” of a\r\nscientist is? Olugbala: As a scientist your “attributes” are as important as all other formulas. a\r\nscientist seek knowledge, truth, and “human survival”. Using the scientific\r\nmethod, potential scientist need the ability to work and think methodically; we should\r\nalso have other traits because scientist in “general” are persistent, curious,\r\nprecise, intelligent, objective, honest, enthusiastic, and humble; (if their hypothesis is\r\nconfirmed right the first time.) Byrd-Bey: Well, brotha Olugbala we will wrap this interview up shortly, but let me say that it has\r\nbeen a tremendous blessing for myself to hear a lesson being taught... Nevertheless, Ihave two (2) final questions for you. How did you receive this chemistry that gives\r\nvaluable information? Olugbala: Ireceived this formula through cronyism = which means favoritism shown to old friends\r\nwithout regard for their qualifications. My good brotha-man Frank James-Bey, whom Ihonor\r\nfull-heartily, taught me much. So this Iattained from him; and through years of study. Byrd-Bey: Okay, we are now at the close of this interview, is there any good measure of last words\r\nthat you would like to say? Olugbala: Yes there is my brotha-man. Iemphasize this for the conscious ones, we must now go beyond\r\nelementary, we’re scientists the formula has been mixed with favorable\r\n“attributes” it’s time to confirm that we can be as valuable as any other\r\nculture of people. Learn that the advantages lieth not in possessing good things, but in\r\nthe knowing “to” use them. Think about this for years to come!

Like you’ve got the world in your hands, you walk erect, with a “S” on your chest, looking to shoot another human being. You’ll shoot a little boy, or girl, woman or man, it don’t matter, as long as you hear the clatter of your gun go boom. Now you’ve taken the life of someone’s wife, husband, sister, or brother. Now how would you feel if for a thrill someone killed your mother?, Father?, Sister?, Brother?, or child? Iknow, you’ll put your hand on the trigger and go buck wild! Some will call the cops, so they can cock their blocks to shoot the perpetrator down. Either way that’s another souljah that wont be around. Body count, two souljahs down, since they killed one of yours, you killed one of theirs, now neither one of you is around. Now Igot my hand on the trigger, but put your mind at ease, because my weapon of choice is my brain, so I’m shooting consciousness to anyone in need. Iknow Ican’t reach every soul that breathe, because some like my style, and try to be me. One can imitate my walk, use the words Italk, but they won’t feel what Ifeel, because a lost soul feel what they think they should, while what I’m feeling is real! My hand is on the trigger within the depth of my soul, because I’ve dismissed what was taught to me, to shoot what Iknow. Yeah, with my hand on the trigger Ifeel bigger, and my “S” stands for self, and I’m shooting consciousness to the souls Ican help. If you feel distress by the words Iexpress that’s another souljah down, because I’m gonna keep my hand on the trigger as long as I’m around! Estern Howard #871367 Haugville"}]}

It is the only Shi’a Muslim Islamic centre in Ireland including the Northern Ireland. Its aims and objectives are to serve the social , cultural and spritual needs of the entire Shi’a Muslim population\r\nof Ireland. There are about 1000 Shi’a Muslims working, studying and living in Ireland. Historical Background: The foundation of HUSSIANIA was laid down some time during the 1970’s by a\r\nfew Shi’a Muslim medical students, who came to Dublin from the Middle Eastern countries to study at the Royal College of surgeon, Dublin. These students hired a small house in the Portobello area of Dublin and then after a few years when this place was not big enough to accommodate every one, they moved to a bigger house in Rathgar. Gradually this place become known to other Shi'a Muslims living and working in Ireland. After a few years later even this house was not big enough to cater for the religious and spiritual needs of Irish Shi'a Muslim community. It was time to find a bigger and better space to serve properly the socio-cultural and religious needs of this small but growing Shi'a Muslim community of Ireland. During the 1990’s the local Irish Shi'a Muslim community\r\ndecided to build a proper Shi'a Muslim Islamic Center. They tapped on their own resources and constructed a purpose built center in the Milltown area of Dublin 14. Hussainia, Ahlul -Bait Shi'a Islamic Center was officially opened in September 1996. Afull time resident Imam- Sayyed Ali Abdullah decided to return to Ireland in order to assume his official duty as a religious head of this center. He is a noble and qualified\r\nShi’a Muslim religious scholar from the highest Muslim academic institution of Qum, Iran (known as Hawza ). The Imam of this Hussainia is not only responsible for the Islamic needs of the Shi'a Muslim community of Ireland but also anyone interested in the religion of Islam and Islamic world. Activity: The center is an active and thriving Islamic institution and is open every day for\r\nthe after noon and evening prayers (salaa) it also conducts Dua Kumayal (special supplication) on every Thursday after the evening prayers. The center regularly holds lectures on various Islamic topics and issues on every Saturday from 8 PM. These lectures are open to anyone wishes to come along and are free of charge. The center offers a Friday afternoon prayer a recommended ritual through out the Islamic world. It conducts special occasion ceremonies through out the year. The Shi’a Muslim Islamic calendar is full of such\r\nspecial occasions for example birth and death anniversaries of twelve Imams or Ahlul Bayt i.e. the family of Prophet Mohammed (p.b.u.h) and his progeny (Aimmah). The Fundamentals of Islam: Islam is a perfect code of life. In presenting this code of life, Islam provides\r\nboth for the formation of basic ideas and also for the implementing those ideas in to practice. For any one to become Muslim and believe in Islam one simply accept the following : KALEMA LA ILAHA ILLALLAH: There\r\nis no God but Allah MUHAMMADUN RASOOLULLAH: Our Prophet, Muhammad\r\nMustafa (Peace ofAllah be upon him) is the messenger of Allah. ALIYUN WALI-ULLAH: Imam Ali, the first Imam (Peace of Allah\r\nbe on him) is the guardian (Imam) appointed by Allah. WASI-O-RASOOLILAH: He (Imam Ali) is the rightful executor of\r\nthe will of the Prophet. Note: whenever we utter or hear the name of our\r\nProphet, we should say salawat. ( O Allah bless Muhammad\r\nand the Progeny of Muhammad) What is Islam? Islam consists of beliefs, which are the fundamental principals\r\n(roots) of the religion, and practices, which are the branches of the religion: Usool Al-Deen (Roots of the religion): Taw'heed (Oneness of GOD): Taw'heed means God is one. He\r\n        has neither a colleague nor a partner. He begets not, nor is He begotten, there is non\r\n        like Him. Adl (Justice of GOD): It means that Got is Just. He will\r\n        reward or punish any person according to his deeds. Nobo'wa (Prophethood): A Nabi (prophet ) excels all other\r\n        person for whom he is sent by Allah. He is Masoom ( sinless). PROPHIT MUHAMMAD\r\n        MUSTAFA(blessings of Allah be on him and his progeny) is the last of the Prophets sent by\r\n        Him. The Prophets sent by Allah including our Prophet, totals one hundred and twenty-four\r\n        thousand. Imama (Vicegerncy of the prophet): Nobo'wa (prophethood)\r\n        ended with Prophet Muhammad (pbum). The Imam has his Knowledge from GOD and his verdict is\r\n        the verdict of GOD. Imams are twelve and they are the only rightful Imams. There is no\r\n        successor to the Twelfth Imam . He is Alive but invisible in accordance with the will of\r\n        Allah and will reappear when he commands, which will signify the coming end of the World. Qiyama (The judgment day): Is the day when GOD brings all\r\n        of us to life after death, in order to be judged on what we did in our lives. Foroo'e Al-Deen (Branches of the\r\n    religion): Salat (Prayers): In Islam, there are five prayers that each\r\n        muslim must perform each day. Sa wm (Fasting): Each year,\r\n        muslims fast the month of Ramadan. Fasting begins from dawn to dusk. Alms (Zakat). The One-Fifth Tax (Khums): Haj (Pilgrimage): Every muslim must visit Macca, at least\r\n        once in his/her life, to perform certain practices. Jihad (Holy war): Which is a must on every able male muslim\r\n        in case of defending his Islamic country. Al-Amr Bil'ma'aroof (Advising other people): Every muslim\r\n        has the obligation to advise and teach other muslims if he/she see something wrong is\r\n        done. Al-Nahi An Al-Monkar (Preventing Evil): Every muslim has\r\n        the duty to prevent other muslims from committing sins and evil deeds. Al-Ta'wali Li Aw'liya'a Allay (Loving the Infaliables): Loving the Infaliables means admitting their leadership to all humans, and they are the\r\n        only viable source that can interpret the Holy Qor'an. Al-Ta'bari Min A'ada'a Allah (Avoiding and hating GOD's enemies)."}]}

Along, polished bar stretches out before the far wall, its back wall shelves littered\r\nwith bottles, jars, boxes, and tiny tins, as well as a large brass moon, similar to the one over the\r\noutside door. Anumber of low tables lie scattered about before the bar, with pillows set around\r\nthem for seats. Beaded curtains lead to a number of side rooms, which appear to be lounges of\r\nsome sort, with pillows scattered about the rooms for reclining upon. Anarrow spiral staircase\r\nleads to an upper floor.\r\n    As the sun begins to sink away behind the near inner wall of the city, the red and violet panes\r\nof glass along the walls slowly fall dark. The bartender casually sets aglow a number of small\r\ncandles nestled within decorative red jars. Afew young women sit in one corner of the room,\r\ntaking turns at inhaling cool, pale smoke from a hooka. Several older women hold a lively\r\nconversation in one of the side rooms, while nibbling on tiny pastries.\r\n\r\n(August)\r\n     Startling emerald eyes flash brightly from a face carved of slightly flushed mahogany, as\r\nringlets of long midnight hair frame an aquiline nose, high cheekbones and a smile of polished\r\nivory. Two golden hoops dangle from the man's left ear. The neatly trimmed fringe beard\r\nexaggerates the squareness of his jawline.\r\n     He moves with a feline grace and his voice is deep and vibrant.\r\n     Atabard of soft brown leather scales studded with bronze is stretched tight against August's\r\nbroad chest and dangles to his knees. Under the tabard is worn a blousey silk tunic of brilliant\r\ngreen and sheer black leggings tucked into knee high boots of soft black leather.\r\n     Around bronze pauldron, embossed with a stylized phoenix, gleams at August's right\r\nshoulder. From it to his left hip is slung a wide swordbelt of black leather from which depends a\r\nwickedly curved sabre. Padding and decorating the swordbelt is a fringed sash of bright greens\r\nand dazzling golds.\r\n     The pauldron also clasps an ebon cloak of silk-lined serge which drapes from his right\r\nshoulder. The fingers of August's right hand glitter with rings of precious stones and metals.\r\n\r\nAfew men are leaning in the more shadowy corners, in grubby pale clothing, sipping from bowls\r\nof tea.\r\n\r\nYou paged August with 'Are you just wandering in blind, or have you been putting out word that\r\nyou want to \"talk\"?'.\r\n\r\nAugust enters briskly, smiling and nods familiarly to Jeskha. His bright smile dims, but doesn't\r\nfade as he notes the grubby men drinking tea. Walking towards the bar he flicks his cloak casually\r\nover his shoulder.\r\n\r\nAugust pages: Sorta blind..have IC reasons to look into you gentlemen...but haven't put out any\r\nword.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the men follow him, but they make no move as yet.\r\n\r\nAugust sits down at the bar.\r\n\r\nOne mutters to another, low-voiced, and makes a twisting gesture with his hand.\r\n\r\nAugust speaks softly to Jeskha, and she whirls away into the storerooms for a moment. Eyes\r\nflickering to the long mirror over the bar, August settles comfotably into his stool.\r\n\r\nEventually the first man rises, and approaches August, soft-footed. He folds his hands and bows.\r\n\"Gracious jewelled peacock, a moment of your time.\"\r\n\r\nJeskha returns with a bottle of strange liquor and fetches a glass from behind the bar, filling it as\r\nshe nervously watches the exchange. The Peacock turns slowly on his stool to face the man, his\r\nmouth streched in a thin smile. He nods. \"Of course, what can Ido for you, my good man?\"\r\n\r\nHe bows again. \"Ispeak of matters of interest to all men, noble lynx upon the prowl. Matters of\r\nfaith.\"\r\n\r\nAugust nods, eye's twinkling. \"An odd place, one might think, for such a topic. But such matters\r\ndo get my attention at times. Please, will you join me?\"\r\n\r\nThe man shakes his head. \"Ihad rather stand, noble sir. My questions are few enough: are you\r\ntrue and faithful to the truth?\"\r\n\r\nAugust inhales slowly, and nods. \"Indeed.\"\r\n\r\nHe nods, with an air of satisfaction. \"Do you acknowledge the Unicorn?\"\r\n\r\nAugust nods a second time. \"That Ido.\"\r\n\r\nThe man folds his hands and bows again. \"Faithful one. Are you against the Whore of Chaos?\"\r\n\r\nThe corner of August's mouth twiches slightly, his smile subdued but his eyes alight yet with good\r\nhumor. \r\n\r\nAugust says \"Ican't say as I've met her, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes darken. \"Irefer to the Whore of the Lords of Chaos, the Shifter in the guise of the\r\nRightful Queen who sits above this city, most noble peacock of the sunset.\"\r\n\r\nAugust pages: How many of you?\r\n\r\nYou paged August with 'Two or three in the corners, plus the one questioning you.'.\r\n\r\nAugust pages: Thanks :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAugust's eyes flash angrily. \"I'm sure Imisunderstand you sir. Is it our place to doubt the\r\nUnicorn's wisdom is choosing who rules here? Do you think the Queen could attain such a place\r\nif it was against the wishes of the Unicorn?\"\r\n\r\nThe man hesitates. \"It is well known that women are by nature devious and treacherous.\" His\r\nvoice becomes more certain. \"It is our place to act for the course of righteousness, as directed by\r\nthe Illuminated One.\"\r\n\r\nAugust shrugs. \"Ido not find it my place to second guess the nature or will of the divine. Iam a\r\nbut a man, and know my vantage point is low.\"\r\n\r\nAnother man in the corner finishes his tea, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nThe first man bows again. \"It is our hope that you will find the truth, jewelled peacock of the\r\ndawn.\"\r\n\r\nAugust takes the glass from the bar, then sets it down and returns his attention to the nearest man.\r\n\"What wisdom has the Illuminated One imparted to you? As Iam clearly impoverished in spiritual\r\npossessions, Iwould humbly ask for you to share this with me.\"\r\n\r\nThe man preens slightly. \"He has revealed to us the protection of the Unicorn upon her humble\r\nchildren, and set us to share this truth with others.\"\r\n\r\nAugust smiles, warming slightly. \"Ah, perhaps a blessing is visited upon us? What form does this\r\nprotection take? Or is it occult and beyond the sight of common men?\"\r\n\r\nThe man makes a twisting gesture before his forehead. \"It is of the soul. We shall sit in glory.\"\r\n\r\nAugust nods slowly. \"If a man wished to meet with this voice of the Unicorn, this Illuminated one,\r\nwhere would he travel?\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitates. \"Word may perhaps be taken, jewelled one.\"\r\n\r\nAugust stands slowly, his drink forgotten. He smiles. \"Ipray you send word to him for me, a\r\nmessage can be left here, Ishall surely receive it. My name is Sir August.\"\r\n\r\nThe man bows one last time. \"It shall be done. The Unicorn watch over you, jewelled peacock.\"\r\n\r\nAugust nods. \"And you as well, my friend.\"\r\n\r\nHe turns, and drifts towards the door, and is gone.\r\n\r\nJeskha shakes her head in annoyance, and August notes her at last. He produces a few coins and\r\nsets them on the counter. He turns towards the door."}]}

However this laptop has only 512 of RAM (rather painful for compiling) and Ihad heard that Kubuntu has good laptop support. And indeed thats pretty much the case. All of my hardware was recognized: the dual-core, the wireless, the Intel graphics chip and power saving and status features are all working without any configuration. It was the easiest install I've ever done. And I'm happy with the result too, Kubuntu does a good job of putting everything together. The complaints I'm about to go into don't take away too much from this fact. The problem with Kubuntu and Ubuntu are their defaults for the repos. I'm pretty sure the fact that the default repos get better support then the 'universe' 'multiverse' etc. repos is something that is only understood by only a few. And apparently thats the entire reason for not having them on by default. So when Iwanted to install kdevelop, Iwas a little puzzled at first. Gentoo currently shines in this area, I've  only ever had to use an \"overlay\" if Iwanted to install unreleased software. The other issue I've had is with wireless network configuration (at least its not wireless driver configuration!) If there's a Kubuntu equivalent to Gentoo's /etc/conf.d/wireless Ihaven't found it. Right now wireless works if Irun wlassistant (a GUI interface to configure the wireless) try to connect, it fails, and then Irestart /etc/init.d/networking. That doesn't make too much sense, Iknow. In general their startup scripts seem to be all pretty unorganized. All written in plain /bin/sh and with no clear design (like instead of a general dependency system, there are scripts that are run before and after specifically network goes up and down). Gentoo's startup and configuration system is hardly revolutionary which Isuppose makes Kubuntu's antiquated system that much more frustrating."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "x2x"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "x2x is a cool little utility.

{"file_number": "80", "plaintext": [{"tag": "h2", "text": "What Ideonomy Can Do"}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Advance the Foundations of A Subject"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Our knowledge of the logical and natural foundations of many field is\nslight, or at least dubious or imperfect. Certainly subjects differ\ndrastically in the relative strength of their foundations, or in the\napparent fundamentality of their concepts, methods, principles,\ntheories, achievements, research, language, logic, etc. Ideonomy can compare the foundations of different disciplines to\ndiscover analogies, differences, commonalities, interdependences, contradictions,\nredundancies, interpenetrations, convergences, common goals and needs,\nunities, etc. It can use these to suggest omissions, errors, common\nopportunities for research or discovery, ways to redescribe the foundations\nof one subject in terms of the foundations of another, reciprocal problems\nand fallacies, equivalent principles and entities, joint ignorance, new\ntests and experiments, higher standards, useful priorities, strategies\nof theory, etc. It can suggest ways in which to combine or transform certain concepts\nor dimensions so as to generate or define 'all' possible or important concepts\nor things, or the spaces and manifolds thereof. Contained or implicit within\nsuch sets, spaces, and manifolds may be concepts or other things that can\nsupplement or deepen the foundations of the subject to which they pertain. Moreover, examining or merely experiencing such enlarged perspectives\nupon what is possible may lead to the realization that what has been taken\nto be fundamental within a subject is not really fundamental; or at least,\nthat the foundations--or supposed foundations--of the subject are not as\nfree of assumptions, problems, inelegant features, superfluous elements,\ndiscrepancies, idiosyncratic aspects, etc as has been thought. Since ideonomy seeks to discover all of those natural concepts, dimensions,\nrepresentations, entities, phenomena, laws, principles, relationships,\netc that are supremely universal, fundamental, important, essential,\nminimal, logical, generative, necessary, transcendental, and pantological,\nit is in a privileged position to advance the foundations of arbitrary\nfields. It is in fact a principal goal of ideonomy to make all sciences more\nscientific, and among the best ways of doing this are by rectifying, enlarging,\nand extending the foundations of these subjects. There is a hint that ideonomy may be on the verge of discovering some\nunsuspected category of being that is more fundamental than either ideas\nor things, or that transcends what is meant by both the \"mental\" and \"physical''\naspects of reality. By placing all of the things and phenomena in a subject upon basic scales--as\nof duration, time, Population, importance, complexity, or entropy--ideonomy\ncan call the mind's attention to what is only naturally the most and least\nfundamental in a subject, to the way in which things derive their greater\nor lesser fundamentality from one another, to the direction in which that\nwhich is truly or most fundamental is apt to be found, or to the properties\nthat fundamentals or foundations are likely to or must have. Knowledge or theory of the foundations of many subjects is impaired\nby a conscious or unconscious failure to identify, define, characterize,\nor emphasize the most fundamental, central, or final topic, concept, phenomenon,\nsubstance, law, entity, goal, or the like of the subject (or the set of\nsuch things). Then again, the supreme topic or whatever may have some terrible\nunsolved problem or difficulty associated with it. Thus the supreme concern of physics is no longer clear, the arch concern\nof sociology is in dispute, the goal of psychology is in flux, the essential\nnature or defining properties of life are unknown to the science of life\n(or to biology), and even the basic object of study of mathematics (it\ncannot be number , though the nature of number is an enigma in any\ncase), cosmology (what is the described or effable 'universe' itself a part of?), and ideonomy ( ideas , as hinted above, may not be sufficiently\nfundamental) is mysterious. Ideonomy can be used to define concepts in new and ever more fundamental\nways, and it has already been used to define life, or to reduce it to a\nset of ninety-two fundamental properties. The set of 8,464 possible dyadic\ncombinations of the primary properties have demonstrated such extraordinary\ninterest that they promise to revolutionize theoretical biology, something\nwhich at once illustrates the importance of clarifying fundamentals and\nsuggests that the traits that were used to define the phenomenon of \"life\"\nwere indeed fundamental. On the other hand, the same bit of ideonomic research also highlighted\nthe problems that plague all efforts to resolve fundamentals or to get\nat the genuine foundations of a subject; for it was found that the same\nset of ninety-two basic properties of \"life\" have either analogs or exact\nequivalents in the supposedly inanimate phenomena of subjects other than\nbiology. Thus forms or analogs of procreation, natural selection, and evolution\neither may or do exist in fields such as physical chemistry, geology, psychology,\nand cosmology. The implication may variously be that life is not limited\nor peculiar to biology, that life must be otherwise defined or defined\nvia other properties, that the essential phenomena of biology should include\nmore than organisms, or that biology should be recast into a superscience\nincorporating many other sciences or that--like mathematics--applies to\nall science. An old way of advancing the foundations of a subject is by improving,\nformalizing, or axiomatizing its logic; and a new or just now emerging\nway, by giving the subject cognitive form, which means the form of thought\nitself. Ideonomy can help with both of these approaches, particularly in\nconjunction with computer software and hardware. Erect Frameworks For Thought To think about anything one needs some manner of conceptual framework,\na schema upon which to hang ideas or in which to develop, interweave, and\nexperiment upon different concepts. Ideonomy, in effect, can enable such conceptual schemes, structures,\nand systems to be mass produced; it can widen their scope, diversify them,\nenhance their power, increase their connectivity or interrelatedness, greaten\ntheir mobility within and between fields, enlarge their rationality or\nmake their logic more explicit, give the individual the power to freely\nmanipulate them, etc. The concept of mental frameworks is so important to ideonomy\nthat it needs to be expanded upon. By it we mean an open-ended set of :\nschemes, structures, systems, and 'machines' of : ideas, relations,\nprinciples, presuppositions, facts, arguments, thoughts, beliefs, values,\npurposes, perspectives, methods, strategies, gestalts, analyses, attitudes,\npercepts, images, definitions, explanations, dimensions, symbols, criteria,\nrepresentations, models, heuristics, postulates, generalizations, theories,\nprocedures, wisdoms, stories, memories, analogies, rules, mental associations,\netc : serving or for furthering thought. Such mental schematizations of : experience, the environment,\nreality, behavior, human existence, or possibility : can be : conscious\nor unconscious : formal or informal : specific, general, or universal ad\nhoc or perpetual (evolutionary) : deductive or inductive : empirical\nor theoretical : categorical or experimental : developing or inert : etc. The diverse values and uses of cognitive frameworks include :\nmental simplification; clustering, grouping, and classifying of ideas and\nfacts; explication and coordination of different purposes and goals; structuring\nof memories in hierarchies, series, networks, trees, vergences, rings or\ncycles, foliations, meta-stories, etc-that are especially dynamic, powerful,\nnatural, efficient, dense, optimal, etc; recursive, self-developing, nucleative,\nand self-correcting properties or effects; the multidimensional mental\nparallax given by a multitude-of such frameworks; provision of a stable\napparatus for developing and maintaining mental skills; standardization\nwithin the mind ( à la worldwide industrial and scientific\nstandardization); provision of bases for tests, evaluations, investigations,\nand experiments; limitation of thought to what is necessary and obviation\nof trivial and repetitive thought and creativity; bases for communication\namong different minds and for comparisons of their contents; enabling of\nmore precise and rigorous thought; codification of though! acceleration\nof thought; enabling of overviews of experience, the world, one's conduct,\nand the mind; greater mental flexibility and self-control; readier learning;\nquick or more powerful structuring of materials, subjects, problems, or\nsituations; automation of mental habits and of ideation; heightened clarity\nof mind; etc. Frameworks for thought can enable a topic to be taught, mastered, or\ntreated more deeply or completely. They can provide clues for probing the\nnature of a thing. They can enable more imaginative or less prejudiced\nthought. They can help one to prepare for a more serious intellectual endeavor.\nThey can help one relate one perspective to another, or permit one to grasp\na new thing by analogy to an old or familiar thing. Enumerate the Functions of\nA Thing Things may, and usually do, have far more numerous and diverse functions,\nroles, and importances than people realize or would even imagine. If\nthis is true, it has great significance: Features of our world may be carelessly eliminated or altered by the\nignorant march of progress or change; All existing things may have a web\nof ecological relationships that merit study and respect; Things may all\nbe beneficiaries of many more things than has been thought; There may be\nan unsuspectedly great number of ways to change and improve the world or\nits things; etc. Among the possible generic functions of things are : Mediation;\nPrevention; Protection; Connection; Transportation; Communication; Symbolization;\nTesting; Facilitation; Amplification; Imitation or substitution; Extension;\nGeneralization; Specialization; Correction; Improvement; Balancing; Sublimation\nor domestication; Counteraction; Elimination; Supplementation; Complementation;\nExploitation; Coping; Hiding or deception; Showing; Production; Concentration\nor confinement; Combination or integration; Separation, division, or liberation;\nOrdering; Maintenance or supply; Storage, holding, preservation, or conservation;\nPreparation; Initiation; Control or management; Adjustment or modulation;\nTranscendence, circumvention, or obviation; Orientation; Reduction or economization\n(enhancement of efficiency); Transformation; Etc. Ideonomy can help answer such questions about functions as: How do functions overlap? What functions are competitive? What functions are cooperative, complementary,\nor synergistic? What functions are illusory, misleading, or ambiguous? What are all of the degrees of functions of things? What are the maximal,\nminimal, and optimal functions of things? What are all of the intermediate\nfunctions of things? What functions are absolute or relative? What makes them absolute or\nrelative? What are all of the ways in which they are absolute and relative?\nWhat are all of the absolute and relative functions of a thing? What functions conflict with, contradict, or negate what other functions? How do things acquire--and lose--their functions? How do or could functions\noriginate, develop, evolve, diminish, or disappear? How do different functions compare? What are all of the ways of comparing\nall functions? What functions are identical, equivalent, analogous, or\nrelated to what other functions? What functions differ or diverge from,\nor are opposite to, what other functions? What are all of the degrees,\nbases, circumstances, and implications of these things? What are not the functions of things, and what functions do not exist\nor are impossible? What are all of the generic and specific : properties, dimensions, elements,\nmechanisms, effects, signs, manifestations, criteria, etc of all\ngeneric and specific functions ? What functions are arbitrary or necessary? What functions are artificial\nor natural? What are the degrees and causes of these things? How can the : prediction, classification, recognition, examination,\nevaluation, explanation, creation, development, application or use, intercorrelation,\nsynthesis, differentiation, description, definition, modification, control\nor government, etc : of the functions of arbitrary things be mechanized\nand automated in the future , when the needed technology and methodology\nemerges7 How can different functions, and different species and genera of functions,\nbe combined to synthesize novel, desirable, or arbitrary functions--or\nsystems of functions--or to enlarge, transform, or relocate old functions? What functions of familiar or known things have been neglected ,\nforgotten about, or overlooked? What are the idiosyncrasies of the\nways in which people in general, or certain groups of people, classify,\nperceive, rank, or utilize the classes of functions of classes of things?\nWhat is good, bad, or simply significant about these idiosyncrasies? What are the characteristic and comparative ratios of our ignorance\nabout to our knowledge about different (key or comprehensive) functions\nof different (key or comprehensive) things in different (key or comprehensive)\nsituations? What are all possible or important categories of ignorance and knowledge\nabout functions? What are the actual extent, qualities, and forms of our\nignorance, knowledge, and skills within each of these vergent categories?\nWhat are the total-known or hypothesizable--costs, values, consequences,\nand implications thereof? In what meta-structures : series, networks, hierarchies, trees,\nlattices, rings, circuitries, vergences, knots, line-clumps, 'crystals'\n(e.g. of intersecting hyperdimensional planes or curved surfaces), plexures,\n'soils', matrixes, clusters, 'blobs', conoids, helicoids, aegagropilas\nor Peano curves, 'onions', fractals, chaoses, paths, 'catastrophes', tessellations\nor 'jigsaw puzzles', topological monsters, etc : do or could functions : exist, originate, operate, interact, develop, metamorphose, vanish, combine,\ncoalesce, reproduce, cooriginate, coevolve, invert, exhibit singularities,\netc? How do such meta-structures themselves : behave, associate, interact,\nevolve, originate, function, etc? How could or must the meta-structures of functions be used to describe,\nexplain, discover, manipulate, create, alter, etc : particular or arbitrary\nfunctions? What are all the particular or recurrent : goods, bads, defects,\nimperfections, limitations, etc.: of all functions of all things ? What are all known or possible functions of a single, particular or\nrandom, thing--and how are they structured inter se ? Conversely, what are all of the actual or possible things that have\nor could have a single, random or specific, function? What do they have\nor not have in common, that explains or relates to their shared function--or\nthat does not do so? What are all of the self-functions of things? What set of questions should be asked when treating functions? How should\nthey be ranked in relative importance? In what order should they be asked-or\nset of orders, depending on particular circumstances? What explains their\ndiverse importance? Which of these questions are and are not currently\nasked; or how efficient is the asking and answering of these questions?\nWhat decision-tree should govern the use of these questions, and what are\nits proper and possible anastomoses? What are the ways in which some of\nthe questions can and should be iterated? As results piled up worldwide from the habitual, ubiquitous, and standardized\nuse of such an encyclopedic, all-purpose, or universal questionary, how\ncould they be systematically and efficiently compiled, collated, colligated,\npromulgated, and exploited? Illustrative examples of functions include the function or functions\nof : Telephones in creating commercial nexuses; Human skin\nmicroflora in (hypothetically) preempting sites upon which pathogens\ncan establish themselves and from which the pathogens can invade the macrosymbiontic\nbody; Ball bearings in minimizing frictional contacts of overpassing\nsurfaces; Lightning in maintaining biogeochemical cycles and (by\ndeflagrating forests and prairies) ecological successions; Clowns in lighting up the hearts of children; Taverns in sublimating life's\nhorrors; Axons of neurons in shuttling and multiplying data in the\nbrain; Grammar in inducing neural impulses, data, or patterns to\norganize themselves into vergent hierarchies in the brain; Expletives in dissipating, condensing, or civilizing excessive emotions; Sidewalks in keeping pedestrians and children off streets-and cars off the former; Marriage in stabilizing, reproducing, and subdividing society; Rugs in simulating grass, creating thermal barriers (conserving heat or coolness),\nand stopping sound (perfectirig-privacy); Buildings' foundations in stabilizing and economizing frames; Spiders' webs in trapping\nflying, hopping, and climbing insects who do not notice them or who mistake\nthem for stems, giving their creators' midair nests inaccessible by lumbrous\npredators, and telegraphically or resonantly forewarning their seismoceptive\noccupants of the approach of more funambulatory enemies; Cloud cover in regulating terrestrial insolation and Earth's albedo--and hence in stabilizing\nclimate to the advantage, or conceivably in the Gaian service, of the bios; Money in mediating, stabilizing, equalizing, universalizing, codifying,\nrecording, rationalizing, virtualizing, coordinating, lubricating, temporally\nbroadening, quantizing, algebraizing ( sensu making more perfectly\ndistributive, associative, transitive, commutative, etc), institutionalizing,\nformalizing, unifying, mechanizing, 'vocalizing', 'intellectualizing',\netc the exchange of goods and services; Cosmetics in role-playing,\nseduction, intrasexual competition, feminization, and beautification of\nthe social landscape; Maps in collation, abstraction, and communication\nof geographic data; Roots in recovering rainwater from the sponge-like\nsoil; Stars in manufacturing larger atoms and animating planets\n(or at least one planet); Windows in half-admitting the outdoors\ninto buildings; Rulers, in quantizing the dimensions of objects; Dolls in preparing children for adult life, as surrogate parents,\nand as mirrors enabling kids to look upon themselves or to explore the\nworlds of intersubjectivity; Glue as an ersatz nail (at once cheap,\nnondestructive, hammer-less, all-size, always-singular, etc); Genes in remembering, immortalizing, transmuting, and 'generalizing' organisms; Etc. Many things can be done to functions; they can be : Enlarged or\ndiminished; Multiplied and diversified-or the reverse; Created or or ended;\nBroadened or narrowed; Sophisticated or simplified; Connected or disconnected;\nIntegrated or unified; Differentiated within or from other functions; Obviated;\nTemporarily suspended; Redirected or realigned; Molded or modified; Replaced\nby others; Relocated or rearranged with respect to other functions; Extended\nto include other things; Combined; Permuted; Transelemented; Redefined;\nFacilitated; Perpetuated; Perfected; Fixed (frozen); Slowed or quickened;\nElevated or reduced in importance -or made central or peripheral; Modulated;\nEtc. Foster Wisdom About the Future There are many ways in which one could be wise or wiser about the\nfuture ; e.g. one could simply attend to it more closely, or\nappreciate better the fleeting nature of the present or of things as they\nnow are; one could systematically examine the range of future possibilities ;\none could visualize the various alternative courses the world might\ntake in the future, and the things apt to determine which\nparticular set of courses the world will actually follow; one could identify the world's needs in advancing into the future, and endeavor to provide for those needs and wants; one could help to educate all present and future humanity to deal with the future; one could attempt\nto influence the actual course the world will take tomorrow, or\nto push it toward what would be good and away from what would be evil or\ninferior; one could labor to produce general methods for foreseeing\nor altering the future; etc. Of course the future being referred to need not be that of the world\nas a whole or represented by the future in its entirety, but on the contrary\nmight be arbitrarily modest: one's own future lifetime, perhaps, or tomorrow's\nevents or the events of the next minute, or the momentary or instantaneous\noutcome of a scientific experiment that someone is performing or whose\nperformance is simply being contemplated. Becoming wiser about the future might mean nothing more than divesting\noneself of prejudicial ideas, attitudes, beliefs, or world views, becoming\nfriendlier--or more hostile--to innovation, reducing the irrational inertia\nof institutions, or paying more attention to the patterns and lessons of\nhistory that might be analogous or relevant to the future. Among the fallacies that diminish wisdom about the future, and that\nideonomy could help to combat, are that : the future will simply repeat\nthe past; the course of the future is predetermined and inalterable; the\nworld of the present represents the best of all possible worlds; human\nknowledge and wisdom are nearly complete and perfect--and our ignorance\nsmall and unimportant; the future is too complex or esoteric for us to\nanticipate its character or possibilities--and past failures and inability\nto correctly foresee the future were unavoidable, and should be looked\nupon as a warning that all prophecy is folly; etc. Ideonomy could be used to : devise new, or suggest all possible,\nmethods for studying future possibilities; survey, describe, compare, evaluate,\ncriticize, correct, extend, integrate, and transcend all past and present prophetic methods, endeavors, and results; identify the totality of things\nthat can or should have their future possibilities considered; predict\nthe future interrelationships and interactions of these things; indicate\nthe future's most fundamental dimensions, structure, forces, elements,\npatterns, laws, etc; formulate principles for treating the future; develop\nnovel means for representing and dramatizing the future's possibilities\n(e.g. diagrams, organons, computer software and simulations new types of\nbooks, special language and idea spaces, artificial intelligence programs,\netc); suggest all possible causes, effects, and conditions of future possibilities;\nrank the relative and absolute probability and importance of all future\npossibilities; indicate the different roles and functions that things are\napt to have in the future; and so forth. Some of the specific questions and other issues that ideonomy could\nhelp to address are : What should be maximized and minimized in the\nfuture? What new rights may become political issues in the future? What\nhuman freedoms must ultimately be restrained for the good of all? What\npresent concerns of government will be retired and what new concerns will\ntake their place? What means are there for maximizing the future diversity\nand complexity of civilization? What were the laws of history, insofar\nas they apply to the future as well? How ambiguous is the future or are\nits possibilities? What meta-structures are applicable to the study of\nthe future or will actually describe its possibilities: incl. chains, series,\ntrees, networks, hierarchies, vergences, etc? What elements of the present\nwill disappear or endure in the future? What new discoveries, inventions,\ncreations, and other innovations are possible, probable, or certain in\nthe future? What developments can continue ad infinitum and which\nmust have limits? In what ways is the future apt to surprise us? What are\nall the future possibilities of a single, random or particular, thing?\nWhat future possibilities would be synergistic or antagonistic? In what\norder must different things happen? Illustrative examples of specific future possibilities are : Elimination\nof the need for sleep; Chinese democratic revolution; Life discovered elsewhere\nin the cosmos; Legalization of prostitution; Replacement of stores by teleshopping\nand robotized delivery of goods to homes; Evolution of a single panhuman\nlanguage; Reduction of physics to 'pure' logic; New age of dirigibles;\nExploration of a single cave 'pushed' to 100,000 kilometers (using miniature\nhumanoid teleoperators); Mechanical pets and computer- simulated plants\nmore popular than biological organisms; Family car replaced by a flying\nequivalent; irrefutable scientific proof of the existence of 'God'; Temporal\nmetric system adopted; War fought using beams of elementary particles so\nexotic that they have not yet been imagined; Time's apparently unique and\nirreversible flow shown to be a physical illusion; Mining of Earth's mantle;\nEvery organism on Earth transformed into a different species; New human\nsexes added to the traditional two; Complete obsolescence of the family;\nLamps made to last centuries; immortality made compulsory; Ethics remade\ninto an exact science; Deliberate suicide of the human race, subjectively\nrendered irrelevant by its own transhuman mechanical creations; Ideonomy\ntaught at all grade levels in all schools; War everywhere ended by the\nintroduction of \"peace pills\" (irenic psychopharmaceuticals); Etc. Generalize Notions One can use ideonomy to help to generalize or even universalize any\nand all notions and things. Over time things often prove to be insufficiently generalized. That\nis, the essential idea or set of ideas associated with them turn out to\nhave greater meaning, scope, or application than what is initially --or\nperhaps than is ever at any finite moment--thought to be the case. Actually it is probably true that in some sense the generality of all\nconcepts, and all concepts of things, must always be at once inadequate\nand excessive. But according to an ideonomic principle it is of the utmost importance\nthat the generality of all concepts constantly be enlarged over time, or\nadvanced toward infinity. Naturally in the course of such progressive generalization\nthe concepts will undergo fundamental metamorphoses, yet a form of semantic\ncontinuity may be apparent in retrospect that was prospectively invisible\nor even meaningless. It could be said that all concepts are inherently infinite in meaning,\nand even that this infinite aspect is close to their essence. To generalize - according to the dictionary - is to make general reduce\nto general laws : give a general form to; to derive or induce (a general\nconception or principle) from particulars; to derive or induce a general\nconception, principle, or inference from; to make general (as by existential\nor universal qualification) : render applicable to a wider class; to give\ngeneral applicability to; to modify or eliminate (nonessential details)\nfor emphasizing some particular feature; to portray or emphasize general\nrather than particular features and characteristics of. Illustrative examples of generalizations of ideas and things :\nHistorically, the generalization of the legal concept of a person to include corporations and other organizations, even though these contain\nmany human beings; Energy has been generalized to include mass;\nSome quantum physicists would generalize the concept of a physical phenomenon to include the apparatus used to measure the phenomenon, the observer,\nor even the observational or mensurational act; Afew physicists would\ngo even further, and define any phenomenon as perforce including\nthe whole universe or all of spacetime; Certain modern composers generalize\nthe notion of musical scale to include any systematic or recurrent\narrangement of notes on which a composition is based; The concept of intelligence has been generalized to include animals that were formerly regarded as\nmindless; Skeletal and muscular systems have been generalized to\ninclude the cytoskeleton and other purely intracellular systems and structures;\nAnalogous generalization of the nervous system to include equivalents\nin unicellular organisms--and perhaps plants--may be imminent; Concepts\nof star and galaxy should perhaps be generalized to include one\nanother--since stars (as superstars) may equal or exceed (dwarf) galaxies\nin size; The progressive generalization of the concept of number in the\nhistory of mathematics to ever more abstract, strange ' numerous, and 'less\nnumber-like' things (imaginary numbers being one of the more famous products\nof this process); Over history the concept of evolution has become\never more generalized--to embrace not only biology (life; the phylogeny\nof species, ontogeny of bionts, and life-long biosynthesis of molecules,\norganelles, etc) but geology (Earth and other planets; the evolution of\ncontinents, mountains, geospheres, etc), astronomy (stars, galaxies perhaps,\nand the universe as a whole), physics (matter, energy, space, time, physical\nlaws and constants perhaps, etc), society, industry, economies, the mind,\nethics, the arts, etc; Mental illness has been generalized to include\nnormal mental states and individuals (on the belief that the difference\nis only one of degree, perspective, or concern)--and mental normality has been generalized to include mental illness (e.g. based on the belief\nthat the latter may be rational, coherent, or productive when viewed internally,\nfrom a different or larger perspective, or with an awareness that society\nis universally illogical and insane); Learning might be generalized\nto include selective forgetting, unlearning, and progressive inhibition;\nThe concepts of publishing, book, and magazine can be generalized\nto include novel forms and products of electronic publishing; The concept\nof color might be generalized to include the static and dynamic\nmeanings of pseudocolors in different or all possible situations--or simply\nto perceptual and cognitive patterns apparent in temporal successions\nand combinations of regular colors; Over the course of history the\nconcept or subject of science has broadened unremittingly, to the extent\nthat it now includes the study of: art qua aesthetics, musicology,\nphilology, etc.; money, wealth, and economic systems qua economics;\ngovernments and governance qua political science; reasoning and\nintelligence qua logic and cognitive science; battle and peace qua military science; techniques and engineering qua technology; society qua sociology; history qua historiology; the psyche qua psychology; ideas qua ideonomy; administration qua management science; language and languages qua linguistics; forms qua morphology; chance qua stochastics; science itself qua metascience; farming qua agriculture; etc; Etc . Examples of things that may have been inadequately generalized or\nthat may be generalized in the future: Humor : If precursors, rudiments', theriomorphic variants, or\nanalogs of laughter or a risibles are eventually found in animals other\nthan man, generalization of the concept or phenomenon of humor (its origin,\nfunctions, mechanisms, types, properties, referents, states, logics, degrees,\nscope, etc) may turn out to be desirable or necessary; Machine : The concept of a machine may have to be generalized\nso as to include biological phenomena (e.g. genomes, protein molecules,\nmicelles, organelles, cells, organs, biochemical networks and processes,\nbodily macro- systems such as the nervous and immune systems, organisms,\necosystems, and the hypothetically Gaian bios), various phenomena and entities\nin pure and applied mathematics--or even logic, chemical reactions, crystals,\ndiversely intelligent computers; models, simulations, and even scientific\ntheories; human languages and computer programs; geological and meteorological\nphenomena such as volcanoes and storms, the 'universe', man's mind or society,\npure or real-world ideas, physical laws, statistical and quantum phenomena\nin physics, economic systems, political ideologies, ethical systems, and\nsymphonies; Food : This should include 'nutritive' atmospheric gases; conceivably\norganisms get some genes or genic influences directly from food (via \"lateral\ngene flow\"); the body is forever 'consuming itself' (in strange and little-\nknown senses); even inanimate phenomena 'eat' or require 'nutrition' from\ntheir environment; conceivably the seemingly stable and self-existent macroscopic\nworld, with its delomorphic baryons and leptons, is in reality being dynamically\nmaintained and replenished from below, or by chains, fountains, singularities,\nplexiform or vergent hierarchies, or the like ascending from the ultramicroscopic\nlevel of zero-point, Bore], Dirac- vacuum, Wheeler-prespace, or Bohm-implicate\norder fluctuations; and the mind 'eats' ideas; House : This concept should be generalized to include the diverse\nhomes (-nests, burrows, cavities, interstices, webs, mounds, hollow trees,\nlogs, host exteriors and interiors, atmospheric dust and cloud particles,\netc) of all organisms; shells, exoskeletons, skin, bodies, the skull and\nblood-brain barrier, etc; cells, plasmalemmas, misc. membranes, etc; ecological\nniches, ecosystems, and the bios; as well as the 'houses' of inanimate\nphenomena: atmospheres, planets, the heliosphere, the galactic atmosphere,\nthe universe, factories, etc; Universe : Generalizing this terribly presumptuous concept might\nbe appropriate if there are other universes or quasi-external parts of\nour universe, Everett's Many-Worlds Cosmology is real, most of the mass\nof the universe is invisible and exotic stuff, there is an infinite microcosm,\nBohm's Implicate Order exists, etc; or to take account of Wheeler's Superspace,\nthe omniverse (all of spacetime), physicomental \"reality\", and the Ideocosm. Important genera of generalizable things, or of things whose treatment\nit will often be important to generalize, include : Effects; Causes;\nLaws; Analogies; Differences; Criteria; Definitions; Criticisms; Decisions;\nBeliefs; Answers; Questions; Assumptions; Acts; Abilities; Bads; Goods;\nAppearances; Concepts; Corollaries; States; Governments; Arguments; Discoveries;\nDoctrines; Domains; Errors; Events; Fields; Functions; Fundamentals; Generalizations\n(sic); Goals; Hierarchies; Dimensions and properties; Histories; Hypotheses;\nIgnorances; Illusions; Individuals; Instances; Instruments; Interactions;\nInterests; Inventions; Knowledge; Languages; Levels; Limitations; Mathematics;\nMechanisms; Metaphors; Methods; Models; Forms; Motions; Needs; Negations;\nNetworks; Niches; Nonexistences; Responsibilities; Opportunities; Order\ntypes; Origins; Paradoxes; Paths; Patterns; Plans; Possibilities; Predictions;\nPrinciples; Probabilities; Problems; Processes; Proofs; Purposes; Quantities;\nRelations; Representations; Resources; Roles; Rules; Scenarios; Senses;\nSeries; Shortcuts; Simplifications; Solutions; Spaces; Speculations; Stories;\nStrategies; Systems; Taxons; Theories; Things; Transcendences; Trees; Unifications;\nUncertainties; Uses; Values; Virtuals; Wants; Wisdoms; Behaviors; Combinations;\nCommonalities; Complexities; Conflicts; Cooperations; Correlations; Cybernetics;\nGeneses; Disjunctions; Alternatives; Circumstances; Perspectives; Analyses;\nClusters; Chains of consequences; Changes; Chances; Chaoses; Economics;\nElements; Equivalences; Essentials; Excuses; Experiments; Extensions; Futuribles;\n\"Groups\"; Equalities and inequalities; Equilibria; Manifolds; Connections;\nPractices; Norms; Statistics; Mappings; Centers; Tendencies, trends, and\ndirections; Standards; Cycles; Symmetries and asymmetries; Invariants and\nconservations; Convergences and divergences; Measures; Etc. Senses, methods, and types of generalization are : Things, concepts, methods, resources, etc that are ordinarily used in\nonly a limited way can be tentatively or permanently applied elsewhere ,\nto other things, domains, elements, tasks, subjects, etc, or universally; Words, concepts, things, loci, structures, operations, functions, etc\ncan be added to, combined with, included within , subsumed or treated\nunder, identified with, etc something : one or a set of : things,\nconcepts, words, functions, subjects, concerns, investigations, etc; Other forms of a thing, concept, or whatever can be created,\ndiscovered, postulated, treated, used, etc: one, many, or all; Something can be transformed into something else, of a similar\nor dissimilar nature, or something else can be derived from it; Finite boundaries of what a thing is, can be, applies to, etc\ncan be precisely discovered , investigated, described, referred to,\ndefined, assumed, or imposed - and arbitrary or false boundaries or limits\ncan be invalidated, removed, or transcended; Larger meanings or implications of a thing or concept can be\nadded, sought, hypothesized, found, researched, described, referred to,\nmade use of it, etc; Other examples or instances of a thing, concept, etc can be found,\ndescribed, validated, indicated, etc: one, many, or all; Something : supposedly or actually : particular , individual,\nconcrete, derivative, virtual, unique, anomalous, accidental, conditional,\ndependent, transitory, minor, indeterminate, meaningless, peripheral, etc\n: can be : transformed into , imagined as, or treated as : what is\ninstead instead : general , plural, abstract, nomothetic, primary,\nfundamental, real, variable, universal, normal, categoreal, necessary,\nabsolute, independent, enduring or eternal, major, determinate, meaningful,\nessential, central, cognitive or ideonomic, etc; Taxon or category : can be : given , treated as having,\nvirtually given, Tound to have, or postulated to have higher : taxological,\nexistential, or cognitive : status or nature e.g. a species may\nbe turned into a genus; Thing may be assigned to a higher taxon or category; More and more relationships of a : thing concept, etc : to more\nand more : things, concepts, parts of the world or reality, etc : may be\n: discovered, postulated, described, treated as existing, implied, sought,\ndifferentiated, created, etc; Analogs , equivalents, homologs, associates, etc : of a thing,\nconcept, or whatever can be : discovered, conceived of, postulated, surveyed,\ngrouped quantitatively and qualitatively relative to the 'thing', connected\nthereto, investigated, unified or synthesized with or treated as being\nidentical to the 'thing', treated conjointly with the 'thing', etc; In a larger and larger way just one or a few : dimensions , properties, aspects, elements, relationships, types,\nexamples, etc : of a thing, concept, or whatever may be : investigated,\ndiscovered, described, created, perfected, extended, postulated, or otherwise treated; Etc. Questions about generalization that ideonomy can help to ask and\nanswer include : What are the meta-structures of, connected with,\nand relevant to generalization overall or specific generalizations: e.g.\nhierarchies, networks, trees, series, vergences, rings, lattices, matrices,\ncircuitries, plexures, differential-topologic structures, fractals, chaos,\nPeano curves, tessellations or 'jigsaw puzzles', spheroids, convergences,\ndivergences, etc? And all canonical sub-types thereof? What are all : reciprocities, interrelationships, Interdependences,\nintertransformations, symmetries, asymmetries, co-probabilities, sets,\nequilibria, antisyzygies, redundancies and irredundancies, mereologies,\ncycles, interoperations, combinations and combinatorics, algebras, laws,\ninterrepresentations, morphisms, myrioramic. patterns, coevolutions, 'cellular-automaton\nlogics', logics, etc of all or particular sets of generalizations ? For all or particular : specific or generic : generalizations of\nall or particular : specific or generic : things, what are all generic\nand specific : Limits; Infinities; Goods and bads; Rules and errors;\nQuestions; Principles; Concepts; Mechanisms; Analogies and differences;\nPossibilities; Data; Tests, experiments, and proofs; Alternatives; Spectrums,\nranges, quantities, measures, and scalings; Mathematics; Probabilities;\nDimensions and properties; States, spaces, conditions, and environments;\nEvents, processes, procedures, methods, operations, and strategies; Contents;\nAssumptions; Gedankenexperiments; Decisions; Problems and solutions; Names,\ndefinitions, classifications, and descriptions; Neural correlates and bases;\nParadoxes; Emergents; Elements; Essentials; Evaluations; Extremes; Fields;\nPaths, courses, flows, motions, behaviors, changes, and transformations;\nFunctions, roles, purposes, uses, goals, and values; Corollaries, interests,\nand implications; Geneses; Games; Futuribles; \"Groups\"; Histories; Knowledges\nand ignorances; Illusions; Appearances; Complexities and simplicities;\nHarmonies and disharmonies; Languages; Negations; Opposites; Networks of\nconsequences; Levels and niveaus; Nonexistences; Order taxons; Origins;\nParadigms; Achievements and failures; Pathoses; Requirements; Possibilities;\nSub-types; Realms; Recursions; Chances; Representations and ideograms;\nResources (instruments and materials); Sets; Shortcuts; Stories; Surprises\nand discontinuities; Linearities and nonlinearities; Nonmonotonic manipulations;\nSystems; Theories; Transcendences; Wholes and gestalts; Wisdoms; Research\nprograms; Interdisciplinary relationships; Etc? What are all possible, all nonequivalent, all specialized, and all hierarchical\ngeneralizations of or regarding a single , random or particular, thing ? How can or should all things , or all sets of types of\nthings, be progressively generalized into, with respect\nto , or on the basis of, one another? What are all human motivations for generalizing and not generalizing\nany and all things in any and all ways in any and all circumstances; and\nwhat are all of the psychodynamics thereof? What are the total ideonomic\ninterests of these things? What are the current frontiers of generalization of things by\nmankind? Suggest Goals Many enterprises are launched, conducted, and even consummated with\nalmost no attention paid to their possible, actual, or appropriate goals. Yet this can cause many problems and have many costs, e.g. : Inefficiency;\nFailure to make adequate or correct provision or preparation; Inability\nto notice and rectify a faulty course; Taking of excessive or unnecessary\nrisks, perhaps unconsciously; Blindness to opportunities; Indecision and\ninaction in crises; Indirection and aimless wandering; Lack of plans and\npriorities; Inability to optimize the use--and mindless wastage--of finite\nresources; Anarchy; Distractibility; Inaction; Anomie and tedium; Lack\nof motivation; Inconsistencies, contradictions, and disharmonies; Impossibility\nof cooperative endeavor; Inability to structure existence; Fragility of\nan enterprise and a tendency for it to degenerate and fragment; Inability\nto discriminate good from bad--or to recognize what is best and worst,\nvital and unimportant, central and peripheral, significant and irrelevant,\netc; Anonymity to the world at large or external confusion and misreaction;\nEtc. Ideonomy can be used to suggest goals that are : new, alternative,\ncontrasting, successional or progressive, maximal or optimal, safe, certain,\ntranscendent or revolutionary, unconsidered or overlooked, realistic, easy,\nexpedient, productive, ultimate or supreme, simpler or more complex, indirect,\ncontingent, secondary or tertiary, suited to oneself, complementary to\nsituations or circumstances, compatible, synergistic, logical, less costly,\nmultidimensional or multipurpose, subtle, definable, proportionate to one's\nresources, unorthodox, contra-intuitive, irredundant, finite or infinite,\nequivalent or analogous, specific or general, universal, etc. Goals are often pursued that are the wrong ones, but they are not abandoned\nbecause they have never been made explicit. When some goal is made explicit\nit becomes possible to study its real meaning and importance and the relationships\nit has to other things that are being done or that might be done. The things\nthat are required for the goal to be achieved can be investigated, decided\nupon, and implemented. Ideonomy by its nature encourages the comparative study of every sort\nof goal in every sort of field, and profitable knowledge can be derived\nfrom this of the larger and more efficient ways and means of pursuing arbitrary\nor all goals. Mistakes that are apt to be made in selecting and achieving\ngoals can be identified, along with ways of avoiding those mistakes or\nof dealing with them when they occur. Other characteristic problems that are associated with the pursuit\nof goals include an overdramatization of the importance of a single\ngoal, token attention to the goal, a tendency for a goal to be misformulated\nor misinterpreted, failure to appreciate that a goal is apt to be more\nthan a simple name or definition and may embrace the simple insights that\nare apt to accrue in planning for and advancing toward the goal, the error\nof relying upon a single method or path for achieving the goal, etc. Illustrative examples of goals are : Putting the first men on\nthe Moon; Target in an enemy country of an intercontinental ballistic missile;\nDowning and eating of a gazelle as the goal of a lion that is stalking\nit; Student's goal of passing an exam; Finding a needle in a haystack;\nLanding someone as one's spouse; Solving some great unsolved problem in\nmathematics, as by finding a proof of Fermat's last theorem; Breaking an\nOlympic record in poll vaulting; 'Pineapple's goal' of reaching the standard\nsize specified by the genome of the pineapple plant; Zinc atoms' 'goal'\nto deposit themselves on the cathode in the electrolysis of zinc chloride\nsolution; Break-even point in research to achieve controlled thermonuclear\nfusion for industry; 'Goal' of a column of magma ascending through Earth's\ncrust to reach the atmosphere and erupt lava on the Earth's surface; Goal\nof a company to recover its investment in developing a new product; Puppy's\ngoal of reaching its mother's teat while fighting its littermates for the\nsame objective; Goal of a detective to discover the identity of a murderer;\n'Goal' of the disturbed surface of a pond to settle back into hydrostatic\n(gravitational) equilibrium; Etc. Although the concept of a goal in the realm of inanimate nature is momentarily\ndiscountenanced, several fundamental questions are in fact begged by this\nexclusion, and--certainly with revision--the concept may one day be be\nresurrected. At the very least it may be decided that the word should\nbe redefined so that it can function in this more embracive way, since\ndead matter can be observed to behave in ways that by analogy suggest\nthe pursuit and satisfaction of goals by organisms or minds. The 'goal'\nmay simply be the thermodynamic end-state of a physical process that is\nrelaxing toward equilibrium-regardless of whether that end-state is known,\nspecifiable, or even meaningful in advance, or of whether it is uniquely\nimplicit in some set of mathematical equations. It is also true that it\nis premature to absolutely exclude the possibility of teleological phenomena\nor of \"final causes\" from physical nature. Excluded possibilities in science\nhave a funny way of reentering the picture years later in radically different\ndress, although this is a lesson that scientists have been slow to learn. Show Paths To Goals It is possible to know, or even to prove, that a goal is attainable\nwhile at the same time remaining ignorant of how to actually achieve it.\nEven if all of the necessary resources and methods are at one's disposal,\na critical sequence of steps or concatenation of things may elude one.\nAn objective may hover an instant, layer, cell, operation, or decision\naway and yet be impossible to reach simply because the path to it is not\nknown, well-defined, or available. Ideonomy can teach general and specific ways to discover or create paths\nto specific and generic goals, and train the relevant skills. It can also suggest : Whether a desired or imagined path exists\nor not or would or would not be feasible; Costs and requirements of finding,\nconstructing, altering, or using paths; Things paths should avoid or their\ngeneral hazards; Different types of paths that are possible or appropriate;\nLikely and proper quantitative dimensions of paths; Consequences or side\neffects of using different paths; Etc. Clarify Good To clarify good it may be convenient, desirable, or necessary to first\nor eventually consult, define, investigate, portray, or even create bad.\nBads and goods are both primary concerns of ideonomy. Basic classes of goods are : Helps and assistance; 'Net goods';\nVirtues; Excellences; Benefits; Advantages; Ideals; Wishes and aims (desired\nthings and conditions); Needed and useful resources; Good luck; Pleasures\nand pleasurable things; and 'Non-bads' (absences of bad; everything that\nis not actually bad). The goods that interest ideonomy need not have anything to do with human\nbeings or human values. Inanimate phenomena and entities--and 'pure ideas',\nwhatever they are--have their own agathokakological orders. All goods of all things should be inquired into, systematized, and reduced\nto ever more universal laws. How can good be served, maximized, and evolved if we are ignorant of\nits kinds, possibilities, and laws? If we do not understand its complexities,\nproblems, contradictions, and illusions? If its elements, fundamentals,\nneeds, mechanisms, processes, and manifold relationships to the other things\nof the universe are unknown? One way to begin the scientific study of good would be to examine the\nnature, circumstances, and existence of a single-random or particular-thing\nin an effort to discover all goods of or connected with the thing, or every\nway and degree in which any or every thing is or is not 'good' for the\nthing or 'from the thing's perspective'. Were the thing to be given such comprehensive agathological scrutiny\nan ant, for example, one might ask and try to answer these questions: Is\nthe presence of a minimum amount of water in the soil important to the\nant's hive? Which traces of chemical elements are good for the ant's diet, even though they are not essential nutrients ? Are there diseases\nof other soil organisms that benefit the ant when they occur? What polymorphisms\nare good or best for the species of ant? What wind velocity at the mouth\nof an ant's nest is optimal for the colony, in good weather? Are there\ncertain early life experiences that are good for an ant to have, say because\nthey trigger the emergence of latent instincts, orient the ant for life\nto the peculiarities of its environment, or institute certain skills in\nthe then- plastic nervous system of the ant? Lessons here could be carried over experimentally to the possible goods\nfor other animal species. Discrepancies, adaptations, and supplementations\nnoted through such series, networks, and hierarchies of comparisons could\nlead to an even more powerful generalization of agathological knowledge,\nmethods, and skills, and eventually make possible the treatment of arbitrary\ngoods of arbitrary things. Another valuable ideonomic exercise would be to construct a diagram\nwith the names of a random set of related or maximally diverse things scattered\nabout but enclosed in ellipses. Arrows would be drawn between certain ellipses\nto indicate which things are or might be, in some sense or degree, good\nfor which other things. Arrows could be : one-way or two-way, simple\nor branched, connected only to ellipses or also referent to or from other\narrows ( à la vergences, networks, circuitries, hierarchies,\nor other meta- structures), weighted by being thickened, colored to signify\nsenses of good or goodness, etc. Complementary sets or suites of the diagram could be created to exhibit\nor investigate the difference that various arguments, circumstances,\nor perspectives make for the possible or actual relationships, incremental\nbut rational and natural changes in various directions (e.g. that of scaled\ntime or probability), how different people would render the same diagram,\netc. Such an agathological diagram - or agathogram - could be programmed\non a computer in a matric or dynamic form. Multivariate analysis, multidimensional\nscaling, cluster analysis, artificial intelligence techniques and programs,\netc could be used to discover and explore an agathological universe - or\nagathocosm - of : meaningful, contrasting, interdependent, orthogonal,\nnonexistent, evolutionary, anamorphic, circular, cyclic, autopoietic, mathematically\ndiverse, arborescent, stochastic, chaotic, aesthetically appealing, \"implicate\"\n(in David Bohm's sense), etc : idea spaces, permutations, combinations,\nclusters, chains, series, \"rotations\", inversions, representations, games,\nsystems of motions and transformations, morphogeneses, other types of ideograms,\netc. All of the : senses, categories, types, subtypes, taxons, and\nnatural taxological systems : of special or universal goods need to\nbe identified, described, named, evaluated, reduced to operations and\nlogic and transformations, etc. They should be used to : discover,\nimagine, investigate, characterize, compare, interrelate, synthesize, criticize,\nperfect, exploit, transcend, teach, etc all goods of all things. What are all known or possible dimensions for scaling goods or\nthe goodness of things, and all actual scalings and co-scalings of all\nabstract and concrete goods, e.g. per : closeness, redundancy, co-representability\nor comparability, orthogonality, oppositeness, cost, frequency of exemplification,\ntypological diversity, confinement to man (anthropomorphism) or contrary\nexemplification throughout nature, human importance, human agreement about,\ndegree of clustering, logical containment or hierarchy, universal symmetry,\nconceptual simplicity, etc? How does the same type of good vary when it is exemplified in different\nphenomena or sciences? What are all of the goods and bads that converge in and/or diverge from\nsingle events? What transvaluations of goods, or of the goodness of things, are possible,\ndesirable, or inevitable? Some illustrative genera of good are : order, harmony, efficiency,\nsimplicity, reliability, strength, success, improvement, wealth, balance\nor proportion, security, freedom, opportunity, utility, diversity, transcendence,\nwisdom, power, control, productivity, flourishing, peace, 'health', problemlessness,\nsalubrity, wholeness, meaning, challenge, consummation, certainty, purpose,\ndirection, preservation, beauty, challenge, responsibility, 'fairness',\ngood fortune, cleanliness, clarity, sophistication, assistance, synergism,\ntruth, self-mastery, etc. All causes of good need to be discovered, defined, distinguished, quantified,\nexplained, synthesized, systematized, mastered (technologically and methodologically),\netc. Yet the causes of both specific and generic goods are often esoteric. Some possible or known causes of good are : one or more other\ngoods; universal laws and relationships; nature's pervasive or absolute\nself- similarity; the subjectivity of 'goods' and the spatiotemporal invariances\nof human minds; striving for good; plans; methods; cooperative and coevolutionary\ntendencies of natural phenomena; evolution--incl. self- evolution and cosmic\nevolution-of things and goods; the pervasive tendency of the universe to\norder and organize itself; moral and legal laws; the sense of beauty; fractal,\nharmonic, hierarchic, vergent, cyclic, and other meta- patterns and meta-structures;\nman's habits of collecting, preserving, nursing, and combining goods or\ngood things; early agathology; etc. Some illustrative species or narrow examples of good are : humility,\nhonesty, sanity, kindness, reverence, trust, stability, civilization, good\nhabits, tolerance, gentleness, magnanimity, eloquence or mastery of language,\nlongevity, altruism, grace, happiness., comfort, leisure, community, scientific\nand technological progress, economic growth, wit, family strength, quiet,\nnonpollution of the environment, learning, teaching, husbandry of human\nresources, thrift, military peace, good government, manners, integrity,\nrefinement of taste, and the doing of good. Ideonomy might be used to investigate what is good for, in, about,\nor otherwise in connection with such diverse particular things as :\nsoil, the family, enzymes, the human voice, an enemy, a friend, spiders,\na spider's web, grape flavor, starlight, yard sales, religion, atheism,\nthe Golgi apparatus (dictyosomes), war (sic), bads (sic), virtue, the crossword\npuzzle, seed dispersal, the honeybee waggle dance, filter feeding, Earth's\nwinds, cosmic gravity waves, binary star systems, beaches, time, Reynold's\nnumber (Re = rn L/ h ),\nthe alga, earth tides, psychoanalytic transference, intelligence tests,\noneself, the unconscious mind, heat diffusion, proton precession, striations\nin electrical discharge, radioactivity, adjoint groups, paracompact space,\nexterior algebras of linear spaces, Fourier transforms, saddle points,\noverteaching, ring whizzers and other fluxional molecules, monomolecular\nfilms, certain choices of starting materials in chemistry, marine upwelling,\nthe sea's internal waves, ocean spray, a falling birth rate, acculturation\n(intercultural borrowing), twinned crystals, the semicolon, taxation, the\nSwiss system of government, German character, boldness in war, military\nnight operations, astronomy, historiographic periodization, goodwill in\ncommerce, expressionist painting, the design of a safety pin, one person's\nhandwriting, leveraged buyouts, corporate disclosure, FM (frequency modulation)\nradio transmission, the gear, formal education, the metaphor, crying, touristry\nto the Third World, divinities, the universe, the mathematical point, play,\nbirds' nests, the chair, the theater, the Dirac quantum mechanical vacuum,\ncompetition, philosophy, the pinna, examples, music, continental drift,\nultramicrophysical strings, etc. The ideonomic treatment of good and bad can be pandisciplinary in two senses: not only can ideonomy help to treat the content or phenomena of\nall subjects, but it can at the same time be used to evaluate, criticize,\nand improve the work, organization, and structure of entire disciplines. Thus it could be used to answer the question : what in the methods,\nresearch programs, tools, goals, foundations, concepts and theories, language,\nresearch foci, institutions, pedagogy, publications, etc of present- day biology is good and bad? Help Treat the Hardest Things At any moment in a given field certain problems, tasks, questions, methods,\nphenomena, domains, unmet needs, goals, concepts, subfields, etc explicitly\nor implicitly exist that are the most difficult ones of all in that field;\nand a subset of these things will be the hardest things in human knowledge\nand endeavor as a whole. Breakthroughs in these cases are apt to cause the greatest excitement,\nhave the largest consequences for those fields or for civilization, shift\nparadigms or upend cherished beliefs, reorient or revolutionize theoretical\nor experimental inquiry, initiate new fields of investigation, conclude\nor commence the longest-lived and most emotional squabbles, etc. In an abstract and generic sense the hardest things are apt to be or\nrelate to: Demonstrations that a postulated or implied entity or relationship\nexists or does not exist, or is possible or impossible; Firm proofs or\ndisproofs of a proposition or hypothesis; Unifications of an entire field\nor theory; Proofs of the equivalence or nonequivalence of two fundamental\nthings; Universality of some concept, law, relation, or phenomenon; Demonstration\nthat a certain thing is truly fundamental or more fundamental than anything\nelse known or possible; Falsification or modification of what are assumed\nto be universal or absolute laws, constants, theories, etc; Gaining of\nabsolute or overriding control over some system, process, or phenomenon;\nObtaining complete knowledge or understanding of a thing; Advances\ninvolving extremely complex or chaotic phenomena; Matters that require\nbreakthroughs in pure or applied logic; Etc. For a variety of reasons ideonomy may in the future play an important\nrole in the treatment of the hardest things : It may be a fallacy that\nthe hardness of solving certain classes of problems is fundamental, intrinsic,\nand irreducible--and ideonomy may help challenge this highly influential\nfallacy; it may be a fallacy that there is only one way to solve certain\nproblems or answer certain questions--and ideonomy may have a peculiar\npower to bring to light the actual richness of possibilities; One of the\nspurs for the creation of ideonomy in the first place was the attempt to\nfurnish the human mind with some universally more powerful instrument in\nthe treatment of extreme difficulty and complexity, and in the handling\nof the special problems being created by the explosive growth of human\nknowledge, technology, and endeavor; Unexpected analogies may exist between\nthe hardest things in different sciences, the concepts and methods pertinent\nthereto, the importances thereof, and even the basic solutions to the problems\nrepresented by such things--analogies that ideonomy can help to reveal\nand treat; Ideonomy can be used to ascertain and dramatize the absolute\nand relative need, importance, and consequences of achieving the hardest\nthings; Ideonomy can systematize, coordinate, accelerate, and maximize\nthe imagination and discovery of the totality of hardest things; Usually\nfew people know of the existence, nature, and implications of the hardest\nthings, and ideonomy can make such knowledge more broadly available, both\nwithin the relevant field and outside it; Etc. Some illustrative examples of the hardest things are : Whether,\nin mathematics, there are fractional alefs, or whether alef one is or is\nnot equivalent to the power of the continuum; Nature of measurement in\nquantum theory; Fundamental relationship between quantum and relativity\nphysics; How our brain thinks or computers can be made to think as well\nor better; Fundamental relationship between the physical and mental aspects\nof nature; Basic nature of mathematical truth; Question as to the ultimate\nsafety of scientific and technological progress, or of how to insure its\nsafety; Many- body problems in mathematical physics; What the essential\nnature of life is; Whether actual infinities exist in nature or nature\nis wholly finite and discrete; Why nature itself exists in the first place;\nExtent to which our picture of nature is reducible to one or a few things\n(e.g. laws, forces, entities, sciences, theories, representations, phenomena,\nrelationships, processes, principles, substances, problems, concepts, etc);\nUnification of gravitation with the other known fundamental physical forces;\nIsolation of the fundamental, quantitative, and predictive laws of society\nor of social behavior and development; Automation of artistic creation;\nCreation of a fully consistent, or comprehensive, theory of probability;\nLogical foundations of physics; Nature of randomness or its contribution\nto the physical world; Scientific basis of ethics; Why physical space is--or\nseems--tridimensional; Structure and dynamics of Dirac's quantum-mechanical\nvacuum; Ergodic theory; Information theory; Prediction of patterns given\ncellular automata will produce, or of the cellular automata that can generate\ndesired or noted patterns; Initial conditions of 'the universe'; Long-term\nfuture of civilization; Measurement of gravitation's fundamental velocity\nor coupling constant to other basic forces, or detection of gravity waves\nor gravitons; Basic nature of time, or whether reversible travel backwards\nand forwards in time is feasible; How life began, and a priori probability\nof its origin or repeated origin (around the universe ); Basic structure\nof the universe; How to civilize human nature or the earth--or extinguish\nwar and crime; How much of the human mind is inherited from the human genome;\nWhat the quantity of nonsense in the world is; Etc. What are all of the hardest problems and possibilities that are connected\nwith a single, random or particular, thing? Where would all of the examples of hardest things that were mentioned\nabove fall on a universal scale of degrees of hardness? Which of the things\nwould be most ambiguous or hard to place on such a scale? What hierarchies of hardest things are there? Also what series, networks,\ntrees, rings (sic), clusters, etc? Which of the things listed above should be tackled first and last --and\nwhy? Are there things that are by definition, or that can be proven in advance\nto be, infinitely hard to accomplish or know? Where would the examples of hardest things above all fall on a scale\ngiving the imagined quantity of future time that will or must elapse before\nthat which they speak of becomes known or is achieved? What are the basic reasons for the hardness of each of those things? Which of those apparent or supposed hardnesses may in fact be illusory? On the other hand, which of all those things that would seem to us easy\nto accomplish or know in the future, may actually turn out to be hard or\namong the hardest of possibilities? What were the hardest problems historically and how were they solved?\nMoreover, what resulted from their solution or explanation-and what lessons\nmay there be for us now as we confront those things that for ourselves\nare the hardest to come to terms with? Describe Hierarchies From the point of view of ideonomy, an infinite number and variety of\nhierarchies may well exist in and as nature, and all things, in some sense,\nmay be hierarchical or possess hierarchical aspects, elements, and relationships. The foreseen task is to find and define the totality of such hierarchies\nand hierarchical relationships, to identify the laws thereof, and to progressively\nexploit the opportunities implicit in such things. Of course hierarchy represents just one of the basic genera of\nso-called meta-structures that presumably pervade the universe or 'reality',\nbut the exemplifications, meanings, and possibilities of each such genus\nmust be thoroughly investigated and elaborated. The case of hierarchy can\nserve as a general example of what must be done and of what is apt to follow\nupon the doing of it. What is meant by the word or concept of hierarchy? One way to answer\nthis question is by seeing what hierarchy could mean--or what hierarchies\nmay in fact, or could in theory, exist--in connection with a variety of\nthings. For example: Could there be a hierarchy of snowflakes ? Actually there could\nbe many such hierarchies: Presumably there is a probability spectrum for\ndifferent flake shapes; Formative mechanisms may be plural or subject to\ncomplication or external influences, in which case either the causes or\ntheir effects may canonically progress in chains and branch in--chronological\nor nomological-- trees; Probability or existence of certain flake forms\nmay be a function of the set-theoretic statistics or combinatorial clustering\nof other flake forms; Etc. Ahierarchy of winters ? Perhaps winters can be multidimensionally\ndescribed and there are certain types of winters that are only likely to\nto occur after, or somewhere in the middle of, certain sequences of other\ntypes of winters; Perhaps there is a hierarchy of descriptions or of descriptive\nelements, such that certain descriptions or elements are more fundamental\nor at least simpler than others, and it is appropriate or necessary to\n'move along' the hierarchy in attempting to characterize winters; Etc. Ahierarchy of stars ? Certain stars generate chemical elements\nand isotopes that are then recycled in other stars and without which those\nother types and generations of stars are impossible; Similar stellar hierarchy\nmay exist thanks to the production, recycling, multistage transformation,\nor control of different molecular species by generations--or perhaps by\nsynchronic hierarchies--of stars; Hierarchical sets of stars may create\ndifferent physical conditions at a variety of levels (e.g. of stellar density)\nthat induce special types of stars, or of stellar behavior, at those levels;\nEtc. Possible or actual properties, dimensions, or features of hierarchies\nor of their contents include : Elements; Sets, subsets, and supersets;\nLevels; Degrees; Layers; Ranges; Intervals; Gaps; Folia; Partitions; Stages;\nChains or sequences; Series; Harmonics or powers; Units and multiples;\nDomination and subordination; Supreme commander; Tops, apexes, vertexes,\netc; Bottoms, bases, roots, foundations, etc; Starts, origins, first things,\na single beginner, etc; Stops, finishes, last things, etc; Greatest or\nmaximal thing; Least or minimal things or thing; Thresholds; Transformations;\nRhythms, cycles, iterations, reappearances, etc; Poles, orientations, etc;\nInversions; Transitivity; Asymmetry; Antisymmetry; Control, government,\nor regulation; Ranks; Superiority; One-many relationships; Trees or arborescence;\nDirection; Unidirectional action; Dependences, independences, and interdependences;\nMonotonic progression; Emergence; Equivalent and nonequivalent elements;\nSimplicity; Internal structure and external form; Completeness and all-\ninclusiveness; Horizontal and vertical relationships; Rules; Defined or\nexact relationships; Continuity; Universality; Pyramidality; Discrete and\ncontinuous aspects; Opposites, antipolarity, and antisyzygies; Uniqueness\nor singularity; Unity-in-diversity; Spectrums; Convergence, divergence,\nand vergence; Orthogonality; Etc. Possible effects, values, or uses of hierarchies include: Arbitrarily\nlarge sets of things or elements can be connected, reduced, related, or\ntraced back to, or derived from, just a single thing, element:, point,\nevent, law, etc.--via a path that is at once maximally short, powerful,\ncomprehensive, logical, necessary, central, self-similar, ubiquitous, etc;\nCausation, perturbation, government, etc can be shown to be, or treated\nas being, completely unidirectional and an incremental and comprehensive\nflow over an arbitrarily large set of identical or diverse things, processes,\nphenomena, domains, effects, changes, events, etc; Time-asymmetric evolution\nof an entire system or universe; Flows in two opposite and paired directions\ncan be enabled or defined--flows of an opposite, complementary, reciprocal,\nor independent nature or content; Things or processes of every possible\nsize, number, or complexity can all be 'reduced' to the dimidiations, doublings,\nbifurcations, partitionings, iterations, recursions, fractal structure,\nor the like of a single thing, process, pattern, or the like--so that the\nsmallest and largest scales or sets, first and last things, whole and parts,\ne/vc of the hierarchy are mutually derived, antisyzygially, in an exact\nor approximate way; Generalization, specialization, and their interdetermination;\nAlternative descriptions, classifications, or treatments of things can\nbe rigorously excluded; Possibilities can be constrained; Different and\ndisjunct trees of possibilities can be differentiated and selected; Things\ncan be described or controlled via the simplest language, code, logic,\nor information-theoretic structure; Operations or actions can be reduced\nto uniquely consecutive and finite decisions; Variables can be treated\nas constants, and constants as variables, at successive 'levels'; Those\ndegrees of freedom that enable the self- organization of a phenomenon or\nrealm can be increased or maximized; Potential or actual self-interaction,\nself-government, self-connection, autocorrelation, self-description, complexity,\nheterogeneity, proteanness, e/vc of a thing or phenomenon can be maximized;\nUse of resources can be optimized, or need for resources minimized; Redundancy\ncan be minimized, irredundancy maximized (and vice versa, paradoxically);\nEtc. In a simpler way, hierarchies or hierarchization can serve, i. a.: classification, description, definition, development, morphogenesis, evolution,\ntransformation, revolution, generalization, specialization, integration,\nisolation, amplification, analogization, distinguishing, specification,\nindividuation, universalization, organization, self- organization, control,\ngovernment, meetings of opposites, simplification, complexification, randomization,\nlocalization, innovation, distribution, centralization, decentralization,\nself-reference, operationalization or processualization, conservation,\nconceptualization, mechanization, simulation or modeling, proceduralization,\nstratification, cooperation, diversification, nomogenesis ( sensu either the discovery of laws, or their emergence and evolution), systemization,\ncorrection or adjustment, adaptation, stabilization, selection, search,\nchecking, supervision, coordination, communication, compilation, colligation,\nassimilation, convergence, divergence, 'parsing', counting, etc. More specifically, hierarchy or hierarchization serve or are exemplified\nin or by: e.g. memory (or memorization and recall), recognition, thought,\nbodily action, feeling, psychogenesis, social evolution, biosynthesis,\nthe evolution of life, cosmogony, parallel computation, industrialization,\nhuman government, military organization and strategy, nervous systems and\nartificial neural nets, computer hardware and software, evolution and classification\nof mathematical ideas, the process or result of painting, accounting, language\ntranslation, literary analysis (as of a novel), family relationships, the\nimmunal system or immunogenesis, ecological structure and processes, genomic\nstructure and function, ontogenesis, social stratification, structure and\ntraffic dynamics of a nation's road system, etc. Universal genera of hierarchies include hierarchies of : abilities,\nacts, alternatives, AMBIGUITIES, analogies, ANSWERS, ANTISYZYGIES, appearances,\nassumptions, bads, beauties, behaviors, beliefs, causes, CHAINS, CHANCES,\nCHANGES, CHAOSES, circumstances, clusters, coevolutions, COMBINATIONS,\nCOMPLEXITIES, CONCEPTS, conflicts, connections, CONSERVATIONS, contents,\ncontrols, CONVERGENCES, cooperations, COPROBABILITIES, corollaries, COURSES,\ncriterions, CRITICISMS, CYCLES, decisions, defects, definitions, descriptions,\ndifferences, discoveries, disequilibriums, disjunctions, DISTRIBUTIONS,\nDIVERGENCES, doctrines, domains, ecological things, ECONOMIC THINGS, EFFECTS,\nelements, emergents, ENVIRONMENTS, EQUALITIES, equilibriums, EQUIVALENCES,\nerrors, essentials, EVALUATIONS, events, examples, EXCELLENCES, excuses,\nexpectations, EXPERIENCES, EXPERIMENTS, EXTREMES, fields, FIRST PRINCIPLES,\nFLOWS, forms, functions, FUNDAMENTALS, FUTURES, FUTURIBLES, games, GENERALIZATIONS,\ngeneses, goals, goods, \"GROUPS\", hardest things, heuristics, HIGHER REALITIES,\nhistories, HYPOTHESES, IDENTITIES, IGNORANCES, ILLUSIONS, IMAGES, implications,\nIMPOSSIBILITIES, INDIVIDUALS (sic), INEQUALITIES, INFINITIES (and INFINITESIMALS),\nINFORMATION- THEORETIC THINGS AND ENTROPIES, instances, INSTRUMENTS, interdependences\nand reciprocities, interests, inventions, INVERSIONS, KNOWLEDGES, languages\nand linguistic things, LAWS, limitations, LOGICAL THINGS, MANIFOLDS, mathematical\nthings, MATRICES, MEASUREMENTS, MEASURES AND DIMENSIONS, mechanisms, METAPHORS,\nmethods, MINDS AND INTELLIGENCE, MODELS, MOTIONS, needs, NEGATIONS, NETWORKS\nNETWORKS OF CONSEQUENCES, NICHES, NONEXISTENCES, operations, OPPORTUNITIES,\nORDER TAXONS, ORIGINS, PARADIGMS, paradoxes, pathoses, PATHS, patterns,\nPERSPECTIVES, phenomenons, plans, possibilities, practices, PREDICTIONS,\npreparations, THE PRESENT, principles, PROBABILITIES, PROBLEMS, PROCESSES,\nproofs, PROPERTIES, psychological things, PURPOSES, quantities, QUESTIONS,\nREACTIONS, realms, RECURSIONS, relations, RELAXATIONS, representations,\nresources, responsibilities, RINGS, roles, rules, SELF- EFFECTS, SERIES,\nsets, SHORTCUTS, SIMPLICITIES AND SIMPLIFICATIONS, SIMULATIONS, SOLUTIONS,\nSPACES, speculations, STATES AND CONDITIONS, STORIES, strategies, SURPRISES,\nsystems, tactics, taxons, TECHNOLOGICAL THINGS, THALWEGS, THEORIES, things,\nTHOUGHTS, TOPOLOGICAL THINGS, transcendences, TRANSFORMATIONS, TREES, types,\nULTIMATES AND ENDS, ULTRAFUNDAMENTALS, uncertainties and doubts, unifications,\nthe 'universe', uses, VALUES, VERGENCES, virtuals, wants, wholes and GESTALTS,\nwisdoms, and WORK. Particularly or peculiarly interesting genera of hierarchies in this\nlist are in upper case. Many suggest fascinating problems, questions, and\npossibilities--which ideonomy will eventually address. Actually many things need to be learned about all of those genera. Thus\nwhat are all of their : exemplifications, specializations, causes, effects,\nroles, interrelations and interactions, laws, activities, structures, transformations,\nhistories, futures, evolutions and retrogressions, fine structure, etc? Hierarchy can be defined in many different ways. The dictionary distinguishes :\n(1) The arrangement of objects, elements, or values in a graduated series;\n(2) Aseries of objects, elements, or values so arranged; (3) In logic, a series the members of which are grouped in accordance with a principle\n(as of importance, perfection, or priority); (4) The stratification so\nachieved; specifically , a table of statistical correlations having\na constant proportional relationship and graded from high to low; (5) Abody of persons or things ranked in grades, orders, or classes, one above\nanother; a system or series of terms of successive rank, used in classification\n(as in biology). Additionally, of the adjective \"hierarchical\" it says: (6) Having the\npower to control; influential. Amore ideonomic characterization of hierarchy: (7) At the top or upward\nis the thing or set of things that controls, dominates, influences, limits,\nexpresses, indicates, facilitates, e/vc the meaning, importance, behavior,\ndegrees of freedom, changes, possibilities, relationships, aspects, costs,\nneeds, outputs, e/vc of that below or dot-inward."}]}

(Plymouth, MI), Fraunhofer USA Center for Laser Technology (Plymouth, MI), and Bender Shipbuilding & Repair Co. (Mobile, AL) teamed up to develop the first autogenous laser welding application in a U.S. shipyard in a program sponsored by the Office of Naval Research through its Small Business Innovation Research program. The goal was to develop and qualify laser welding as a cost-effective method for producing tab-and-slot sandwich panels. It was also required to use Bender’s existing large laser cutting gantry, and the time for converting from cutting to welding should be less than 30 minutes. Tab-and-slot sandwich panels use the laser to cut the stiffeners with twist tabs and to cut the mating slots in the face sheets. In a second operation the stiffeners are assembled with the faceplates and the twist tabs are turned to hold the assembly together. In another operation laser welding is performed through the faceplates into the stiffener. This concept allows fixtureless manufacturing of large sandwich panels, representing dramatic cost savings. It also enables sandwich panels where the thickness and location of the stiffener can be designed for optimum load bearing and load distribution. Awell-known analogy in automotive industry is (non-linear) tailored blanks. Three-dimensional tailored blanks are also possible through cutting curved stiffeners and rolling the faceplate to the form of the stiffeners. The process, weld cross section, and product are shown in Figure 1."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Click here to enlarge image FIGURE 1. Laser welding (upper left), a typical cross section (upper right), and the final sandwich panel (bottom)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The laser beam is scanned across the thickness of the stiffener to achieve full fusion at the interface between the stiffener and the faceplate. The resulting weld nugget shows no porosity and a convex shape in the edges, which indicates high strength and high fatigue life. Single path laser welding was also investigated, but much higher porosity and incomplete fusion at the interface were found. To achieve full fusion the individual single path weld lines had to overlap significantly resulting in increased weld time compared to the weave weld. In the spring of this year, a Flexible Laser Optic (FLO) was installed on Bender’s Tanaka 6kW CO 2 laser cutter. Cutting accuracies of 0.001 in. are achieved over the entire 20-ft. width and 160-ft. length. Changing to this optic allowed Bender to become the first shipyard in the United States to successfully laser weld a structural steel sandwich panel on the shipyard’s production equipment. Sandwich panels were welded, using 6 kW of power, with a speed of 30 ipm for 1/8 in. and 15 ipm for 3/8 in. thickness (see Figure 2)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Through further development and higher laser power, the FLO system will be used for welding up to ½-in. thick sandwich panels. Future work includes additional process development for materials such as aluminum and high strength and stainless steel to enable the fabrication of panels for lightweight ship construction. Integration of seam tracking and weld monitoring will also be pursued to meet the 100 percent weld inspection that is now required for all new naval construction. The technology has opened the door for cost effectively manufacturing a wide variety of sandwich panels with complex geometries using the tab-and-slot design together with laser welding of the stiffeners through the face sheets. Remote welding In parallel, Visotek and Fraunhofer have been pursuing robotic remote welding with the FLO system. The first remote welding systems used fast scanning mirrors instead of gantries or robots to move the laser beam quickly from one weld line to the next, a benefit, if multiple short welds have to be performed on different locations of the work piece, such as welding reinforcements in place. The scanning mirrors can move the laser beam quickly, in a matter of tens of milliseconds, across the working envelope, while conventional motion systems require seconds for repositioning. Dramatic increases in productivity, up to ten times higher, and a laser on-time of more than 95 percent result. State-of-the-art systems use a high beam quality CO 2 laser with up to 6kW output power and a stationary scanning system, limiting the part geometry to two dimensions in one plane. The working envelope of a single scanner system with fixed optic is mainly determined by the beam quality of the laser, limiting the maximum laser power to currently 6 kW and thus the maximum welding speed and material thickness. Three-dimensional remote welding was recently introduced by putting the scanner on the arm of a robot. This combines the capabilities and cost effectiveness of robotics with the fast beam steering capabilities of the scanner. The robotic path can be planned with minimum accelerations and large radii, while the scanner compensates for kinked or sharply curved weld lines. Multiple weld patterns are possible, such as a spot with about 10 mm diameter in analogy to the size of a resistance spot weld, staples, or straight stitches. The actual weld pattern is tailored to the strength and fatigue requirements of the part. Nd:YAG or fiber lasers with up to 4 kW power and good beam quality, typically delivered through a 0.2mm optical cable, are used in combination with special high-power scanning systems. About 50 robotic remote welding systems are now used in production at various automotive plants and their suppliers. CO 2 lasers represent a much more cost effective laser system than Nd:YAG or fiber lasers, however, their long wavelength does not allow the use of dielectric, lightweight mirrors as they are deployed in conventional high-speed scanners. The FLO optic with water-cooled mirrors and proprietary drives is mounted at the end of a robot. The beam from a 6kW PRC laser is delivered through an articulated arm. The motion of the scanner is synchronized with the motion of the robot to produce a circular weld line with 8mm diameter. Test coupons with 1mm thickness of the upper sheet and 2mm thickness of the lower sheet were used for the initial welding trials. At a robot speed of about 6 m/min, 240 spots per minute could be welded (see Figure 3)."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Click here to enlarge image FIGURE 3. Experimental set-up for robotic remote welding with FLO optic. 240 spots per minute were welded in a 1mm/2mm set-up using 6 kW of power from a standard CO 2 laser (PRC). The spots have a diameter of 8 mm."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Clear heat marks were visible at the bottom side of the coupons, indicating the potential for even higher welding speeds. The coupons were arranged in a different level (see Figure 3) to prove the functionality and response time of the integrated autofocus. No difference in weld quality and penetration depth could be detected in the two spots next to the step. The system is currently benchmarked against a conventional remote welding system, an automotive application, welding reinforcements to a fender. The use of cost-effective CO 2 lasers and the high power handling capabilities of FLO optics can increase productivity through higher welding speeds or welding of thicker materials. Because it can be easily retrofit to conventional laser systems and robots found in many manufacturing facilities, the system offers a viable alternative to resistance spot welding at minimum capital equipment costs.

Jenkins (1997) reports Cameron, a researcher in organizational behaviour, as saying that, \"downsizing [is] the most pervasive yet unsuccessful change effort in the business world\". Some techniques fail, or at least are dropped from the repertoire, because they are Utopian in character: organizations are told that the technique must be applied throughout the organization for the full benefits to be achieved. This was the case with business process re-engineering, but businesses quickly realised that the costs of carrying out BPR throughout the organization would be crippling and, because they attempted to apply the technique to only part of the company, the results were less than satisfactory - in fact, two thirds of BPR efforts are said to have failed ( Hall, et al. , 1994 ).

Failure to do so results in one or other of these terms standing as a synonym for the other, thereby confusing anyone who wishes to understand what each term signifies. Happily, it is quite easy to distinguish between 'knowledge' and 'information' in such a way as to remove ambiguity and, at the same time, demonstrate the fundamental nonsense of 'knowledge management'. 'Knowledge' is defined as what we know: knowledge involves the mental processes of comprehension, understanding and learning that go on in the mind and only in the mind, however much they involve interaction with the world outside the mind, and interaction with others. Whenever we wish to express what we know, we can only do so by uttering messages of one kind or another - oral, written, graphic, gestural or even through 'body language'. Such messages do not carry 'knowledge', they constitute 'information', which a knowing mind may assimilate, understand, comprehend and incorporate into its own knowledge structures. These structures are not identical for the person uttering the message and the receiver, because each person's knowledge structures are, as Schutz (1967) puts it, 'biographically determined'. Therefore, the knowledge built from the messages can never be exactly the same as the knowledge base from which the messages were uttered. In common usage, these two terms are frequently used as synonyms, but the task of the academic researcher is to clarify the use of terms so that the field of investigation has a clearly defined vocabulary.  The present confusion over 'knowledge management' illustrates this need perfectly. The consequence of this analysis is that everything outside the mind that can be manipulated in any way, can be defined as 'data', if it consists of simple facts, or as 'information', if the data are embedded in a context of relevance to the recipient.  Collections of messages, composed in various ways, may be considered as 'information resources' of various kinds - collections of papers in a journal, e-mail messages in an   electronic 'folder', manuscript letters in an archive, or whatever. Generally, these are regarded as 'information resources'. Thus, data and information may be managed, and information resources may be managed, but knowledge (i.e., what we know) can never be managed, except by the individual knower and, even then, only imperfectly. The fact is that we often do not know what we know: that we know something may only emerge when we need to employ the knowledge to accomplish something. Much of what we have learnt is apparently forgotten, but can emerge unexpectedly when needed, or even when not needed. In other words we seem to have very little control over 'what we know'."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "What is 'knowledge management'?"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "If the definitions above are adequate to distinguish between 'knowledge' and 'information' (and genuine debate on this would be useful), the question of what 'knowledge management' might be becomes interesting.

The search was restricted to the title mainly to produce a manageable data file, but also on the proposition that if the term appeared in the title, the papers were likely to focus clearly on the topic.  The result is shown in Figure 1: It can be seen that the term did not occur until 1986 and from 1986 to 1996, there were only a few occurrences in each year. From 1997 to date, however, the growth has been exponential, but the data for 2002 suggest that the rate of growth has slowed considerably.

Two items were simply editorials in journals - when these are removed we are left with thirty-three papers, the largest single category of which deal with artificial intelligence and expert systems (seven papers), followed by general aspects of computing (four papers), decision support systems (three papers) information technology in general (two papers) and miscellaneous subjects (i.e., databases, digitisation, geographical information systems, and human-computer interaction - four papers) Taking these together as dealing with computing and its applications, we have 61% of the papers. Apart from these computing topics we have education, the human genome project, information policy, information management, organizational structure, product development, terminology, and a variety of other subjects. Clearly, however, before the surge in publication in 1997, 'knowledge management' meant some application or other of computers, with the influence stemming from the notion of 'knowledge bases' in the expert systems field. The analysis also suggests that, from the beginning, there has been confusion over what the term meant, since few of these papers bother to define the term. This focus on technology appears to persist: Idownloaded 158 references from the Web of Science for 1999 to 2001 into EndNote and then searched the abstracts for specific terms: without taking account of double counting, 'information technology', 'technology' and 'software' occurred a total of 66 times, while 'information sharing', 'communities of practice' and 'knowledge sharing' occurred a total of only 10 times. To determine the current nature of 'knowledge management' in more detail, Isearched the Web of Science again (all three citation indexes) for papers published in 2001 with the phrase 'knowledge management' in the record. Excluding abstracts of papers, this produced 242 items, distributed over 106 journals.  On a relatively crude classification, the 106 journals were distributed across 26 subject fields, with six fields having more than three journal titles. This suggests that the concept (although interpreted in different ways in different fields) is widely distributed across fields of practice."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Subject area No. of titles"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Computing & Information systems 26 Information Science, Information Management & Librarianship 18 Management 13 Artificial Intelligence 10 Engineering 8 Medicine 4"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Only 41 journals carried more than one paper with the relevant phrase in the title in the year, and only 10 journals carried more than four.

Further examination of the journals revealed that eight of the papers retrieved were simply Editorials to thematic issues and that the IBM Systems Journal special issue had twelve papers rather than the seven revealed by the search.

It is possible to transfer data about what we know into a database, but it is never possible to transfer the knowledge. Only one paper ( Sutton, 2001 ) asks what knowledge is and whether it can be managed, but then confuses things by referring to information as 'codified knowledge'.

The papers are rather more diverse that those in the journals examined previously and, overall, are less oriented towards information systems. Nevertheless, five papers have a technology orientation. The first of these, by Marwick (2001) is flawed simply because it accepts, uncritically, Nonaka's mistaken understanding of Polanyi's concept of tacit and explicit knowledge. However, this analysis is soon abandoned because Marwick comes to the unsurprising conclusion that, 'there are still significant shortfalls in the ability of technology to support the use of tacit knowledge - for which face-to-face meetings are still the touchstone of effectiveness.' and 'the strongest contribution to current solutions is made by technologies that deal largely with explicit knowledge, such as search and classification.' ['Explicit knowledge', of course, is simply a synonym for 'information'.]\r\n\r\nThe first of the remaining 'technology' papers deals with 'knowledge portals', which turn out to be, 'single-point-access software systems intended to provide easy and timely access to information and to support communities of knowledge workers who share common goals.' In other words, a Web-based information system. The rationale for adopting the term 'knowledge portal' becomes very convoluted at times: 'We refer to information portals used by knowledge workers as knowledge portals (or K Portals for short) to differentiate this KM role and usage from other portal roles, such as consumer shopping or business-to-business commerce.' ( Mack, et al. , 2001 ). The 'Lotus Knowledge Discovery System' ( Pohs, et al. , 2001 ) consists of a 'K-station portal', which is a system to manage 'mail, calendar, discussions, to-do items, team rooms, custom applications, and Web sites' [Lotus Domino perhaps?], the 'Discovery Server', which is 'an index to the written information and expertise that exist within an organization' and which includes 'spiders' to gather information from Notes databases, file system files, and external Web sites, and the 'K-map', which is, essentially, an information mapping and retrieval system. Of the remaining two technology oriented papers one is on the application of data-mining techniques to textual data bases, but instead of referring to this as 'text-mining', it is described as 'knowledge-mining'. The other paper is a review of the state of the art of speech recognition. Four papers have more of a social or human orientation: two deal with 'communities of practice', defined as 'a group whose members regularly engage in sharing and learning, based on their common interests' ( Lesser & Storck, 2001 ). Somewhat obviously, the authors conclude that such groups benefit the organizations of which they form part, and ought to be fostered by management. The second paper ( Gongla & Rizzuto, 2001 ) describes how such communities have been fostered in IBM. The remaining two papers in this category deal with \"human and social factors in knowledge management\" and with possibility that one's view of knowledge management is likely to be determined by one's personality type - while this argument might have some force, however, the paper is devoid of data and simply offers speculation. Even the first of these two is, in part, a thinly disguised discussion of technology, so perhaps it ought to go into the first category of technology related papers. The authors describe an experimental system at IBM called 'Babble', which 'resembles a multichannel, text-based chat system to which many users can connect, and either select from a list of conversations to participate in, or create their own.' ( Thomas, et al. , 2001 )  The authors claim that the system differs from a conventional chat system in two ways: first, by the text of the chat persisting over time so that anyone joining a chat can review the whole of what has gone before, and secondly, by representing the participants graphically so that who is present can be seen in one of the windows on the screen. Quite how this constitutes 'knowledge management' is not explained. Two of the remaining three papers deal with what we might term business processes: Fahey, et al. (2001) examine the role of knowledge management in linking e-business and operating processes, which boils down to saying that businesses need to know about their customers in order to develop the right products and the appropriate means of reaching those customers. Here, 'knowledge' is, in general, a synonym for information and, where it is not, the authors are describing ways of organizing people so that information can be shared. The second paper, on exchanging 'knowledge resources' in strategic alliances suffers from the same problem - generally, the knowledge resources turn out to be information resources, 'contracts, manuals, databases, licenses, or embedded in products' or people ( Parise & Henderson, 2001 ). The final paper in the collection is, 'Where did knowledge management come from?' ( Prusak, 2001 )  This is an interesting paper, which cleverly tries to defuse the proposition that knowledge management is nothing but a management consultancy fad, claiming that, 'knowledge management is not just a consultants' invention but a practitioner-based, substantive response to real social and economic trends'. However, no evidence is produced to support this contention, so we must assume that it is little more than management consultancy rhetoric. Ihave given this issue of IBM Systems Journal more attention than the others partly because some of the papers are genuinely interesting and partly because they are freely available on the Web. However, they reveal much of the same tendencies as in the other journals: a concern with information technology, a tendency to elide the distinction between 'knowledge' (what Iknow) and 'information' (what Iam able to convey about what Iknow), and confusion of the management of work practices in the organization with the management of knowledge."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Journal of Strategic Information Systems"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Again, we have a special issue devoted to knowledge management (and, interesting to note, no other issue in 2000 had any papers on the subject). We have here a disparate mix of papers (one is the Editorial), half of them concerned with technology. For example, one explores how artificial intelligence might help knowledge management - the general conclusion appears to be 'not a lot at present'; another, more interestingly, shows the lack of congruence between what a group of competitive intelligence analysts did and the technology being developed to help them ( Schultze & Boland, 2000 ). Two or three papers, however, deal with the 'people problems': why people do or do not help one another in communities of practice ( Wasko & Faraj, 2000 ) and how people need to share some underlying cognitive framework if they are to benefit from attempts to share information ( Merali, 2000 )."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Journal of Management Studies"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Another special issue and, again, one of the items is the Editorial. As with the other journals, one of the things that jumps out of the page is the lack of any consensus about what 'knowledge management' might be. Athoughtful paper argues that, ' knowledge is an ambiguous, unspecific and dynamic phenomenon, intrinsically related to meaning, understanding and process, and therefore difficult to manage.' and 'knowledge management is as likely, if not more so, to operate as a practice of managing people or information than as a practice attuned towards facilitating knowledge creation.' ( Alvesson & Karreman, 2001 ). Another paper, on 'dispersed knowledge' in organizations ( Becker, 2001 ) is a case of  'knowledge' being used as a synonym for information.  The remaining papers are, in effect, cases on how information is created in organizations, and how information is used to guide practice - needless to say, information in these cases is called 'knowledge' without the distinction being elucidated."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The final case is a little complicated, since the search for items in this journal published in 2001 revealed papers actually published in 1999 and 2000 - an instance, presumably, of the Association being well behind in its publication programme. Three of the papers deal with the application of expert systems to clinical decision making and call it 'knowledge management'; one ( Swoboda, et al. , 1999 ) reveals its confusion in the title: 'Knowledge management: easy access to clinical information'; and the last ( Vimarlund, et al. , 1999 ) uses 'knowledge' as a synonym for information. Anumber of points arise out of this analysis: first, it is curious that the vast majority of papers are in special issues of journals and that, in some cases, no other paper has been published on this topic in the same journal since 2001. This suggests that the topic has not entered the normal stream of papers in these journals using the same terminology - although papers on the same subjects - expert systems, decision making, decision support systems, etc., - have continued to be published. The second point reflects the first: there is absolutely no agreement on what constitutes 'knowledge management' and, in the case of the special issues there is a suspicion that the papers have adopted this terminology simply to be published in that issue. Thirdly, those papers that seriously address the question of whether knowledge can be managed generally conclude that it cannot and that the topic breaks down into the management of information and the management of work practices. On the basis of this evidence, we appear to be with Alice in the land through the looking-glass, listening to Humpty Dumpty's theory of language. Of course, the citation indexes of ISI do not index all journals and it takes a considerable length of time before they accept that a journal is worthy of inclusion. This explains the absence of, for example, the Journal of Knowledge Management , now in its sixth volume and the freely available Journal of Knowledge Management Practice ,  now in its third volume. An examination of the contents of these journals reveals the same problems with the concept of 'knowledge management' as those set out above, and the quality of some of the papers is sometimes below that of the journals surveyed here. In the case of the Journal of Knowledge Management , we are informed that it is, 'not a refereed journal in its true academic sense.' ( Emerald, n.d. ) and this may be a contributory factor."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Of course, academic researchers and teachers do not need to be 'stuck with' anything that fails to stand up to rigorous analysis, but it is interesting to see that one of the founders of 'knowledge management' is uncomfortable with the term. Turning to an older and probably better known consultant, we find that Peter Drucker, one of the first people to write about the idea of the 'knowledge society' and the 'knowledge economy' ( Drucker, 1969 ), disputes the notion that knowledge can be managed. At the Delphi Group's Collaborative Commerce Summit, Kotzer (2001) reports Drucker as follows:"}]}

It has been a very long time since Grendel's mother was on the archaeology reading list, let alone among the best sellers. The new translation has a parallel, less popular but in many respects more interesting, product from the British Library in the shape of Electronic Beowulf , a CD-Rom (or two) which provides virtual access to the medieval manuscript itself. Access to information is a modern zeitgeist. The British Library's Electronic Beowulf is part of a programme that will bring us the digital Gutenburg Bible, the electronic Magna Carta and many more. Similar projects at the Public Records Office promise to provide 'Access to Archives'. The Heritage Lottery Fund ( HLF ) and the New Opportunities Fund ( NOF ) both now fund digitisation projects, the latter spending 50 million UKP specifically to make information accessible on the Internet. These initiatives are not formulated in isolation, but form parts of wider social and economic policies. UK government policy on information aims to use this investment not simply to disseminate information, but, we are told:"}, {"tag": "blockquote", "text": "\"The Government has a mission to modernise - renewing our country for the new millennium. We are modernising our schools, our hospitals, our economy and our criminal justice system. We are modernising our democratic framework\" (Tony Blair, foreword to HMSO 1999 )."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Allied to this, ambitious policies to combat 'social exclusion' have accentuated wider issues of social and cultural regeneration, with emphasis being placed on the culture and heritage sectors as a means of engaging actively with groups disenfranchised by conventional social and economic policies (e.g. SEU 2000 ). Cultural engagement for social regeneration is paralleled by a recognition of the importance of new technologies in the economy, represented by exercises such as the Department of Trade and Industry's \" UK online for business \"\n programme. Investment in digital infrastructures will provide the foundations for a wider economic engagement, raising standards in IT skills, and providing a platform from which business can expand its use of communications technologies. For many years governments have supported industry with the infrastructure of roads, railways and ports. In the 'information age' the 'knowledge economy' will receive a similar sort of investment. This, at least is the political theory of community building on the Internet. This rhetoric is all well and good, but it seems to take us a long way from Electronic Beowulf . The point is, however, that Electronic Beowulf provides an early taste of what is to come. Once NOF, HLF and everyone else have spent their millions, then there's no question that the review pages of Internet Archaeology will be stuffed with virtual galleries, virtual museums, virtual worlds, virtually everything. Does Electronic Beowulf , support this rhetoric of access and inclusion? The history of the text of Beowulf is almost as dramatic as the adventure it narrates. The earliest manuscript (perhaps) belongs to the 11th century. After the dissolution of the monasteries, it came into the possession of Laurence Nowell. It was acquired in the 17th century by Robert Cotton, who donated it to the state in 1700. The manuscript survived fire in 1731, before being moved to the British Museum on its foundation in 1753. The charred and disintegrating remains of the manuscript were studied by the Danish scholar, G.J. Thorkelin, whose library was wrecked and papers destroyed by the Royal Navy in 1807 during the siege of Copenhagen. Collations in 1817 and 1824 demonstrate the manuscript's rapid decay before finally being conserved in 1845. It was among the first texts published as a photographic facscimile (Zupitza 1882 ), among the earliest manuscripts analysed under ultra-violet light (Smith 1938 ) and has recently been subjected to innovative fibre-optic study (Kiernan 1984 ). An ultra-violet close up of the space between two letters showing that a\n third letter was erased by the clerk who prepared the manuscript.  An\n intuitive navigation tool highlights numerous similar examples of\n damaged or erased letters that have been identified by scholars working\n on the manuscript. At the core of Electronic Beowulf is not one but several Beowulfs. The prize in some respects is the 11th century manuscript bound into the Cotton Vitellius A XV Codex, and including the other manuscripts that were bound with it, such as the Soliloquies of Saint Augustine and a fragment of the Anglo-Saxon poem Judith, which deserve more in the way of commentary than they receive. The high-resolution images are supplemented by close-up back-lit and ultra-violet images that show letters now lost to the naked eye, either because of corrections made in antiquity, or obscured during conservation. These images are presented as 'hot spots' on the text and are navigated effectively and cleanly, with a clever tool allowing the user a simple view of the manuscript or an interactive view that highlights parts of the text that have been lost or found. All this is supported by a hypertext dictionary for those of us whose Old English isn't what it ought to be, and a series of articles describing the project and the methods used to capture the text. The eleventh century manuscript can be compared to later transcriptions,\n including two transcriptions prepared by GJ Thorkelin at the end of the\n eighteenth century.  These show how the medieval manuscript has decayed,\n and allow scholars to develop a critically informed reconstruction of\n the parts of the manuscript now lost. Accompanying this complete set of high-resolution images are equally high-resolution images of four early transcriptions of the poem. Finally, there is a fifth, modern, transcription and edition that highlight the multiple and at times conflicting nature of the text. The four early transcriptions reveal the extent of decay in the manuscript. Thorkelin's two transcriptions of the 1780s contain some 900 letters that had decayed or become invisible by the time Conybeare saw the manuscript in 1817. Only seven years later, Madden's transcription shows that repeated handling of the fragile and rapidly disintegrating text had resulted in the loss of some 1,900 letters - principally from the edges of the singed manuscript. This set of transcriptions demonstrate wonderfully why Thorkelin's edition may be more useful for an historical understanding than the medieval manuscript, since this has deteriorated very badly since Thorkelin's study was published. Electronic Beowulf brings together many different versions of the text,\n including the Cotton Vitellius codex and all the important\n early transcriptions, as well as a modern transcription and edition. \n Navigation allows these different versions to be displayed\n simultaneously in a variety of forms. Thus, Electronic Beowulf is in fact six different Beowulfs. These various texts are from many different locations. Thorkelin's transcriptions are now in the Royal Library of Denmark, while the Madden version is in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. Only the Cotton Vitellius Axv manuscript and now the Conybeare transcriptions are located in the British Library, the latter only being acquired in 1994. Never before have all these texts been available in one country, let alone in one place. Now, not only can they be studied together, but they have been brought together in an environment that makes comparison a simple matter and which incorporates the results of sophisticated analytical techniques. The effort to achieve this has been phenomenal, but the result is truly staggering. Beowulf scholars and students of Old English now have unimaginable riches at their fingertips. Ionly wish Iwere such a scholar. There is a sense that while all these Beowulfs might be considerably more available, they remain as inaccessible as ever. For example, it seems truly remarkable that a volume so carefully designed, with several versions of the text and a dictionary, should be supplied without a simple translation of the text. It would not only be helpful for the interested amateur (or the list of cross-disciplinary scholars described in the introductory blurb accompanying the CD), but it could indeed support an interesting exercise in its own right. Comparing the text(s) to translation would demonstrate the necessity to return to source texts for an informed historical interpretation. Regrettably, Electronic Beowulf is only for those students of Anglo-Saxon culture already thoroughly steeped in the written language, not for historians or archaeologists who want to expand their knowledge. It is certainly not going to enthrall or enlighten the public, let alone make them better citizens. As well as a complete set of high resolution images of the medieval\n manuscript, Electronic Beowulf includes a complete modern transcription and edition\n so that students of Old English can improve their palaeography skills, by\n comparing the clean modern edition to the script of the manuscript.  Search facilities\n based on the modern edition further enhance the high resolutions images. By the same token, the specifications of the computing equipment necessary to read the texts seem excessive for a product aimed at such a wide audience. The cover notes recommend a Pentium 133 with 32mb RAM and Netscape 4.5 and a Java plug-in. The software comes bundled with the product, but suffice to say that neither my own (borrowed) laptop nor (inherited) home computer could make any sense of it, while even my relatively high specification office system struggled at times. While there are undoubtedly some very large files involved, it is hard to see why such a high threshold is necessary. Savings are certainly possible that would have made the whole thing altogether more accessible. Navigation depends largely on consistent but ponderous menus written in cumbersome Javascript. Simple HTML navigation would have sufficed for much of this. Abewildering array of frames occupy the browser from time to time, but their multiplication is often unnecessary. Afew design changes would make for an altogether less intimidating encounter. So, it is arguable that Electronic Beowulf doesn't do much to empower the public or enhance our access to these highly prized assets: it simply disenfranchises us in a new way. There is an important lesson here for the political rhetoric of access. Either we need to strain every muscle to make sure that we make materials truly accessible (by providing tools like translations), or we need to be completely open about our design goals and manage expectations accordingly (it's really only for an academic audience). The former leaves us with a lot more work on our hands, the latter will leave us with much reduced funding. In the long run, either horn of the dilemma will be more comfortable than a disillusioned and excluded public. The images will undoubtedly facilitate the preservation of the manuscript by allowing those readers already familiar with the text to address initial queries to the electronic version. Scholars who need access to the text will thus be better placed to identify the individual folios in question and thus approach the delicate manuscript more skilfully. Yet the digital copy presents its own preservation problems. Apress release associated with the CD makes alarming reading, claiming that the CD is a 'complete electronic archive'. It certainly is not that. The problems of digital archiving are beginning to be documented in slowly unfolding horror, not least by the Archaeology Data Service and its colleagues in the Arts and Humanities Data Service . Afew of the problems are witnessed here, only a few months after the CD was released (March 2000). For example, the CD contains hypertext links to the British Library web site and the University of Kentucky where much of the development took place. Some of these links are already broken (assuming that they were correct in the first place) and there is no holding page to correct these errors. This demonstrates just one reason why CD is not the ideal medium for this sort of product. Other reasons are perhaps more critical in the long term. At present there is no statutory deposit library in the UK for electronic materials, so there is no organisation mandated to maintain access to this CD-Rom in the long term. This is critical given the pace of change in digital technologies. Unscientific market research shows that computer stores in the York area sell few CD-Roms in comparison with Digital Versatile Discs. DVD's are compatible with CD's for the time being, but one can't help but think that the CD will soon join the Betamax and the Amstrad PCW in the technology which we wished we had migrated. If it were almost any organisation other than the British Library that was behind Electronic Beowulf , it would be a real cause for concern. Given recent noises from the British Library and its developing manifesto on digital preservation, Iam reassured that the data underlying this edition are indeed secure in the long term, even if the CD is not. Again, however, there is a lesson here for policy makers and aspiring cultural or heritage access programmes. When we spend millions of pounds digitising, we really only want to do it once. We certainly don't want to have to do it again in five years time. Comprehensive guidance exists for digitisation and preservation of data, most of which recommends preservation from the outset (e.g. Smith 1998 ). If we really do want to produce more CD-Roms, then we need to have some idea in mind regarding how we can make use of them in the long term too: which means we certainly need documentation and an idea of appropriate file formats. Once again, a little forethought may go a very long way. We certainly won't get the money to do this sort of digitisation work again, and will face quite an inquest if it goes wrong. The closure of the Millennium Dome at the end of 2000 has left the press looking for new scapegoats to blame for the misuse of taxpayers' money. Let's make sure we're not in their sights. Sustainability is not just a technical issue - it's a political one too. It is altogether appropriate that Beowulf be in the vanguard of digitisation. But given the extraordinary rhetoric that justifies such projects and the unrestrained expectations that surround the digital revolution, Electronic Beowulf presages a paradox of inaccessible availability.

What can Isay by\nway of excuse for this?             \nIfound the book was on sale really cheap in CostCo when we were about to  \nleave on a trip to Europe.  Ibought it for the long, long flights that     \nlay ahead of us, without knowing much about it except that it was supposed     \nto be an intellectual mystery with cryptography and symbology and stuff\nand the blurbs said it was great.  Ididn't open it, Ijust grabbed one\noff a pallet of about 500 copies.\nBarbara was between mysteries at the time, so she grabbed it from me\nand rapidly     \nread it over the next couple of days\nbefore we even left for the airport.  Iasked hopefully what it  \nwas like.  She scowled and said something about the Hardy Boys.\nMy heart sank; Iunderstood her to mean it was pathetic but\npossibly of interest to the 11-year-old market.  By the time we were\non our plane she had made sure that\nher flight bag contained a new novel by Menking         \nHannell , and over southern Oregon she told me it was great as\nusual.  Unfortunately Ihad no better idea of what to do with my time,\nso Iopened The Da Vinci Code . Iam still trying to come up with a fully convincing account of just\nwhat it was about his very first sentence, indeed the very first word,\nthat told me instantly that Iwas in for a very bad time stylistically. The Da Vinci Code may well be the only novel ever written\nthat begins with the word renowned .  Here is the paragraph\nwith which the book opens.  The scene (says a dateline under the\nchapter heading, 'Prologue') is the Louvre, late at night: Renowned curator Jacques Saunière staggered through the vaulted    \narchway of the museum's Grand Gallery.  He lunged for the nearest painting         \nhe could see, a Caravaggio.  Grabbing the gilded frame, the seventy-six-year-old\nman heaved the masterpiece toward himself until it tore from the wall and   \nSaunière collapsed backward in a heap beneath the canvas. Ithink what enabled the first word to tip me off that Iwas about to spend\na number of hours in the company of one of the worst prose stylists in the\nhistory of literature was this.  Putting curriculum vitae details into complex modifiers on proper names or definite descriptions is what you do in journalistic\nstories about deaths; you just don't do                   \nit in describing an event in a narrative.  So this might be reasonable\ntext for the opening of a newspaper report the next day: Renowned curator Jacques Saunière died last night in the Louvre\nat the age of 76. But Brown packs such details into the first two words of an action sequence — details of not only his protagonist's profession \nbut also his prestige in the field. It doesn't work here.\nIt has the ring of utter ineptitude.  The details have  \nno relevance, of course, to what is being narrated (Saunière is\nfleeing an attacker and pulls down the painting to trigger the alarm\nsystem and the security gates).  We could have deduced that he would be fairly well known in the museum trade from the fact that he was\ncurating at the Louvre. The writing goes on in similar vein, committing style and word\nchoice blunders in almost every paragraph (sometimes every line).      \nLook at the phrase \"the seventy-six-year-old man\".\nIt's a complete let-down: we knew he  \nwas a man — the anaphoric pronoun \"he\" had just been used to refer to him.      \n(This is perhaps where \"curator\" could have been slipped in for the\nfirst time, without \"renowned\", if the passage were rewritten.)\nLook at \"heaved the masterpiece toward himself until        \nit tore from the wall and Saunière collapsed backward in a heap    \nbeneath the canvas.\"  We don't need to know it's a masterpiece (it's a Caravaggio hanging in the Louvre, that should be enough in the way of           \ncredentials, for heaven's sake).  Surely \"toward him\" feels better than \"toward himself\"                      \n(though Iguess both are grammatical here).  Surely \"tore from the wall\" should\nbe \"tore away from the wall\".  Surely a single man can't fall into a\nheap (there's only him, that's not a heap).  And why repeat the name\n\"Saunière\" here instead of the pronoun \"he\"?  Who else     \nis around?  (Caravaggio hasn't been mentioned; \"a\nCaravaggio\" uses the name as an attributive modifier with conventionally\nelided head noun \"painting\".  That isn't a mention of the man.) Well, actually, there is someone else around, but we only learn that\nthree paragraphs down, after \"a thundering iron gate\" has fallen (by the\nway, it's the fall that makes a thundering noise: there's no such thing\nas a thundering gate).\n\"The curator\" (his profession is now named a second time in case you missed it) \n\"...crawled out from under the canvas and scanned the cavernous space\nfor someplace to hide\" (the colloquial American \"someplace\" seems very             \nodd here as compared with standard \"somewhere\").  Then: Avoice spoke, chillingly close. \"Do not move.\" On his hands and knees, the curator froze, turning his head slowly. Only fifteen feet away, outside the sealed gate, the mountainous           \nsilhouette of his attacker stared through the iron bars.                  \nHe was broad and tall, with ghost-pale skin and thinning white hair.    \nHis irises were pink with dark red pupils. Just count the infelicities here.\nAvoice doesn't speak —a person speaks; a voice is what a person speaks with .\n\"Chillingly close\" would be right in your ear, whereas this voice is         \nfifteen feet away behind the thundering gate.  The curator (do we really need to be\ntold his profession a third time?) cannot slowly turn his head if he\nhas frozen; freezing (as a voluntary human action) means temporarily\nceasing all muscular movements.  And crucially, a silhouette\ndoes not stare!  Asilhouette is a shadow.  If Saunière can see the man's\npale skin, thinning hair, iris color, and red pupils (all at fifteen feet),\nthe man cannot possibly be in silhouette. Brown's writing is not just bad; it is staggeringly, clumsily,\nthoughtlessly, almost ingeniously bad.  In some passages scarcely a   \nword or phrase seems to have been carefully selected or compared with\nalternatives.  Islogged through 454 pages of this syntactic swill, and\nit never gets much better.                \nWhy did Ikeep reading?  Because London Heathrow is a long way from San Francisco International,   \nand airline magazines are thin, and two-month-old Hollywood drivel on a small\nscreen hanging two seats in front of my row did not appeal, that's why.\nAnd why did Ikeep the book instead of dropping it into a Heathrow\ntrash bin?  Because it seemed to me to be such a fund of lessons\nin how not to write. Idon't think I'd want to say these things about a first-time novelist,    \nit would seem a cruel blow to a budding career.  But Dan Brown is all   \nover the best-seller lists now.  In paperback and hardback, and in many\nlanguages, he is a phenomenon.  He is up there with the Stephen Kings\nand the John Grishams and nothing Isay can conceivably harm him.  He is\na huge, blockbuster, worldwide success who can go anywhere he wants and\nneed never work again.  And he writes like the kind of freshman student             \nwho makes you want to give up the whole idea of teaching.  Never mind the ridiculous plot and the stupid anagrams and              \npuzzle clues as the book proceeds, this is a terrible, terrible example of the thriller-writer's craft. Which brings us to the question of the blurbs.  \"Dan Brown has to           \nbe one of the best, smartest, and most accomplished writers in the\ncountry,\" said Nelson DeMille, a bestselling author who has himself\nhit the #1 spot in the New York Times list.  Unbelievable\nmendacity.\nAnd there are four other similar pieces of praise on the back cover.\nTogether those blurbs convinced me to put this piece of garbage\non the CostCo cart\nalong with the the 72-pack of toilet\nrolls.  Thriller writers must have a code of honor that requires\nthat they all praise each other's new novels, a kind of omerta that enjoins them to silence about the fact that some fellow member\nof the guild has given evidence of\ntotal stylistic cluelessness.  Afraternal code of silence.  We could\ncall it...  the Da Vinci code; or the Dan Brown code."}]}

Basically, Iam the first animator on board the game and I'm the last animator to come off the game. Iwas there in the very beginning of the project, making decisions on the animation pipeline, what animations are needed in the game, how and when they should be played.  Since we have a completely different combat system from our past games, Ialso helped develop this real-time combat system.  With the help of the other members of the core group, Iplotted out the number of attacks per style, all the different reactions, and the cool combat movements shared by the different characters in the game.  Ialso helped define what the dozens of styles would be after consulting members of the Jade team, looking through different references collected from the internet, books, movies and instructional videos. Once we knew what we wanted for combat, the next step was to decide whether to continue the old tradition of hand animating every move in the game like our past games or try something called \"motion capture.\"  After the long debate between the 2 processes, we decided on using motion capture since we wanted the moves in the game especially in each martial art styles to look authentic.  Besides, it would help us go through 700+ actions quicker.  Did Isay 700+ actions?  With 30 fighting styles with around 20 - 40 moves each, add in the different damage reactions, blocks, die cycles, movements and all the exploration animations, it came out to more than 700+ actions.  Not every animation in Jade is motion captured.  Creatures, animals and monsters were still hand animated. Luckily Iwas not the only animator in the project.  As other projects were winding down and Jade's production ramping up, Ihad the pleasure of leading most of the skilled and talented animators at BioWare at least at one point in the project.  My job was to assign them different tasks and made sure that the quality of animations they produced exceeded expectations. As we are coming to the end of the production cycle, some of the animators moved to the cinematic department while others moved to new projects.  The remaining animators, including myself, are ironing out animation bugs, fixing glitches, and polishing actions.  We are also assisting with balancing the styles, and like everyone on the project, making sure that Jade Empire is engaging, fun, and one of the best games ever developed by BioWare!"}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "What challenges does the theme of Jade Empire -- one focused on martial arts and Chinese mythology -- bring to animation?"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Deo: Since the game was inspired by Ancient mythical China, it was a challenge to gather specific reference during that time.  Not only it was hard to recreate that time period but we had to create the time period if their myths and legends actually came true. The bulk of the challenge was developing a completely new combat system, different from the Baldur's Gate series, Neverwinter Nights, and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.  We wanted to immerse the player in the combat scenarios, be in control of the character in the midst of battle, and not just be a spectator.  We needed a real time combat system.  Not only that, we wanted to give the player the ability to learn different martial arts styles as he or she explores the world of Jade Empire.  So aside from coming up with a new combat system, we had to come up with more than 30 unique fighting styles-including weapons and magic with the martial arts."}, {"tag": "h4", "text": "Iimagine you're not creating all of these complex martial arts animations off the top of your head.

Igrew up in the Philippines, studying in a Filipino-Chinese school from kindergarten to high school (unfortunately, until now, Icannot speak Mandarin).  My friends then were Chinese whose parents came from either China or Taiwan.  One of my closest friends came straight from Taiwan.  While all of us were struggling learning Mandarin, he was struggling learning English and Tagalog.  Itried to recall some if not all their mannerisms, even the way my Chinese teachers taught, how they acted in a given situation and used that as reference in the game.  Working on Jade Empire makes me regret doodling during my Chinese classes instead of paying attention to some of the lessons. Second, my wife is Thai but of Chinese ethnicity.  Both her parents came from China and immigrated to Thailand.  I've been to Thailand with her a few times and observed some of her Thai/Chinese/Buddhist traditions.  Iknow Thailand is no China, but like China, its culture was untouched by western civilization.  Thanks to my wife and her family's love for Chinese soap operas, Iwas able to watch a few of them, especially those set in ancient China. Ihave studied Taekwondo, Aikido, Capoiera, and a little kung fu self defense but not enough to be a master of any.  These helped create the prototype style dubbed the \"Deo\" style.  Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, Chow Yun Fat, Donnie Yen, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi and other martial arts experts were the greatest points of reference for most of the martial arts styles.  Thanks to Jade Empire, BioWare has a DVD and VHS collection of the best martial arts movies and instructional tapes.  Ialso have to give credit to the mocap actors and stunt persons who were gracious enough to lend their talents and expertise to us.

These benefits promote more aggressive exploration of the new 3D desktop frontier. In the future, C++ bindings will be provided so that existing native applications can access the features of the LG3D platform. The LG3D API leverages the Java 3D API and provides additional features, including an animation system (to simplify writing rich user-experience applications) and APIs for 3D window manager development and interaction. The Java 3D API provides a set of object-oriented interfaces that support a simple, high-level programming model that can be used to build, render, and control the behavior of 3D objects and visual environments. Because LG3D is built on top of the Java 3D API, the platform leverages all these favorable features. Afeature subset of the Java 3D API is exposed to the client side. This enables the future possibility of running the same client application program in a resource-limited environment like a set-top box or car navigation system. Client-Server Scene Graphs The client-server Java 3D Scene Graph software allows multiple processes to share the same virtual 3D universe. This technology allows the platform to execute a LG3D-aware 3D application in a separate process (even on a remote machine), while it displays a 3D user interface integrated within the single virtual universe with which the user interacts. Like the Xclient-server model, this enables clean isolation among applications and the platform. The platform provides an abstraction layer for communication protocol. The first developer's release uses RMI for convenience. Note: Client-server here does not imply client and server machines connected through a network but rather processes typically running on the same machine. Aclient is an application that issues requests to render its user interface. Typically, the machine runs a single server that receives rendering requests from clients and constructs the screen image. Server-side Animation Execution Animation typically operates on a scene graph per frame. Amechanism to execute animation on the server side is provided, so that client and server do not need to communicate per frame. The client specifies types of animation with parameters, such as duration.The platform provides several predefined animations.

Action Adapter Classes under the actionadapter subpackage implement the Action interface and keep at least one reference to an object that implements the Action interface.

In the example, the event source to listen to is specified through the argument, which is the sourceComp Component3D object. Whenever it receives a MouseEvent from the object, it invokes the performAction method of an associated Action or Action Adapter object. In the example, a ToggleAdapter object is specified as an argument in the constructor. ToggleAdapter is an Action Adapter . It keeps an internal boolean state that gets toggled whenever the performAction method is invoked. It then invokes the performAction method of an associated object with the boolean state information. In the example, a RotateAction object is specified as an argument in the constructor. RotateAction is an Action class. The performAction method rotates the targetComp object based on the boolean argument. If it is true, it rotates the object by the given angle duration. In this case, the angle is π (pi) in radians, which is 180 degrees, within the given duration, which is 1000 milliseconds. If the argument were false, it rotate the object back to the default position, which is 0 degree. By combining this method with the ToggleAdapter object, the flipping back-and-force motion is achieved. The RotateAction object internally creates an instance of the RotationChanger class and actually performs the rotation animation. It also creates an instance of the NaturalFloatSmoother class passing the duration parameter, 1000 milliseconds. This Transition Smoother object is then given the RotationChanger object through the constructor argument for its use to perform a natural flipping motion. The RotationChanger class is one of the predefined behaviors that execute on the server side. The NaturalFloatSmoother class implements the TransitionSmoother interface, which is the key class that implements all of the natural motion you see in the LG3D demo.

The following diagram shows the relationships among those Scene Manager components and other related LG3D classes. Note that Application Container is usually invisible."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "SceneManagerBase SceneManagerBase is an implementation of SceneManager that integrates other Scene Manager components. It communicates with DisplayServerControl through the DisplayServerManagerInterface . DisplayServerControl is the main body of the LG3D Display Server module that is responsible for all the rendering that happens in the 3D space. The communication includes obtaining display-specific information like the field of view, setting view transform, and specifying the CursorModule . DisplayServerControl in turn communicates with SceneManagerBase through the SceneManager interface. The communication includes adding and removing a Frame3D object. When setActive method of Frame3D is invoked with an argument set to true, DisplayServerControl eventually receives server-side representation of the Frame3D object. The DisplayServerControl then in turn passes the object to the SceneManagerBase object. Note that the native window abstraction layer also provides a Frame3D object as the top level object with which Scene Manager interacts. In this way, there is no difference between an LG3D-aware 3D application and a 3D-mapped native window. Application Container The Application Container is a key foundation for implementing the user interaction and application navigation capabilities of Scene Manager. It is also useful for achieving two-and-a-half dimension desktop experience. The application container is a subclass of Container3D and is specialized for hosting applications, such as Frame3D objects. An application container usually leverages the 3D layout manager to implement easy-to-access application arrangements in the container. It is key to leveraging the 3D space when arranging the applications. Based on a Scene Manager implementation exercise, the 3D layout manager turned out to be a flexible platform for achieving the goal while allowing implementations to be componentized. Asingle Scene Manager can host multiple application containers. The Scene Manager implements the concept of the current application container. It receives a Frame3D object when a new LG3D-aware application is activated. The current container can be switched dynamically. This feature is typically used to implement virtual desktop switching. The Background In the LG3D 3D desktop environment, the background is more than just a static image behind application windows. It actually defines the 3D environment with which the user can interact and where application containers can be positioned. The Background can comprise any 3D geometry as it is a subclass of Container3D , to which any geometry can be added and any behavior can be integrated. In addition to setting up the geometry to render on the background, the Background object also hosts application containers. The object usually keeps a reference to a SceneManager object that is passed through the initialize method, and invokes the SceneManager object to manage application containers including obtaining and switching current. Since Application Container is just a subclass of Container3D , the background object can place it anywhere in the 3D scene. It also can allow the user to handle multiple application containers by switching the current application container and changing the view so that the current one remains accessible to the user. For more details, you may want to check out the SimpleImageBackground class, which is a simple example implementation of background with comments. Global Lights Light is also componentized. Instead of a static global light that the default implementation provides (StandardGlobalLights), you can develop lights that dynamically change angle and color based on time of the day, for example. Or, a Scene Manager may want to use lighting effects to provide an alert or focus to the user. Cursor Module A CursorModule class implements policies on how cursor is displayed. It provides Scene Manager hooks for the addition and removal of Cursor3D objects, and a hook for positioning the current cursor. For example, in the default implementation StandardCursorModule , the maximum distance of the current cursor from the user's point of view is limited to a certain value so that the cursor will appear to the user at a reasonable size. Without this policy, a cursor could be drawn so far away on the surface of the background that the user would have difficulty finding it."}, {"tag": "div", "text": "Interaction Events Between Frame3D and Scene Manager"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The generic event system is employed as the main communication method between Frame3D and Scene Manager, to achieve both loosely coupled componentization and the interplay of a rich set of user actions and requests between them.

Since these interfaces are not a part of the client API and not visible to client application developers, this document does not cover any details. The Native Window representation module sits on top of the FWS, and provides abstracted representation of native window application's visual aspect. It is in the org.jdesktop.lg3d.displayserver.nativewindow package. Its two primary design goals are to Allow a pluggable Look and Feel Encapsulate complexity around native window capture and communication The classes in this package attempt to abstract and hide all the complexity around the native application visual capture, as well as necessary communication with the application side. Figure 8 illustrates the relationships among the major classes. NativeWindow3D is the top level class with which SceneManager interacts. It extends Frame3D and behaves just like another LG3D-aware 3D application. It also implements the methods declared in NativeWindowMonitor , which are used for the native 2D window manager to give notifications about status changes, and so on. The implementation, in turn, uses NativeWindowControl interface to communicate back to the native window manager, so that it can perform actions on the 2D application\nassociated with this object. NativeWindowLookAndFeel defines the native window's appearance and visual texture. At this level, typically, window decoration is constructed. The current implementation includes GlassyNativeWindowLookAndFeel in the lg3d.scenemanager.utils.decoration package as an example. NativeWindowObject and TiledNativeWindowImage exist to hide all the complexity related to native window capture support. Texture is used for presenting captured 2D window surfaces in the 3D space, but it has a size limitation that is sometimes smaller than maximum 2D window size. To deal with large 2D window capture, we use composite multiple textures created from a set of ImageComponent2Ds .

Funny that the Food Network is pushing the whole “Los Angeles detective” bit. It makes it seem like they want people to think LAPD. Idid, anyway, at first. Guess it sounds sexier, as well as more recognizable, than South Bay. Here’s some of the web site content – they use the police angle a little cheesily, but hey, it’s a theme and if anyone can understand a theme – it’s me! : “His name is Chris Cognac, and he works two beats: he's a true-blue police detective in Los Angeles AND he's the food critic for his local paper, guiding readers to hidden gem restaurants in his hometown. Now, Chris is leaving his jurisdiction for cities across America, on a mission to uncover the best off-the-beaten-path restaurants in each place that only the locals know. Using all of his detective skills and trusty informants along the way, Chris will teach viewers how to uncover clues to hidden gem eateries in any town.” Ihaven’t watched the show yet, though Idid watch a few of the online clips previewing segments and interviewing Detective Cognac. Looks like it could be fun. Let me know if anyone else out there has caught it. And as they say… who knows local food better than the local police? Itotally agree!

Different communities or domains have developed their own standardized\r\nmetadata vocaularies to meet their specific needs.

The transformation\r\nlanguage XSLT (which acts independently of the formatting language) provides\r\nelements that define rules for how one XML document is transformed into\r\nanother XML document. The transformed XML document may use the markup and\r\nDTD of the original document or it may use a completely different set of\r\ntags. The ability of XSLT to transform data from one XML representation\r\nto another makes it appear to be ideal for metadata interchange applications. An XSL document contains a list of templates and rules. Atemplate rule\r\nhas a pattern specifying the trees it applies to and a template to be output\r\nwhen the pattern is matched. When an XSL processor formats an XML document\r\nusing an XSL style sheet, it scans the XML document tree looking through\r\neach sub-tree in turn. As each tree in the XML document is read, the processor\r\ncompares it with the pattern of each template rule in the style sheet.\r\nWhen the processor finds a tree that matches a template rule's pattern,\r\nit outputs the rule's template. This template generally includes some markup,\r\nsome new data and some data copied out of the tree from the original XML\r\ndocument. Using XSLT and the Xalan [33] XSLT processor we developed\r\nXSL programs for transforming the ABC description above to DC, ID3 and\r\nMPEG-7 descriptions, respectively. Appendix Bshows the resulting XSL files. The mapping implementations in Appendix Brevealed\r\nthat although XSLT works well for the structural mapping from an event\r\nmodel to a resource-centric model based on the set of rules described in\r\nSection 3.1, it is inadequate for implementing flexible dynamic semantic\r\nmappings between metadata vocabularies. This is due to: XSLT's limited capabilities for handling variable input descriptions based\r\non schemas which are not tightly constrained; The non-existence of machine-understandable semantic information in declarative\r\nXML-encoded metadata descriptions; Processor-dependent handling of input parameters and procedural code extensions; Limited string manipulation and comparison functions, e.g. it is not possible\r\nto perform case-insensitive string comparisons within XSLT. The mappings revealed that if the input XML descriptions are relatively\r\nfixed and tightly constrained, then the semantic mappings can be hardwired\r\nand XSLT is adequate. But if the input descriptions are at all variable\r\nor unpredictable (e.g. undefined domain specific sub-classing and attributes)\r\nthen XSL simply cannot cope. Cawsey investigated the use of XSLT for customizing\r\nRDF descriptions, reaching similar conclusions. [34] Below are listed a number of possible approaches to handling the semantic\r\nmapping problem. The approach chosen is a balance between simplicity on\r\nthe one hand, and flexibility or scalability on the other. The wider the\r\ntargeted scope of interoperability, the more difficult it is to achieve\r\naccurate, precise mappings. Below is a list of mapping approaches in increasing\r\norder of both scope and difficulty: Hardwire crosswalks between metadata terms from specific metadata domains\r\n(easy, but only works for fixed input); Extract mappings from a pre-defined multiple-domain mapping matrix; Determine the semantic mappings from a metadata term ontology; Determine the semantic mappings from a generic ontology such as WordNet; Determine the semantic mappings from a dynamically generated ontology created\r\nby using inferencing to merge multiple domain-specific ontologies. By reducing the scope of the problem to interoperability between existing\r\nmetadata standards, then the fully generic approaches (e.g., 4 and 5 above)\r\nbecome unnecessarily complex.

For the sake of simplicity, we\r\nhave chosen only to model the BTG/NTG relation (a common practice among\r\nthesauri developers) and the equivalence relation, and not to include associative\r\nrelations within MetaNet. The ISO5964 standard for the documentation and establishment of multilingual\r\nthesauri [8] identifies the following types of interthesaurus\r\nrelations: exact equivalence partial equivalence single to multiple equivalence inexact equivalence. These relations indicate that the semantic relations between terms from\r\ndifferent metadata vocabularies are likely to be much more complex than\r\none-to-one exact equivalence and that even \"exact equivalence\" will be\r\nan approximation. However, because the scope of our problem is limited\r\nto relations between terms in a number of standardized English metadata\r\nvocabularies, then we can expect the frequency of more complex mappings\r\nto be less than for general natural language thesauri. For the first draft\r\nof MetaNet, we decided only to consider exact and partial equivalence relations\r\nand to combine them in the ET relation which defines equivalent/overlapping\r\nterms. If two different domains use two different metadata terms which\r\nare ETs in our thesaurus then we make the assumption that the domains are\r\nreferring to semantically equivalent concepts. Consequently the metadata term thesaurus which we have developed, MetaNet [4] ,\r\ncontains only preferred terms (the ABC core vocabulary), equivalent/overlapping\r\nterms (ET), narrower terms (NT) and broader terms (BT), and attempts to\r\nencompass terms from the most significant and widely-used metadata vocabularies\r\n(Dublin Core, IFLA, IEEE LOM, INDECS)."}, {"tag": "h3", "text": "8.2 Description of MetaNet"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The objective of the MetaNet thesaurus is to provide the semantic\r\nknowledge required to enable machine understanding of equivalence and hierarchical\r\n(subtyping) relationships between metadata terms from different domains.\r\nThe scope of this thesaurus is limited to the most significant metadata\r\nmodels/vocabularies used for describing attributes and events associated\r\nwith resources and their life cycles. This encompasses metadata vocabularies\r\nfrom the bibliographic, museum, archival, record keeping and rights management\r\ncommunities. It has been developed by performing WordNet [36] searches using the core terms from the ABC vocabulary, and extracting those\r\nsynonyms and hyponyms which could conceivably be used in a metadata scheme\r\nto represent the original core term. In addition, the results have been\r\ncompared with the vocabularies of the DC, INDECS, IFLA, IMS and CIDOC CRM\r\nvocabularies to check that the majority of the terms used in these metadata\r\ndictionaries have been incorporated into the thesaurus. Amachine-readable RDF Schema representation of this thesaurus has been\r\ndeveloped. [37] The RDF and RDF Schema elements, Class , subClassOf , property , subPropertyOf are used to define the hierarchical/subtyping and\r\nentity/attribute relationships between metadata elements. The RDFS label element is used to specify semantically equivalent terms which may be used.\r\nThe ABC core vocabulary is used as the top-level set of preferred terms.\r\nAlthough this thesaurus has been generated manually, it could conceivably\r\nbe generated automatically by using inferencing mechanisms to merge RDF\r\nSchemas from different domains, as has been proposed in the Ontology Inference\r\nLayer (OIL). [30] For example, consider \"Agent\", which is a core term of the ABC vocabulary\r\nand hence a preferred term in the MetaNet thesaurus. Semantically equivalent\r\nterms for \"Agent\", commonly used within other metadata vocabularies, include: actor, contributor, creator, player, doer, worker, performer Possible narrower terms or hyponyms for \"Agent\" include: author, composer, artist, musician, . . etc. Table 2 is an excerpt from the RDF Schema which illustrates the representation\r\nfor the \"Agent\" metadata term as well as its equivalent terms and a partial\r\nhierarchy of its narrower terms.

Flexible\r\nsemantic mapping is only possible with the assistance of semantic knowledge\r\nbases provided by ontologies or thesauruses such as the MetaNet thesaurus\r\ndescribed above. The MetaNet thesaurus described here is a first draft English version,\r\nbased on the vocabulary of the ABC model. Although it has only been applied\r\nto a relatively small sample set, some of the limitations of this thesaurus\r\nare already evident. These include its inability to support metadata vocabularies\r\nwhich use: Tokens, e.g. ID3 tags such as TPE2, which are semantically meaningless.\r\nThis limitation can be overcome by either explicitly including such tags\r\nin the thesaurus or searching the definitions (rather than element names)\r\nin the output namespace for the input element name or its semantically\r\nequivalent terms; Abbreviations, e.g. acc.no.; Qualifers or hybrid words joined by a variety of connectors, e.g. UserClass,\r\nAssistant Editor, Art_Director, Time-span. This problem can be solved to\r\nsome extent by including \"associated terms\" in the thesaurus and by ignoring\r\ntypical \"connectors\". In addition, the inherently ambiguous nature of language leads to the following\r\nproblems: Metadata terms with multiple possible meanings, e.g.\"condition\" - this\r\ncould be the current state of an object or it could be a restriction on\r\nthe permissable use of a resource. This can be overcome by the use of unambiguous\r\nmetadata terms by schema designers. Multiple possible spellings for the same word, e.g. artefact/artifact,\r\ncolour/color. This thesaurus is based on nouns, e.g. \"creator\", \"publisher\", and does\r\nnot search for related verbs, adverbs, adjectives in various tenses which\r\ncould be used to express the same semantics, e.g. \"created_by\", \"published_by\".\r\nThis problem could, to some extent, be overcome through the use of stemming. Currently only English is supported. However, we believe that this thesaurus\r\ncould be extended to provide equivalent or overlapping terms for the ABC\r\nvocabulary in other languages by following the recommendations specified\r\nin ISO5964.

We intend carrying out more extensive evaluation of both the ABC model\r\nand the hybrid mapping approach, by applying them to metadata tranformations\r\nbetween large sets of sample records provided by a number of different\r\nCIMI [38] member organisations. The plan is to build\r\na testbed using multimedia museum resources and metadata descriptions provided\r\nby CIMI members and to use this testbed to implement and evaluate metadata\r\ninteroperability between different museums' descriptions. The Harmony ABC model exhibits many similarities with the CIDOC Conceptual\r\nReference Model (CRM) [21] , a domain ontology developed\r\nby the CIDOC Committee of the International Council of Museums. In the\r\nnear future we plan to investigate the possible merging of the Harmony\r\nmodel and the CIDOC CRM model into a single ontology. We plan to use the\r\nCIMI testbed described above to evaluate the \"super\" ontology resulting\r\nfrom harmonization of these two models. The mapping implementations above have all involved mapping from an\r\nevent-aware metadata model to a resource-centric metadata model. We are\r\nalso interested in the rules and mechanisms required for machine translations\r\nbetween metadata descriptions based on different event-aware metadata models,\r\ne.g. from ABC to INDECS or CIDOC CRM. We would also like to investigate mapping between \"application profiles\"\r\nor schemas which mix metadata elements imported from multiple different\r\nnamespaces. The test examples considered so far only present the problem\r\nof mapping from a single domain's metadata description to another single\r\ndomain's metadata description, e.g. pure DC to pure MPEG-7. Asituation\r\nthat will become increasingly common in the future is the need to map from\r\na schema which imports elements from multiple namespaces to another schema\r\nwhich imports a different set of elements from multiple namespaces. In\r\naddition, each schema may impose its own local structural constraints, e.g. parent/child relationships cardinality/occurrence constraints datatyping, enumeration and formatting constraints on the element values. We believe the approach proposed in this paper will support mapping between\r\nmixed-domain \"application profiles\", but need to test this through further\r\nresearch involving machine translations between metadata descriptions which\r\nconform with both complex local usage constraints, (defined by XML Schemas [39] ),\r\nas well as namespace-specific semantic definitions (defined by RDF Schemas)."}, {"tag": "h2", "text": "Acknowledgements"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "The author acknowledges the valuable contributions which discussions with\r\nDan Brickley, Carl Lagoze, Martin Doerr and Sigge Lundberg have made to\r\nthis work.

Bailey - Appendix - The Principles of the\r\n    Arcane School I. The Arcane School is a Training School for\r\n    Disciples"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "At the close of the world war (1914-1945) the Arcane School had been\r\n    in existence for nearly 25 years and had, in that time, serviced over 20,000 people. Its\r\n    curriculum is progressive; step by step the studies deepen and the meditation work becomes\r\n    more intensive as the student passes from one degree to another. No teaching is given at any time in the development of the psychic powers; people are\r\n    not taught to be clairvoyant or clairaudient; no training is given in magic or in the use\r\n    of magical rituals, and nothing is taught at any stage on sex magic. Our whole emphasis is\r\n    laid upon spiritual living, upon the mental grasp of the occult teaching and upon those\r\n    rules and processes which will bring about right relations to one's fellowmen, right\r\n    relation to one's own soul, right relation to the Spiritual Hierarchy (of which the Christ\r\n    is the Supreme Head), and right relation to a Master and His ashram, or group. Because the Arcane School is designed solely to train people to be conscious, working\r\n    disciples, its curriculum is definitely eliminative. The work you are asked to do is not\r\n    easy, nor is it intended to be easy. The standard maintained and desired is high and the\r\n    work is planned in such a way that those whose mental equipment and spiritual aspiration\r\n    are inadequate to the requirements automatically drop out; they find, for themselves, that\r\n    they cannot cope with the work. We never encourage people to stay in the work unless they\r\n    show fitness, for they only get discouraged and labor under a sense of failure and this is\r\n    bad for all concerned. Discipleship entails a loving heart and a keen, alert mind. The loving heart has always\r\n    been emphasized, plus devotion, by the churches and the esoteric groups. This is a basic\r\n    truth and necessity, but a keen, alert and trained mind is of equal importance. The\r\n    Masters reach the world of men through their disciples; that is the way They choose to\r\n    work. They are seeking, therefore, intelligent, [283] self-controlled men and women - with\r\n    vision and with a self-imposed, spiritual discipline - through whom that work can be\r\n    carried forward. Intentionally, therefore, we make the work difficult and keep the\r\n    standard of requirements high because we, too, are looking for people who can use their\r\n    minds or who show at least a willingness to develop and use their mental processes.\r\n    The need of the more emotional and aspirational types and of the devotees can well be met\r\n    in other groups and esoteric schools, and is thus being met. Running\r\n    through all the work of the Arcane School is the theme of service. Service to one's\r\n    fellowmen is the hallmark of a disciple and the key also which opens for him the door of\r\n    initiation. Therefore, all who enter the School and face the new cycle of training find us\r\n    saying to them: Study, think and prove to yourself and to us that you have grasped the\r\n    teaching by writing your study papers; learn to meditate and so make a contact with your\r\n    true spiritual Self, the soul, and make service the expression of what you know. These\r\n    three things should be your main spiritual preoccupation during the time spent in the\r\n    earlier degrees. You will find that, as each year slips away, your grasp of the way into\r\n    the Hierarchy grows steadily and your entire life will be taking on fuller and richer\r\n    meaning. It is the world of meaning that we are trying to penetrate. You will then find\r\n    that the succeeding degrees will open their doors to you, for you will be found to have\r\n    covered the necessary preliminary work, to have assimilated a certain measure of technical\r\n    and academic knowledge, to have certain spiritual contacts and arrived at certain great\r\n    recognitions."}]}

The cycle which Christ inaugurated has been one in which men have\r\n    become strictly human. Up till that Incarnation there had always been those who, having\r\n    achieved humanity, had then passed on to demonstrate divinity. But now the whole race is\r\n    at the point of so doing. Although today men are predominantly animal-emotional, yet\r\n    through the success of the evolutionary process - leading as it has to our widespread\r\n    educational systems and the general high level of mental awareness - men have reached the\r\n    point where the masses themselves, given proper encouragement, can \"enter into the\r\n    kingdom of God.\" Who can say that it is not this realization, dim and uncertain as it\r\n    may be, which prompts the universal unrest and the widespread determination to better\r\n    conditions? That we interpret the kingdom of God in terms of the material is inevitable at\r\n    first, but it is a hopeful and spiritual sign that we are today so [192] busy cleaning\r\n    house, and thus attempting to raise the level of our civilization. Christ incarnated when,\r\n    for the first time, humanity was a complete whole, as far as the form side its nature was\r\n    concerned, with all the qualities manifesting - physical, psychic and mental - which\r\n    distinguish the human animal. He brought to us a manifestation of what the perfect man\r\n    could be who, regarding that form side as the temple of God, but recognizing his innate\r\n    divinity, strives to bring it to the foreground, first of all in his own consciousness and\r\n    then before the world. This Christ did. The mysteries had always been revealed to the\r\n    individual who fitted himself to penetrate into a hidden arcanum or temple, but Christ\r\n    revealed them to humanity as a whole, and enacted the whole drama of the God-Man before\r\n    the race. This was His major achievement, and this we have forgotten - the living Christ -\r\n    in the emphasis we have laid upon man himself, on his relation to himself as a sinner, and\r\n    to God as the One against Whom he has sinned."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "Again, every great organization or group\r\n    religion or cult of any kind has originated with a person, and from that person the idea\r\n    has spread out into the world, gathering adherents as time elapsed. Christ in this way\r\n    precipitated the kingdom of God upon earth. It had always existed in the heavenly places.\r\n    He caused it to materialize, thus becoming a fact to the consciousness of men. Preparedness for the Kingdom, and the arrival of the time when men in large numbers\r\n    could be initiated into the mysteries, required from them a recognition of an unworthiness\r\n    and a sinfulness which only the development of the mind could give. The age of\r\n    Christianity has been an age of mental unfoldment. It has been an age also wherein much\r\n    emphasis has been laid upon sin and evil doing. There is no consciousness of sin in the\r\n    animals, though there may be indications of a conscience among the domesticated animals,\r\n    due to their association with man. Mind produces the power to analyze a observe, to\r\n    differentiate and distinguish; and so with the [193] advent of mental development there\r\n    has been, for a long time, a growing sense of sinfulness, of contrition, and of an almost\r\n    abject attitude to the Creator, producing in humanity that strongly marked inferiority\r\n    complex with which today psychologists have to deal. Against this sense of sin, with its\r\n    concomitants of propitiation, at-one-ment and the sacrifice of Christ for us, there has\r\n    been a revolt; and in this really wholesome reaction there is the normal tendency to go\r\n    too far. Fortunately, we are never able to get too far from divinity; and that, as a race,\r\n    we shall swing back into a state of greater spirituality than ever before is the sincere\r\n    belief of all who know. Theology over-reached itself with its \"miserable sinner\"\r\n    complex and its emphasis upon the necessity for the purification by blood. This teaching\r\n    of purification through the blood of bulls and of rams (or lambs) was part of the ancient\r\n    mysteries, and was inherited by us primarily from the Mysteries of Mithra. These\r\n    mysteries, in their turn, inherited the teaching, and thus formulated their doctrine,\r\n    which Christianity absorbed. When the sun was in the zodiacal sign of Taurus the Bull, the\r\n    sacrifice of the bull was offered as a forecast of that which Christ came later to reveal.\r\n    When the sun passed (in the precession of the equinoxes) into the next sign, that of Aries\r\n    the Ram, we find the lamb was sacrificed and the scapegoat sent into the wilderness.\r\n    Christ was born into the next sign, Pisces the Fishes, and it is for this reason that we\r\n    eat fish on Good Friday, in commemoration of His coming. Tertullian, one of the early\r\n    Church Fathers, speaks of Jesus Christ as the \"Great Fish,\" and of us, His\r\n    followers, as the \"little fishes.\" These facts are well known, as the following\r\n    extract will indicate: \"The\r\n      ceremonies of purification by the sprinkling or drenching of the novice with the blood of\r\n      bulls or rams were widespread, and were to be found in the rites of Mithra. By this\r\n      purification a man was 'born again' and the Christian expression 'washed in the blood of\r\n      the Lamb' is undoubtedly a reflection of this idea, the reference thus being clear in the\r\n      words of the Epistle to the Hebrews: 'It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of\r\n      goats should take away [194] sins.' In this passage the writer goes on to say: 'Having\r\n      boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he\r\n      hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say his flesh... let us draw near...\r\n      having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure\r\n      water.' But when we learn that the Mithraic initiation ceremony consisted in entering\r\n      boldly into a mysterious underground 'holy of holies' with the eyes veiled, and there\r\n      being sprinkled with blood, and washed with water, it is clear that the author of the\r\n      Epistle thinking of those Mithraic rites with which everybody at that time must have been\r\n      so familiar.\" - The Paganism in Our Christianity , by Arthur Weigall, pp. 132, 133. Christ came\r\n    to abolish these sacrifices by showing us their true meaning, and in His Person as perfect\r\n    man He died the death of the Cross to show us (in picture form and through actual\r\n    demonstration) that divinity can be manifested and can truly express itself only when man,\r\n    as man, has died in order that the hidden Christ may live. The lower carnal nature (as St.\r\n    Paul loved to call it) must die in order that the higher divine nature may show forth in\r\n    all its beauty. The lower self must die in order that the higher self can manifest on\r\n    earth. Christ had to die in order that once and for all mankind might learn the lesson\r\n    that by the sacrifice of the human nature the divine aspect might be \"saved.\"\r\n    Thus Christ summed up in Himself the significance of all the past world sacrifices. That\r\n    mysterious truth which had been revealed only to the pledged and trained initiate when he\r\n    was ready for the fourth initiation was given out by Christ to the world of men. He\r\n    died for all so that all might live. But this is not the doctrine of the vicarious\r\n    at-one-ment which was pre-eminently St. Paul's interpretation of the Crucifixion, but the\r\n    doctrine which Christ Himself taught - the doctrine of divine immanence (see St. John\r\n    XVII), and the doctrine of the God-Man. Christianity inherited many of its interpretations, and the teachers and interpreters\r\n    of the early Christian times were no more free from the thralldom of ancient beliefs than\r\n    are we [195] from the interpretations given to Christianity during the past two thousand\r\n    years. Christ did give us the teaching that we must die in order to live as Gods, and\r\n    therefore He died. He did sum up in Himself all the traditions of the past for He\r\n    \"not only fulfiled the Judaic Scriptures, but He also fulfiled those of the pagan\r\n    world, and therein lay the great appeal of early Christianity. In Him a dozen shadowy Gods\r\n    were condensed into a proximate reality; and in His crucifixion the old stories of their\r\n    ghastly at-oning sufferings and sacrificial deaths were made actual and given a direct\r\n    meaning.\" (Ibid., p. 166.) But His death was also the consummating act of a life of\r\n    sacrifice and service, and the logical outcome of His teaching. Pioneers and those who\r\n    reveal to men their next step, those who come forth as the interpreters of the divine\r\n    Plan, inevitably are repudiated, and usually die as the result of their courageous\r\n    pronouncements. To this rule Christ was no exception. \"Advanced Christian thinkers\r\n    now regard the Crucifixion of our Lord as the supreme sacrifice made by Him for the sake\r\n    of the principles of His teaching. It was the crowning act of His most heroic life, and it\r\n    affords such a sublime example to mankind that meditation upon it may be said to produce a\r\n    condition of at-one-ment with the Fountainhead of all goodness.\" (Ibid., p. 166.)"}]}
{"file_number": "95", "plaintext": [{"tag": "p", "text": "MY COMRADE AND MY BROTHER: These are two appellations which are sincere and intended. You are at this time facing\r\n    changes. The choice with which you are confronted is not so much where you will work, but\r\n    whether you have arrived at a high water mark in your developed life of service and can\r\n    therefore go no further, or whether there are still to be found in you those springs of\r\n    interest and those inner urges which will enable you to reach outward and further into the\r\n    life of the spirit. [502] Such is oft the choice with which the disciple is faced who\r\n    reaches close to the three score years and ten of ordinary human enterprise, as you do\r\n    today. The difficulty lies in the fact that, fundamentally, either decision is right. Few,\r\n    however, face the choice consciously or intelligently or, having made it, abide by the\r\n    decision made. From the standpoint of the ordinary aspirant, the choice is relatively\r\n    unimportant because the time equation is of no great moment at this stage; a few years\r\n    more or less are of no import in the eternity of soul reaction. Therefore, a decision to\r\n    relax, to hold the point gained, but to refrain from further struggle, has in it no room\r\n    for criticism. Remember this. From the\r\n    standpoint of the accepted disciple - such as you are - there may be more to the choice\r\n    than at first appears. It might be of service to you, and to all who may later read these\r\n    instructions, if Idwelt for a moment upon the inevitable problem of the working disciple,\r\n    upon the problem of the man who reaches the age which you have reached. Shall he rest back\r\n    upon his laurels (and you have laurels, my brother, as Ipointed out in my last\r\n    instruction to you) or shall he - to use a Biblical phrase - \"gird his loins\"\r\n    anew and go forward with a fresh impetus and to a still higher summit of attainment? Shall\r\n    he demonstrate the power of the seventh wave which will carry him forward much further\r\n    upon the beach of life expression or will the strong undertow of ordinary human frailty\r\n    pull him back from renewed effort? The reasons why a disciple must at least endeavor not to relax unduly and should push\r\n    on in spite of fatigue (the fatigue of years of living), in spite of the increasing\r\n    \"creaking\" of the human apparatus and the inevitable tendency which comes from\r\n    constant service and constant contact with others, might be enumerated as follows: He must endeavor to carry the rhythm of service and of fruitful living with him when -\r\n        free of the physical body - he stands upon the other side of the veil. There must be no\r\n        gap in that service. He must endeavor as far as in him lies to preserve the [503] continuity of his\r\n        consciousness as a working disciple and should allow no gap to emerge between his\r\n        present point of tension and that point of tension which supervenes after the death\r\n        experience. He must endeavor to close the episode of this life experience so that it is apparent\r\n        that he is a member of an Ashram; he must permit no break in the established relationship,\r\n        or any cessation to the flow of ashramic life through him to the world of men. This\r\n        activity, on account of the natural and normal deterioration of the physical vehicle as it\r\n        grows older, is not so easy a task; it requires a definite concentration of effort, thus\r\n        increasing the tension in which a disciple ever lives. For any disciple in my Ashram, the problem in this time of world crisis is peculiarly\r\n        urgent, and this for the following reasons: My Ashram is the main affiliated Ashram with that of the Master K.H. To him, my Master\r\n            (as Iam yours), is given the task, on a large scale, of world education along new lines.\r\n            Through my Ashram, working under the inspiration of his, the newer, esoteric presentation\r\n            of truth is to be given out. The work that Ihave already done - through my books and\r\n            through all the teaching which you have attempted to embody - is to render the teaching of\r\n            the other and older esoteric schools and groups entirely exoteric. There is little left to\r\n            them that is new; they must now link up with the sources which Irepresent if their\r\n            leaders are to present fresh and vital information to their students, or they must take\r\n            what Ihave conveyed to the world, via A.A.B., and thus again reintegrate into the\r\n            esoteric whole. Disciples in my Ashram have a dual responsibility to stand steady in a preservation\r\n            of realization - if Imay use such a phrase. This steadiness must not be\r\n            relaxed in any way as old age draws near, and it must not be permitted to disappear\r\n            through the transition of death itself. It is through the [504] unbroken conscious\r\n            thinking of a welded group of disciples that the Master of an Ashram works. It is not so\r\n            much the active outer service of a group of disciples which is of major importance (though\r\n            it has necessarily a vital purpose) as the coherent, integrated group thought which is so\r\n            potent in effecting changes in the human consciousness. The peculiar problem of the present world crisis and the terrific readjustments in the\r\n            human consciousness, incident to the inauguration of a new culture, civilization and world\r\n            religion, warrant my presenting the members of my Ashram (even affiliated groups, such as\r\n            yours) with the opportunity to preserve intact and free from all deterioration their\r\n            \"state of mind\" throughout the remaining years of this life, through the process\r\n            of dissolution, and on into the freedom of the other side of the veil. This preservation\r\n            of conscious integrity is no easy task; it requires understanding and most deliberate\r\n            effort. Icall you, therefore, my brother, to exactly this effort. The consequences to you will\r\n    be a much harder life of service from now on; the results will be the carrying out of your\r\n    plans for work with greatly intensified effort. You should now work in closer cooperation with A.A.B. and F.B. The task of carrying\r\n    esoteric truth into Latin and Catholic America and southern Europe is no easy undertaking.\r\n    It will be slow. Your foundation must be well and truly laid. The quality of those reached\r\n    by you in the future is of more importance than the quantity. Bear this ever in mind.\r\n    Relinquish not the various phases of the work you have so successfully launched, but\r\n    proceed with them as heretofore - no matter where may be the place of your physical plane\r\n    enterprise. One of the many things which you need at this time to learn, and which you must\r\n    initiate during the next few years, is how to gather people together and work through\r\n    them. This, as you have been taught, is very difficult for a first ray disciple to master,\r\n    particularly when the soul ray  [505] and the ray of the astral or emotional nature\r\n    are both first ray. It is easy for the first ray disciple to withdraw into his soul\r\n    consciousness, far easier than for any other ray types, and your problem (as it is also\r\n    the problem of J.W.K-P.) is to give the second ray personality fuller sway, and thus\r\n    balance the first ray ability to demonstrate detachment by the functioning of the opposite\r\n    quality of attachment - so distinctive of the second ray nature. Ponder on this. As Itold\r\n    J.W.K-P. some years ago, a \"detached attachment\" (paradoxical as it sounds) is\r\n    the goal of the first ray working disciple. This is equally true of you. You and he have\r\n    the same egoic, personality and mental rays. Hence the close link with him which you have\r\n    ever realized. He is a disciple of the Master M., temporarily working in my Ashram. You\r\n    have been admitted into the ranks of accepted disciples in my Ashram and by me, but you\r\n    will eventually be transferred into the Ashram of the Master M. The free interplay thus\r\n    established between my Ashram and that of the Master M. is due to the fact that he is the\r\n    inner Head of all esoteric groups, and in the interest of the coming new world order, the\r\n    teaching Ashrams are being strengthened by the inflow of first ray disciples. This should\r\n    be a point of real interest to you. What, my brother, shall be the type of meditation and interior work which you should be\r\n    doing during the coming years? Iwould like to have you meditate upon the \"three\r\n    activities\": Outward moving, persistent orientation, and interior withdrawing or\r\n    abstraction. The relation of these three activities or three attitudes should form\r\n    one aspect of your reflection upon these phrases; the relative activity involved in each\r\n    attained position should constitute another; the effect produced by each of them in the\r\n    three worlds, and also upon soul levels, demands careful and concentrated thought. What,\r\n    for instance, is the nature of \"outward moving\" upon the astral plane? How would\r\n    \"persistent orientation\" appear or express itself upon the mental plane? Or\r\n    \"abstraction and withdrawal\" upon the physical level of consciousness? How can\r\n    you, as a disciple, display these attitudes simultaneously? Ithink you will admit, my\r\n    brother, that in these three [506] concepts and in their working out in the daily life\r\n    within the ring-pass-not of the three worlds and in the life of the soul upon its own\r\n    plane, Ihave given you the theme for much thinking during the coming years. Take each of\r\n    these phrases, therefore, and think each of them out in relation to each of the three\r\n    planes in the three worlds, and to each other; carry the same directed thinking on to soul\r\n    levels and shift the theme then into the three worlds of the Spiritual Triad, regarding\r\n    the lower three worlds then as reflections of the higher, triadal three. Keep notes of all\r\n    the thoughts of reality which come to you;. watch the reactions produced in your vehicles\r\n    of expression, and become increasingly aware of the changes which conscious, deliberate\r\n    thinking will bring about in you. Think - if Imay so express it - in your heart, and also\r\n    in your mind, and endeavor to comprehend the distinction between these two modes of\r\n    thought. This\r\n    reflective work should constitute your meditation work in the future; it will condition\r\n    your interior development and will also inevitably make your outer work more dynamic. One reason why Ihave emphasized the need for attachment in this instruction is that\r\n    right attachment releases the love of the soul, and only love, consciously, intelligently\r\n    and deliberately applied, can make for successful work, both in Europe and South America -\r\n    your two recognized fields of service. Only your second ray personality will have the\r\n    capacity to reawaken contact with your students in Spain or hold steady those already\r\n    working in South America; it is through individually refound, reawakened and reinspired\r\n    realization that the work, planned and intended by me, can be successfully carried\r\n    forward. Such is your immediate task. Only your second ray personality can have the\r\n    patience to cover the mass of detail needed and to persist in the face of appa r ent non-success. Much skill in action will also be required. The Catholic Church is\r\n    governed by the first ray as its soul ray, and by the third ray as its personality ray.\r\n    Hence its love of politics and of temporal power; hence also its intensely commercial and\r\n    financial preoccupations. The mental ray of this Church is sixth ray. Hence its narrow\r\n    one-pointedness: [507] its emotional body is also sixth ray in quality, whilst the\r\n    physical ray of the outer Organization is seventh. These are points which should interest\r\n    you and which you need to bear in mind as you work.

He turned seven years old and following a good rule, we allowed only one child per year of age, so it was a small and intimate affair. Knowing that Waldorf teachers do not make a large salary, and as we are fortunate to have Zachary's birthday in the summer, Iasked our local teacher to \"work\" at his party and gave her a donation of $40.00 for 2 hours to \"supervise the children\". Want to Adopt? Pregnant? Free Services click here Ididn't purchase any \"party favors\" but instead chose to make our own with Zachary's help. We sought out polished stones, shells and healthy naturally sweet treats (carob raisins & nuts and granola bars from the local health food store). We sewed beanbags with ribbon streamers coming off one end. We carefully wrapped the polished stones along with some glass pebbles in colorful tissue and ribbons. We also found a lovely sticker store and found delightful fairy stickers. Instead of store bought goodie bags we went to our local craft shop and purchased simple bags made from recycled paper. We cut 2 holes into the front and weaved a ribbon through which we then tied. Also, across the front of the bag we pulled out our rubber stamps and placed a lovely border across the front, along the bottom of each bag. We also tried to remember how we \"do\" goodie bags at our home... well, Zachary remembered that we don't give them to each child as they come in, instead we wait until the very end. This is so that the children have something to take home and keep, and they are not consuming too much sugary sweets in such a short time! Guests arrived at 2:00. Miss Michele (the teacher) had several games planned for the children. They were all drawn to her sweet singing voice as she began to sing a circle song. They played several circle and movement games which kept them very active and moving for about 30 minutes. After that she rang her little hand held bell and announced that there would be a story under the tree at the far corner of our lawn. Meanwhile, Iset up the cake, candles, and matches on a small table. Iplaced 2 chairs by the table and our long (3 yard) rainbow silk running from the 2 chairs, like a red carpet, down a walkway. Iplaced flowerpots at the ends to hold it into place and Iasked all of the parents to help by placing themselves and their children into a circle around the silk. Ipassed out small cupcakes each with a small beeswax candle in it to all of the children. Iexplained to all of the children that the way we do birthdays is that we each get to have the candle on our cupcakes lit and we each get to make a wish for Zachary, so Miss Michele walked from child to child, lighting the candle and asking each child what they wished for Zachary. \"Iwish you to get lots of presents\", \"Iwish for you to play with me everyday\", \"Iwish for you to be happy\" were some of the wishes. Each child delighted in that they had the opportunity to blow out a candle and make a wish (and an important lesson is that they made the wish for someone other than themselves!) After that, Miss Michele told the wonderful story of Zachary's Rainbow Bridge As she told the story, all of the children (and parents) were in awe of Zachary. He sat tall and proud, after all, this is a celebration of the day of his birth! As she spoke of him coming over the rainbow bridge, he stood up, walked proudly to us and then sat with us. He was so pleased, he was squeezing my hand very hard because it had such a \"ceremonial\" feel to it. She then went on with the story and for each year of Zachary's life with us, she lit a candle. When all of the candles were lit, she carried the cake to Zachary who made a wish and blew out the candles. We all sang \"Happy Birthday to You\" and the every one went off to eat cake, cupcakes, and play. Ihad written on the invitations that it was a \"picnic style party\" and asked everyone to bring their favorite blanket or lawn chair to sit on. It was very comfortable and calm, outside under the trees with the cool summer breeze blowing. Miss Michele took the children on a nature walk through the Bamboo jungle (we lived on an 8 acre Bamboo Nursery at the time) and the children loved it. Meanwhile, Idid a quick clean up and set out a place for the opening of gifts. Now maybe Ijust have a personal peeve here, but Ihave noticed that at each and every party we have ever been to, the gifts get piled high, the cards and tags fall off, and the child rips through from one gift to the next. Ihave always tried to teach that a person puts much time, care and love into choosing a gift, and that needs to be acknowledged. So, for that reason, at our house, the gift giving is done a bit differently... Each child (and parent) holds onto their gift. When it is nearing the end of the party, we sit in a huge circle and Iask that everyone please be patient as Zachary opens the gifts. This may sound kind of tedious for many, but the actual experience is a great \"lesson\" for all of us home and un schoolers. Also, as each child carries and presents his gift, Zachary gives them the goodie bag. It's nice because each child gets to open a gift, plus they don't lose it during the 2 hours of the party... it goes home intact! I've taught Zachary to thank each person by looking into their eye and either offering them a hug or a hand shake and Itruly believe that giving and receiving go completely hand in hand and lend themselves to the \"breathing in-breathing out\" rhythm. Iam pleased to say that it went very well. Of course, we will now spend the next few days preparing lovely Thank you notes, and at our house... doing that is almost as much fun!

{"file_number": "98", "plaintext": [{"tag": "div", "text": "Executive Director Interview: Murry Shohat of the Embedded Linux Consortium"}, {"tag": "div", "text": "(Apr. 21, 2004) Foreword -- This interview with Murry Shohat, executive director of the Embedded Linux Consortium (ELC), discusses the work the ELC is doing to promote and standardize embedded Linux. It also discusses embedded Linux marketplace matters, technology, and standards organizations. This is the fifth in our series of interviews with executives at key embedded Linux companies and organizations (see \"Related Stories\" section below for a complete list). Q1: Can you provide a brief overview of the Embedded Linux Consortium (ELC): when was it formed, by whom, what has it accomplished, and what is it working towards? A1: The ELC began in 1999 as a brainstorm in the mind of Rick Lehrbaum, who was in touch with the early embedded Linux leaders as he constructed his now-venerable website, LinuxDevices.com. Rick brought me in early and we worked together to build the structure based on our complementary but separate consortium experiences in the embedded market. Aproposal was presented to an assembly of more than 75 invited corporate and open source leaders at the Spring Embedded Systems Conference in Chicago in March 2000. The ELC was officially born at that meeting, and Igained the job of Executive Director, tasked to fulfill a charter that was also refined and approved at the meeting. Within 120 days, ELC membership swelled to 120 members, most of them corporations ranging from startups to world giants. Our launch charter was to promote embedded Linux and open source software in order to gain traction in the embedded market and further the idea that Linux would provide an effective, secure, and powerful operating system. In those days, our board of directors (called the Formation Committee at the time) consisted of 19 corporations and open source individuals. After a year, we gained some sanity (for me, at least) and changed to a democratic seven-person board achieved through nomination and election. One of our directors is drawn from individual open source developer-members. Some of these members earn free membership through their prior contributions to the Linux code base. Getting the word out proved to be an effective mission. The ELC accomplished this by exhibiting at trade shows large and small, by proactive media relations where we talked about implementations, tools, startups etc., and by the work of our education committee where we provided speakers for conference programs, colloquia, and controversial panels. In the first 18 months, we were extremely busy. These activities continue today. Ahigh point for us was \"Pavilion 101\" at the 2002 Embedded Systems Conference (ESC) in San Francisco. At 120 feet in length, our Pavilion gathered many exhibiting members into a single thematic exhibit space that included a presentation theater. The Pavilion broke ESC's record for booth length. You could not attend the show and miss us and that was a big message to our proprietary competitors. But the real high point at this event was the standards kickoff meeting we held, which attracted a standing room only crowd plus strong media attendance and resulted in an earnest start for construction of what is now called the ELCPS, or Embedded Linux Consortium Platform Specification. The ELCPS has had in interesting history. In April 2001, the ELC board floated and promoted a proposal to add standards to our mission. Over the next year, the ELC sought and received a great deal of input, culminating in the standards kickoff at ESC2002. Attendees may recall the admonitions of Maddog Hall to remain pure and true to open source principles. From some quarters, the ELC was criticized for moving too fast. From other quarters, we took heat for moving too slow. In hindsight, my opinion is that we should have included standards activities in our original charter. The ELC board wanted to assemble a platform that offered assurance on the availability of a minimum set of resources that were needed by application software and middleware for any embedded Linux distribution. We listened to Maddog and others in this endeavor. It's important to note that the ELC does not distribute Linux code under our by laws. (Instead, our standards activity looks upon Linux distributions in a transparent fashion applicable to any Linux distribution.) The resulting ELCPS -- which took a year of intense work to build and ratify -- provides a unified open platform for embedded operating systems. As such, it helps developers by substantially decreasing the time and expense needed to construct embedded applications. The ELCPS provides a standard for the API layer that increases the reusability or portability of program code from project to project. The spec can be downloaded from Embedded-Linux.org . It offers resource guidance for applications ranging from small to large in terms of compute footprint. Today, the ELC continues its promotion activities and is seeking industry partners for the ELCPS. Notably, we are talking with the traffic control industry where the ELCPS could be adopted as a recommended development platform, and with various elements of Government and DoD (Department of Defense), where the ELCPS could help to maximize the benefits of using embedded Linux across DoD programs. Other market spaces are under discussion, but it's too early to say anything. Q2. Can you comment on the relative roles of the ELC and the Consumer Electronics Linux Forum (CELF)? A2: First and foremost, the ELC applauds the founders of CELF for their vision and energy, which are directed toward validation of Linux as the preferred operating system for consumer electronics. The CELF effort, like the ELC effort, underscores the desire of product developers to NOT be enslaved by any proprietary operating system. Both of our groups agree with and promote the principles and practices of open source software development. The core differentiation is that the ELC does not implement nor distribute Linux, while the CELF is actively constructing and distributing Linux via a source tree that is very specific to consumer electronic devices. Companies that wish to build CE devices that include Linux are motivated to provide engineers to develop the source tree for everyone's benefit. This is exciting and often intensely competitive among the contributing open source developers, but the result is expected to be a robust ecosystem of open source code in this important market space where an increasing number of new products are embedded computers. Historically, a lesson learned from the TRON operating system was rampant fragmentation that prevented the development of interoperable applications for essentially Japanese-developed CE devices. Ivisited with a number of Japanese executives at a Tokyo embedded technology trade show a few years ago and learned first hand about concerns with TRON. CELF in my view may reduce fragmentation in the embedded operating system market, and this will be good for everyone. At some point -- hopefully sooner rather than later -- value-added after-market applications developed to run, for example, on a Panasonic home theater system will also work on a competing Mitsubishi or Philips system. Thanks to Linux! While CE is a huge global market, it is just one market among many, and others such as telematics, mission critical military, traffic control, and medical instrumentation to name a few, have different needs. The resulting CELF source tree won't necessarily serve these requirements. The ELC hopes that the ELCPS can serve these broader needs by easing application development at the API level. Then, any Linux distribution that complies with the ELCPS can serve the specific needs of these various market spaces.  We also hope the ELCPS can serve as a tool for application and middleware software developers to provide a well-known and well-defined target API across distributions packaged by multiple different distributors. It's clear to ELC management, Ithink, that some market spaces may need custom-developed Linux distributions. Agood example predating CELF is carrier-grade Linux, sponsored by OSDL. The ELC encourages CELF, OSDL and others to keep their work consistent and compliant with the tenets of open source software development, notably keeping pace with official Linux kernel distributions as they continue their evolution. The ELC and CELF continue to have informal discussions about possible areas of cooperation. Q3: How would you characterize the current state of embedded Linux, as a market and as a technology? A3: Icharacterize the state as Hip Hip Hurray! Linux as an embedded OS has passed through infancy and adolescence in a real hurry, and is now delivering huge value for nearly all embedded applications. The native maturity of Linux under its program of development and distribution by Linus Torvalds and Andrew Morton has reached a point in the 2.6 kernel where embedded developers no longer need to consider home-brew as the most viable solution. Sure, engineering development is needed to handle niche-specific needs, but the core OS now has ample hooks, drivers, and resources to be a viable embedded platform nearly anywhere. Even the most demanding hard real-time applications can benefit. One of the ELC's members, LynuxWorks, is already offering 2.6 in the latest distribution of BlueCat Linux. Q4: What challenges do embedded Linux OS, tools, and services vendors face? A4: Ithink the key challenge is education to defeat FUD and more education to unify the landscape so that product developers gain confidence in Linux and open source. Distribution, tools, and services vendors must remain vigilant to stay ahead of FUD, and ELC membership is a good way to do that. On the tools front, there needs to be general recognition that open source compatibility is the Holy Grail, not Linux tool chains per se . Much attention has been focused on Linux-specific tool chains. In my opinion, the attention is misdirected. While tools need to offer cross-development and native development environments, the focus should be on access to the source code. Then, environments like Eclipse will become more attractive. Organizations familiar with Eclipse for development of a non-Linux application will be able to leverage their knowledge and build Linux applications. Different companies can offer powerful vendor-specific tool chains while also offering tool interoperability that benefits the customer. Through source code access, product developers have the best opportunity to achieve highly differentiated and competitive products, regardless of the tool chain. This is much different that the lock-in developers faced in the past, and it opens a new era for the development of tools. As in any market, if there are customers there will soon be products. Ithink this is an excellent time to be in the tools business where Linux developments are the target. By the way, my introduction to Linux came in the tools market for electronic design automation. Roll-your-own tools running on top of Linux back in 1997 were my heads-up as a journalist (it was this experience that put a star by my name on Rick Lehrbaum's Rolodex, leading to the launch of the ELC). The nature of open source made this scenario possible and I'm sure glad Rick called me. Q5: What market opportunities do you see for Linux in the embedded devices and systems market? A5: My personal view is that more and more of the products we encounter in life are becoming embedded computers. What a huge opportunity! When you study the moves of the titans in this business, it's clear that the embedded opportunity also connects with both enterprise and desktop computing and this is beyond exciting. This means that the era of \"pervasive\" computing is upon us, and the Linux OS represents a standardized platform for securely sharing information at home, at work, basically everywhere. It also means broad interoperability for application software and middleware, which will ultimately increase the ease and reduce the cost of computing to everyone. Open source software is rather unique in the manner in which it promises to help computing achieve its destiny as a key and ongoing technological enhancement for everyone's life. This is why we hear open source and embedded-friendly strategies coming from companies like SAP, Oracle, IBM, Sun, HP, and many others. These companies get it. As an example, buttonhole one of the titans and mention \"voice recognition.\" Leading companies -- those who are able to pay for targeted market research -- know that at some near-future point, they need their technology to be resident as middleware in your lap or on your plasma display and DVR in the family room. They need to enable recognition of your transaction-enabled voice from the microphone embedded in your DVR in order to achieve trustworthy and secure authorization and billing for the digital media stream you just requested while sitting on your sofa. These companies also want to have their software resident in medical instrumentation (web connected to a vast medical resource), in military ground support equipment, in traffic control -- not just traffic signals but in regional mass transit control, in tele/data communications, in factory automation, in just about any market you can mention where computers are being embedded. This of course trends to a long-term view. The near term opportunity is most visible right now in consumer electronics, so you can understand the rush to unify and defragment now taking place in CE. The titans of CE don't want to become a \"suburb of Redmond\" with all the taxation that implies, and their steps are instructive and illuminating for the entire embedded market. Let's hope they avoid mis-steps as they adopt Linux into one of the thinnest margin marketplaces on earth. Ihave always characterized the overall embedded market as a coalition of valleys, canyons, fjords, plains, and vales. On the hardware front, we see the distinctions in many competing form factors, like VME vs. CompactPCI, PC/104 vs. roll-your-own. And now, there are competing high performance serial fabrics -- data highways -- thrown in for forward migration. On the software front, we see proprietary operating systems competing head to head with Linux. My background spans more than 30 years in these markets, and Iunderstand fully the pressures faced by system integrators who attempt to unite standard and custom hardware with too many flavors of operating systems. Enter Linux into these spaces as a single unified platform. If it can handle the custom needs of the canyons and fjords, and if it can offer ROI to the integrators who solve specific embedded computing problems with their combinations of hard- and software, then Linux stands a good chance to become the market share leader. This is why Iwasn't surprised by Wind River's shift toward Linux support. Or Green Hills recent FUD attack against Linux. Q6: What challenges does embedded Linux face as a technology? A6: The key long-term challenge is in the business model, in my opinion -- how to make money with Linux. The short-term challenge is to define real-time. My takeaway from the recent Embedded Systems Conference, where Italked with perhaps 100 developers who stopped by the ELC booth -- is that \"real-time\" needs to be defined and applied to Linux in order to end confusion over the operating system's capabilities. When questioned by experienced Linux developers, it turns out that much of the confusion -- certainly more than half -- can be categorized in the soft real-time domain, which the current 2.6 distributions handle quite well. ELC members like MontaVista, LynuxWorks, and FSM Labs, among others, address the balance of concern --millisecond and microsecond hard real-time. The ELC needs to do a better job with real-time definitions, and Iam pushing this at the board level as something we can do for the benefit of the overall market. Then we can engage in the development of real-time API's as an expansion of the ELCPS. The long-term challenge -- extracting ROI and profit -- is a function of the free market, in my opinion. Linux is challenged more by its business model than its technology model. The GPL is at the heart of this discussion, and the ELC is motivated to provide GPL education in the open marketplace of ideas. We mounted panel sessions on the topic at this year's CES show, and recently we agreed to do it again. Iam now looking for venues where we can bring together leaders who can help audiences learn how to extract profits from open source software. The question of making money on Linux, of course, transcends markets. The GPL is at the center of issues in enterprise and desktop Linux, where groups like OSDL, FSF, LI, LPI, and FSG also engage in open marketplace education. My take is that making a profit is not market specific. What works for enterprise will likely work for embedded. Groups like the ELC can and should play an educational role. Q7: What embedded Linux technology developments do you find exciting? A7: Please allow me two answers, short term and long term. I'm a tech junkie always looking for near term gratification. So the consumer space has my attention. Iwant my wireless Centrino laptop to gather media streams -- for example from my Internet connection, my digital camera, camcorder, and mp3 player, and deliver them to TV's and stereos anywhere in my home. When family and guests gather for a holiday celebration, Iwant to show photos and videos on the family room TV with complete ease (freedom from the need to connect cables, change resolutions, struggle with blank screens or no sound, etc.). When my wife requests that Ivisit the Internet to gather recipes for Baked Ziti, Ino longer want to simply print out some pages for her consideration. Instead, Iwant her to be able to watch a digital video of Baked Ziti preparation, from the Food Channel or some other stream source, on demand, at the point of need, namely the kitchen. If my grandchildren or even my dog has an illness, I'd like to be able to effortlessly and transparently gain the collective wisdom of others by using the same resources. It's just not that hard anymore to build custom real-time teleconferences with exiting hardware and software in the hands of non-specialists (like our family doctor or vet). And, I'd like to be able to vote in our local, regional, and national elections this same way. All of these developments are taking place now, with many more examples of functionality that will benefit all of us in the near term. Mid-term, I'm aware of interesting developments that promise to improve our lives in even more important ways. For example, sensors attached to an embedded computer that enjoys Internet connectivity can help us cut down doctor and hospital visits. With inexpensive instrumentation that we either own or rent, diagnosis can be achieved without leaving home. It's a new form of real-time house call that will be welcomed everywhere. One side note of importance. Isee more upside for Linux in health care than in most other markets. This is because most of the technological investment in health care focuses on drugs and procedures, not on information technology. There is just a huge opportunity out there for pervasive health care solutions based on open source and Linux. On the automotive front, our developed economies also have the highest reliance on fossil fuels. Embedded and open source software technology is likely to help out more than most people realize. For example, we are quickly entering the period of hybrid vehicles that rely on embedded computers for their efficiency. Linux is playing an important role in these developments. By this time next year, nearly every major automaker will offer one or more hybrids. Around 30 models are in the pipeline. Obviously, OS competitors for this kind of application must demonstrate qualities such as reliability and real-time performance. Linux is well suited, and its low total cost of ownership is likely to win this market and others like it. Open source software and Linux can also play an important long term unifying role in Government. My resume includes several years in aerospace, where Ilearned that Government and DoD applications mirror the broader market for all kinds of computers. It sure makes sense to me to promote the ELCPS as a commercial, off-the-shelf unifying platform in this market, contrasted with far too many proprietary solutions that cost taxpayers far too much and by definition rule out interoperability and reusable software. The ELCPS enables program managers to rule things in, not out. Q8: Can you share one or two of your organization's most exciting successes? A8: Our most exciting success came at the start, when companies around the globe rallied to join and support our mission. It was a clear and eloquent signal. The era of proprietary operating systems controlling our development destiny had drawn to an end. We could see the source code, and as a result our future based on open source gets brighter every day. Q9: How about a failure? A9: Speaking organizationally, I'm annoyed by the way in which many trade associations lost members during the economic downturn we've experienced over the last 3 years, exacerbated as it was by world terrorism. As robust as the ELC was at launch and for our first two years, we now find ourselves rebuilding. There's a lot of road kill out there -- companies who were too weak or poorly financed to survive. But there are a lot of survivors and new starts. We need to get these companies back into membership to get more shoulders behind our missions. Ialso think that the overall open source industry has failed to fully communicate the values of open source software. This has become an opportunity to create a virtual \"Redmond\" for open source software. The world of commerce is used to single point news and information sources. Detroit says \"this,\" Redmond says \"that,\" Washington disagrees, Paris argues, Tokyo waffles. Linux has no political Detroit, Redmond, Washington, Paris or Tokyo. Open source advocates are mostly reactive to news events and FUD, rather than proactive. I'm annoyed by the way in which FUD gains traction in headlines due to the marketing machine owned by a single, deep pocket. Iam hopeful that groups like the ELC can shift gears to become proactive as legitimate representatives of constituencies whose collective voice represents equal value. Then we can prevent FUD, rather than spend our valuable time defending against it. Q10: What's your vision of the future for embedded Linux? That is, how big will the embedded Linux market get, and when will it start to reach that peak? A10: My own opinion is that we have entered the super exponential phase -- we are at the tipping point in 2004 in all embedded markets. While I'm not equipped to provide estimates with dollar signs, Enterprise Linux already enjoys double-digital share of the deployed market. Ifeel confident that embedded Linux will achieve double-digit actual share of the deployed market by the end of 2004. Desktop will achieve double-digit in 2005 or 6. By 2010, embedded Linux will enjoy 50 percent or more market share and Linux in general will have global mind share in the same range. I'll also stick my neck out and predict that the world's largest software applications company will begin porting to Linux within two years. Q11: How do you see the 2.6 kernel affecting the embedded Linux market? A11: Answered above. 2.6 is the best thing to happen for embedded because it brings popular economies of scale as well as embedded-centric features and thus decreases the development cost of embedded apps that use popular technologies like USB. Q12: Any comments on the SCO mess? A12: You may be sorry you asked. These are my personal views, not ELC views. Ihave always considered SCO \"theatre of the absurd.\" And Groklaw.net is the venue or stage where the best actors play. Sure, there are respected folks who say that real legal matters are being contested. My view is that our treasured way of life is what makes an SCO (or a Green Hills) possible, so let it play out, enjoy it, and learn from it. The system is working even if you get so mad you'd like to toss a figurative punch or two. In the mid-run, open source and Linux will win. We have dysfunctional families, why not dysfunctional companies as well? My experience says that much of what we see and hear begins as \"personal\" to someone -- an issue of pride or hurt feelings or arrogance. Individuals and groups like SCO or Green Hills have difficulty getting above their own psychology to look at the bigger picture. They are clouded and conflicted by their feelings, and via PR firms and legal teams willing to accept their money (and equally greedy investors willing to give them money), they rationalize that a jury will agree with them, or the media will promote their agenda. Now to my real view. Istated it earlier in a different form when Iclaimed that there is no \"Redmond\" in open source. Well, SCO has provided a temporary solution. There is no way that any organization -- ELC or otherwise -- could gain as much positive press for open source software in general and Linux in particular as SCO has done. Yeah, Iknow, positive press for Linux is hardly the intention of SCO. But, positive press is what SCO has achieved, the FUD notwithstanding any earnest examination. Whatever the source of SCO's funding, the open source community could not have purchased better PR at any price. Why is this? Because of the absurd, that's why. By coming at the open source community as they have, SCO has increased the dynamic range of the volume of the competing messages. In usual situations -- when reason governs argument -- we hear both sides at the same relative decibel level. But SCO has placed unreasonable arguments on the table, getting our attention in the process. They have made our \"hearing\" super sensitive. Now, when the open source community offers a robust defense, everyone is tuned in because unreasonable (actually, outrageous) arguments got our attention in the first place. By being unreasonable, SCO has made sure we all have a dog in this fight. And we are cheering for our dog. In the end, Ithink we'll all grudgingly thank SCO for actually accelerating the acceptance of Linux and open source software by giving it such a wonderful theater to display its clear virtues. There are other legal issues with more impact on open source and Linux. If the open source community wants to pay attention to a real case with real potential impact, take a look at InterTrust. By now, I'm sure you have heard of it. This case deals with digital content piracy. Microsoft just settled with InterTrust by paying $440 million. Titans in consumer electronics own InterTrust and they have a digital rights management patent portfolio dating back more than a decade. As Linux wins designs in consumer electronics, InterTrust stands to reap rewards through IP licensing. Ihave no doubt that InterTrust will be in the news (and in the pockets of those who plan on distributing digital content) long after SCO fades. Q13: What do you think about Wind River's recent steps into the embedded Linux market? A13: Ithink the industry perspective is to celebrate Wind River's new strategy. It clearly benefits everyone to have the engineering prowess of companies like Wind River behind open source software. And, of course, the ELC would welcome them back as a member. Wind River was on our original Formation Committee.

The free software movement is quick to cite service contracts as the\nbest way to make money from selling free software.  There is a problem\nwith that. Companies are quicker to spend money on service contracts for\nproprietary software. The typical Linux software using company will have service contracts\non its Sun workstations including the software, and a hardware only\nservice contract on its Linux workstatons.  It will have service\ncontracts on Network Appliance fileservers, and, well, there is\nexactly one company (Lycos-Europe) with a large service contract on\nits ReiserFS fileservers. If a Linux using company does have service contracts on its Linux\nworkstations/appliances, most of the time that money goes to some\nintermediary company which doesn't give any of the money to the\nauthors of the software being serviced. This is not rational economic behavior.  The authors of the software\nwill indeed give much more expert advice than anyone else.  They will\nprobably give it cheaper also.  It makes no economic sense whatsoever\nto be slower to buy a service contract on free software than on\nproprietary software if you use the free software. It is very real behavior though, and it is killing off many free\nsoftware companies.  Sourceforge went proprietary because their sales\npeople couldn't sell service contracts for free software, and making\nthe premiere version of the software proprietary made the service\ncontract an easier sale.  GFS, Bitkeeper, how many pieces of software\nmight have been free if the service revenues had been there? This is deeply endangering the free software industry's fiscal\nviability. Why are they reluctant to pay for service on something that is free? Iget several emails a day from users who want me to tell them\nsomething in our FAQ, or to diagnose that they didn't really recompile\nthe kernel module like they thought they did, etc.  Iam happy to do\nthis, but Ithink Ishould get paid for it quite honestly. We have a support page which has to have the lowest fee in the\nindustry, $25 a question, and we'll answer any Linux related question\n(though most of the ones we get are ReiserFS related quite naturally.)\nThis support webpage gets used once every several days. Irefer the emailers with user error problems to the support page.\n(Bug reports not in the FAQ we handle for free, though the proprietary\nguys laugh and tell me that they charge for bug reports also.)  Maybe\n40% of those emailers with user errors send me a flame back, angry\nthat Iwant money to answer a simple question that Iknow the answer\nto.  They wouldn't send an email like this to their medical doctor\nexpecting a free diagnosis. So we have a real problem in our industry.  Economically irrational\nbehavior by users is killing our industry's revenues, and it\ndemolished the business plans that all of those Linux VCs funded once\nand swore to never fund another one looking like it again. Where do we go from here? The advantage that Gnu/Linux has is passion.  We need some focused\npassion.  If it is not logical, then we need to get going with the\npsychological!  If you believe in the value of the free software\nmovement, then you need go to the next IT purchases meeting at your\ncompany or government lab, and ask if there is a service contract from\nthe developers on all of the significantly used free software.  It is\nthat simple. We need to create a cultural norm in which it is considered proper\nbehavior to buy service from free software authors with the same\nfrequency one buys it from proprietary software authors.  The way to\ndo it is to acknowledge we have a problem, and start telling people\nbeing irrational doesn't just leave you losing the cost of your time,\nit leaves you hurting a movement you care about. There are other ways also, but Idon't find them as attractive. My guess is that most of the reason the proprietary vendors sell more\nservice contracts is that users are more inclined to buy service when\nit is one more line on a contract than when it is a new contract. An economist might be tempted to call this a transaction cost, and\nthink rational behavior is occurring, but beware that temptation!\nThis marketing phenomenom holds true even for customers where the cost\nof service would be hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Rational\neconomic behavior for the customer company as a whole it is not. We could for instance modify the license to require users to\npurchase zero or more dollars worth of service from the software\nauthors (including issuing a purchase order or supply a credit card\neven if the order is for zero dollars).  Ithink that some of those\nvendors whose free software business plan seriously depends on service\nrevenue should consider experimenting with this.  Alternatively, we\nshould just not depend on service revenue for the support of free\nsoftware businesses. Perhaps one can better make substantial amounts of money from\nservice if one's product is complicated enough.  MySQL seems to be\nmaking that approach work.  Namesys plans to add database and\nhypertext functionality to ReiserFS.  It is possible that someday our\nfilesystem will offer sufficient functionality that having a Namesys\nconsultant will be worthwhile for the average fortune 500 company.  In\nthat case the whole revenue model could snowball, with each consultant\ncreating more features, each new feature creating more customers, and\nthe end result could eventually be a company the size of Anderson\nconsulting advising companies on their information bases.  While there\nis nothing unique to open source about this, it is possible that open\nsource could allow a faster initial user adoption rate. It is interesting that free software service revenue at this time\nseems to encourage economic concentration.  This is not very\nencouraging if it holds true for the long term, and we end up with\nproprietary software locking out competitors from the source code, and\nfree software vendors either not giving any of the revenue to\ndevelopers (most small vendors) or being highly concentrated large\nvendors who favor funding software internally developed and\ncontrolled.  The only thing worse than a state controlled economy is a\nmonopoly controlled economy. Keep in mind that this is being written from a perspective in the\ndepths of the 2001 tech bust in which Namesys is managing \"only\" a\n100% annual growth rate due to the severity of the economy.  While\nReiserFS usage is increasing by one or two orders of magnitude, all\nnon-governmental sources that were on the verge of increasing revenue\nby an order of magnitude disappeared as those customers entered into\nlayoffs."}, {"tag": "h1", "text": "Free software is very effective as a market sampling methodology."}, {"tag": "p", "text": "That does imply though that one must segment one's market.  One way to\nsegment the market is according to whether the software is integrated\nwith proprietary software.  Our licensing policy says that if you\nmake money from charging for usage licenses, then we must make money\ntoo.  This allows Namesys to sell to fileserver vendors and\nproprietary software vendors who want to add proprietary improvements\nto ReiserFS.  All sales that Namesys has made in this area have\nresulted from market sampling being very effective.  It generates far\nmore revenue at this time than service does. Sales to proprietary OS vendors have not happened yet, but once the\neconomy recovers this could change, and interest has been expressed.\nIt takes just one sale of that size to make 8 years of work on a high\nrisk technological gamble pay off financially."}, {"tag": "h1", "text": "Open Sales"}, {"tag": "p", "text": "We could make proprietary optional plugins, with the core filesystem\nremaining GPL'd.  An issue though is how to prevent the poor from\nbeing locked out of access to software.  Software fees are usually set\nto what an average middle-aged man spending his boss's money at a US\ncorporation would be willing to pay.  Currently the only reasonable\noption for the poor for most software is to pirate their software.\n(Pirating can also serve as a form of anti-trust vigilante action when\nthe judicial system is as corrupted as it is in the US.)  Making\nlicense fees proportional to storage hardware cost is the best way to\nhandle this. This still leaves us with the economic inefficiency that occurs when a\nuser needs a spreadsheet three times a year, and he would like to use\nthe best one made, but the best one is priced appropriately for those\nwho use it several times a week.  Icall this the focused taxation\ninefficiency. Most products are sold for more than their marginal cost because most\nreal markets are only semi-competitive.  Doing this distorts the\neconomy.  Software takes this distortion to its greatest extreme, and\nbest illuminates a longstanding inefficiency in real world semi-free\nmarket economics. Ihave an unproven hypothesis to put before you: The amount of\neconomic distortion is a function of not just the total dollar amount\ntraded and exceeding the marginal cost, but is a function also of the\nratio of price to marginal cost, and high ratios are \"typically\" more\ndistorting than low ratios, even if the total number of dollars is\nmade equal.  Persons interested in discussing proving this hypothesis\nare encouraged to email me at reiser@namesys.com.  If the hypothesis\nis true, then can we choose to defocus the disincentive? Can we avoid the serious disadvantages of a state controlled, or\nmonopoly controlled, economy, and avoid the focused taxation\ninefficiency at the same time?  How can we lockout neither poor\ncustomers nor poor startup OS component suppliers? I'd like you to consider the concept of open sales.  In an open sale,\nusers pay a fixed percentage of hardware costs as a fee for using a\nsoftware pool.  Users may use all software in the pool.  The users are\npresented with a random sample of those developers who contributed to\nthe pool, and asked to allocate their fee among the sample in\nproportion to their perceived utility. Benefits: Adefocused disincentive to use software.  You may use the best of\nanything in the pool. Poor people can afford the fee. More finegrained rewarding of developers in proportion to their\nproductivity than traditional copyright law due to reduced transaction\ncosts. More accurate rewarding due to assessment of value being made\nafter usage."}, {"tag": "h1", "text": "Conclusion"}]}

Doping rumors: New distraction or same old same old? Tyler Hamilton: You ride up d'Huez with a broken collarbone. Jan Ulrich: He has the team to beat Armstrong, but does he have the work ethic? Vino, Basso, Mayo.... Vinokourov is supposedly out of the Tour de France after a crash in the Tour of Switzerland. During a warm-up race for the Tour de France (Ibelieve it's called the Dauphine Libere), Mayo beat Lance by nearly 2 minutes in a mountain time trial, and Mayo went on to win the race.  His big question, is his team strong enough to carry Mayo for 3 weeks?  Can his team do well enough in the team time trial?  I've heard this year there was a rule change that limits the time loss in the team time trial to something like 2 and a half minutes. Tyler Hamilton came in 2nd in Dauphine Libere, including beating Lance up the mountain time trial (35 seconds back of Mayo).  He also won a 5 stage race in Switzerland earlier this year (Ibelieve it's called the Tour de Romandie). Ullrich did not have a great performance in the Tour of Germany, but if memory serves me right, he did win the Tour of Switzerland. Another challenger is Lance's former domestique...Roberto Heras.  Heras is riding for what used to be known as Team ONCE, and is expected to be the team leader.  There is absolutely no doubt that Heras can climb with the best of them.  His team is also fairly good, so Idoubt the team time trial will be a problem. Lance's coach says that the time trial up L'Alpe D'Huez is not the most important stage.  It's an important stage, but the most important.  Apparently the next day is going to be brutal.  Lance's coach says it could well be a 7 hour stage with several brutal climbs. Honestly, Ido wonder if Lance can win this year.  Ithink he's had more distractions this year than in years past...what with Sheryl Crowe hanging around all the time, all the commercial shoots, magazine cover shoots, getting a new primary sponsor, etc.  Iwonder if he's done enough training this year. My sincere hope:  2 Americans on the podium this year...Hamilton and Armstrong. jtwcornell91 06-29-2004, 09:15 AM Originally posted by Murray Speak English you unmitigated cheese eater.:p Shouldn't it be \"... du Tour de France\"?

Still, the three best teams this year should be Postal, Hamilton's Phonak team, and T-Mobile.  Phonak has looked really strong this pre-season, and they should contend for the team time trial stage.  The tour organizers put a 2min limit on the TTT loss for this years tour, so that will help riders like Mayo and Heras.  Heras also has another former USPS teammate on his roster, Christian Vande Velde, which will definitely help him in the smaller mountains and the TTT. The Dauphine results were a little skewed because Armstrong wanted to take it easier than the last few years (he won it in 02 and 03) because last year he crashed during one of the stages and was supposedly still in pain from that during the start of the Tour.  Apparently he got a time check during the Mont Ventoux TT and saw that Mayo and Hamilton were already flying, so he took it easier for the remainder of the climb.  The Alpe d'Huez TT in this years Tour is going to be amazing to watch, it will definitely be alot closer than the Dauphine TT.  It is probably the stage I'm most looking forward to seeing. The day after that, like nanookfan said, will be killer.  Long, with two or maybe three (Idon't remember) HC climbs ending with a mountain top finish on the HC climb Plateau d'Beille.  That has the possibility of being an epic stage, especially with the mountain TT the day before and some riders still spent from that. Ithink that this years Tour has the possibility of being one of the best in many years, and my guess is that the top four will be: Armstrong, Hamilton, Mayo, and Ullrich, in no particular order. :) brianvf 06-29-2004, 12:37 PM It was also disappointing to see that David Millar, one of the better TT today was banned from the Tour due to allegedly confessing to doping.  He, like Lance, has never tested positive, which raises questions about how he hid the doping from the drug testers, and if other riders are doing the same thing.

TTT: Yes, there is a 3 minute maximum loss in the TTT.  What Idon't know is whether there's a cutoff.  While Isuppose it wouldn't be sporting, a team that concedes 3 minutes in the TTT could effectively take the day off and go on a training ride if there were no absolute cutoff. 3.  It's disappointing to see Millar out, but as Iunderstand it, he both had EPO in his house and confessed to using it.  Ithink that's the difference between Millar and Armstrong at this point.  Armstrong's soigneur's allegations, however, are the strongest yet. 4.  Agree Brianvf's top four; agree the order is unknowable. dude 06-30-2004, 03:11 PM [QUOTE]Originally posted by MavRick [B] 2.

While Isuppose it wouldn't be sporting, a team that concedes 3 minutes in the TTT could effectively take the day off and go on a training ride if there were no absolute cutoff. An Anti-Lance rule that is for sure. Ithink everyone in the US would like to see Lance win again, but just remember that Lance says that he is usually an 8 out of 10 (for being in shape) when the tour starts - he likes to peak during the tour.  So folks, don't panic early on.  Also people are worried about the Sheryl Crow distraction and the ad shoots, etc.  Ibelieve that Lance is the most focused athlete of our time, cycling comes first. Ialso think that with all of the new drug allegations, he will be more motivated than ever.  GO LANCE!!! kbranch 07-02-2004, 11:25 AM For those interested, here is link to the rules for this year's tour. The TTT rankings can be found in \"Article 24\", starting on page 16. Official Rules (http://www.letour.fr/2004/docs/reglement_us.pdf) Here are the highlights for the TTT: The procedure for establishing the general individual time ranking is as follows: Times for all riders are calculated according to the gap between them and the 5th man of the winning team (scratch time). If this gap is less than that given in the table below, then the actual time recorded by the timekeepers will be taken. If the gap is more than that given in the table below, then the rider will receive the time of the winning team plus the additional number of seconds indicated in the table below according to the place of their team. 20 for the 2nd team 30 for the 3rd team 40 for the 4th team 50 for the 5th team 1 for the 6th team 110 for the 7th team 120 for the 8th team 130 for the 9th team 140 for the 10th team 150 for the 11th team 200 for the 12th team 210 for the 13th team 220 for the 14th team 230 for the 15th team 235 for the 16th team 240 for the 17th team 245 for the 18th team 250 for the 19th team 255 for the 20th team 300 for the 21st team Riders who arrive on their own after the 5th rider in their team will be credited for the general ranking with the actual time they took to complete the stage. However, riders finishing outside of the permitted finishing times (coefficient 6) will be disqualified. As far as the general team ranking is concerned, the actual time of the 5th man in each team will be the time recorded for this ranking. Coefficient 6 is described as the winning team time plus 25%. brianvf 07-02-2004, 11:44 AM Originally posted by dude An Anti-Lance rule that is for sure. Iagree.  Strange that this new TTT rule goes into effect the year that he is trying to win his 6th. :rolleyes: An interesting article on VeloNews.com was talking about how this would have changed last years overall if these new rules would have been in place: Amajor change this year is that there will be a limit on the time lost by any team (and consequently by each rider who arrives with the first man to finish in the team) in the team time trial. The riders on the winning team (except for those who are dropped by their team) will all have their actual finish time added to GC, but there will be a maximum loss of 20 seconds for the second team, 30 seconds for the third, then 10-second gaps to 13th place (a 2:20 maximum loss), and then five-second gaps down to 2:50 for the 21st (and last) team. In 2003, instead of the result being: 1. U.S. Postal 2. ONCE, at 0:30 3. Bianchi, at 0:43 It would have been: 1. U.S. Postal 2. ONCE, at 0:20 3. Bianchi, at 0:30. Also, 18th-placed Euskaltel-Euskadi, instead of losing 3:22, would have lost only 2:35. If the new system had been in place last year, Iban Mayo would have taken over the yellow jersey at L'Alpe d'Huez, not Lance Armstrong; and Alex Vinokourov would have displaced Armstrong as the race leader at Loudenvielle on stage 14. brianvf 07-02-2004, 03:44 PM Who does everyone think will win tomorrow's prologue and take over the yellow? McGee, Armstrong, Ullrich, Hamilton?? The course, being flat and very short (6 km), favors a strong, powerful rider such as Ullrich.  But maybe an unknown will surprise being that most of the favs will be hoping to peak in about three weeks instead of now. :) brianvf 07-02-2004, 09:23 PM Just watched \"Road to the Tour\" on OLN.  They showed coverage of a press conference with Lance from yesterday where he was fielding questions about the book allegations.  One of the writers, David Walsh, was in attendance, and Lance was staring him down hardcore during the questioning.  It was pretty sweet. :) nanookfan 07-02-2004, 10:18 PM I'm not sure Lance would want the yellow jersey this early in the tour.  He has said in the past it is hard to defend the yellow jersey, and defending it from the very start of the race is hard on the team. If Iremember correctly, Lance finished 7th in last year's Prologue, so Iwouldn't be too shocked if he wasn't in yellow after tomorrow. After watching \"The Lance Chronicles\" yesterday, and the OLN tour preview, it seems a lot of folks are thinking Lance is going to win this thing.  Imust confess, Idon't think he's going to, but during the episode of \"The Lance Chronicles\" that Isaw (when he was talking about the Dauphine Libre), he seemed confident even though Mayo beat him by 2 minutes in the time trial.  He said \"Two minutes is a lot\" but he had this goofy grin on his face as if to say \"Iknow something you don't know.\"  Could he have been sandbagging in the Dauphine? Interestingly enough, Phil Liggett, Paul Sherwen, and Bob Roll (the OLN commentating crew) all are predicting Lance to win the tour. Idon't know a lot about the sport, but I'll make a bold (all be it wild) guess at the Prologue result.  I'll guess Tyler Hamilton.  He's a good time trialer, and he's hungry.  Ithink a yellow jersey would mean the world to him.  Perhaps tomorrow will be his day. rufus 07-02-2004, 10:53 PM not knowing who all is riding for all the teams, i'll go with mcgee. vBulletin v3.6.0, Copyright ©2000-2006, Jelsoft Enterprises Ltd."}]}

It did distract from my marriage a bit, to be honest - a couple of nights Islept in the spare room, because the text alert kept going and Ithought, this is ridiculous. Idon't think it's morally OK, and I've pulled myself back from it, as otherwise it would be all-consuming. Inow think, my marriage is my marriage; this is something extracurricular. Ipersonally feel the ultimate connection is sex, and Iworry that if Idid, it would be disappointing and there would be nothing left - and Iwouldn't do that to my husband. But there's definitely something edgy and covert and beyond the realms of what's acceptable.\" After a certain age, an almost universal desire to settle down with the right person takes hold. Plato's image of lost souls storming about free-range until they slot together with their other halves remains powerful, even in an over-sexualised era where we obsess about adulterous celebrities. We still want to find The One. But, at the same time, The One may not be enough. We believe we shouldn't have to adhere to the constraints of our parents' putative lifelong mating. We want it all, and believe we're entitled to it all. We end up combining the best monogamous intentions with a whiff of rebellion against that very state. Pure monogamy is not quite in tune with our supposedly swinging, secular society. David Miller is the founder of Loving Links, an extra-marital dating service for \"thoughtful, attached men and women looking for romance\". \"Adults now don't want to grow up,\" he says. \"We're told that we should be having this, this and this, and we feel hard done by if we don't. It's also the case for the baby-boomer generation: we're all Peter Pans, and no one's yet sent us a letter saying we have to stop having fun and sex.\" There is a compulsion for the attached to seek romantic, if not fleshy, liaisons as a licensed way to have something on the side. Websites such as Friends Reunited involve a sizable chunk of the population in one big adult sleepover, texting and emailing anyone they like or fancy the sound of. This is justified as mental relief, a reward for juggling partners with long working hours and last-minute children. And for living so unprecedentedly long. Robin, an advertising executive who has been sexually faithful throughout his nine-year marriage, maintains ongoing romantic fantasies. \"Ithink guys do all the time,\" he says. \"There's this notion that women like romance and men like raw sex, and Ithink that's not necessarily the case. People talk about sex addiction, but Ithink sex addiction is a kind of romance addiction. It's part of male desire - not a priapic need, but a need to be validated and adored and made to feel whole by someone's reciprocal gaze. It's people who come into your life on a regular basis - you build up a little bit of a crush on them, and the next thing you know, you can't quite look them in the eye and you've got a fantasy about them. Igo to Pilates a couple of times a week, and there's got to be someone I've got a crush on at Pilates, someone my imagination lands on. In the class, in its wordlessness, there's something relatively intimate about it. There's a girl who's got a tattoo on her shoulder, she's got a good shape and is nice and probably in her mid-30s, and in another life Icould see myself with her. Ikind of identify with her. It's more a romantic thing than a lust thing, but with an element of lust. \"I'm very happy in my marriage, but if Idon't have somebody Ifeel romantically towards outside it, then Ifeel there's something wrong with my life. Isee it as perfectly reasonable, not a problem, because Ithink there's an absolute moral distinction between shagging someone else and having fantasies about someone else. It casts a spell on your boring daily life.\" Iwanted to write about slow-burning emotional infidelity in my new novel, because profound longing is more powerful than swiftly gratified lust. Afrisson of mutual recognition can develop into a fixation in which both parties are stroking each other's mind, an exchange charged with suppressed sexual desire. Close and frequent mental interaction can be intensely erotic. It is astonishing how quickly even the most monogamous can turn into tumescent fools, deleting messages, fantasising about torrid futures with people they barely know. The straitjacket of no-sex-allowed becomes an addiction in itself. \"Having a partner who's emotionally unfaithful is maybe more hurtful than one who's physically unfaithful,\" says Miller. Paula Hall, a relationships therapist at Relate, thinks of infidelity as a breach of trust. \"It's when you're sharing emotional stuff with other people that you should be sharing with your partner.\" According to a study last year by Dr Monica Whitty of Queen's University Belfast, online emotional involvement can have as much impact on an existing relationship as sexual infidelity. In her study of 234 participants, who evaluated hypothetical online situations, women were found to be more likely than men to view emotional infidelity as cheating, and also more likely to see online infidelity as harmful to a real-life relationship; however, others described the interaction as \"just a friendship\" and would not classify it as infidelity \"as there was no physical sex taking place\". The online interactions studied ranged from mild flirting to cybersex, and Whitty found that people's definitions of fidelity varied wildly. \"The new technology and opportunities for infidelity are evolving together. Cyberspace is a safe place to flirt. With online infidelity, people see a fuzzy boundary between reality and fantasy. Our social scripts about what is acceptable behaviour online are not as clear-cut as they are offline, and there's more opportunity for betrayal now that we've got more people to choose from online. People work less on their own relationship; they tend to look elsewhere. Increasing numbers of people are now going to therapy because of online betrayal. \"The results of this study show that couples need to be clear what the rules are when it comes to online cheating,\" says Whitty. \"Emotional involvement, even without physical consummation, can be just as damaging to a relationship.\" Hall agrees: \"Generally, research says that there is more personal disclosure online than in a face-to-face situation.\" One woman Iknow in her 20s regularly emails strangers, going out on drinking dates as a relief from the stresses of her relationship. Many of her friends take a similar approach to their romantic lives. We may be approaching an era in which heated romantic or sexual online relationships will be deemed acceptable, just as men have traditionally used porn while some partners turn a blind eye. The repressed British psyche is well suited to a form of communication at once intimate and detached. In news reports of the misadventures of David Beckham, the provocative texts he sent Rebecca Loos were given greater prominence than details of any alleged sex, the most secret flirtation unravelling in all its ungrammatical glory. Cate, a lecturer who has lived with her girlfriend for four years, recently emerged from an obsessive but non-physical relationship with another woman. \"What was so dangerous,\" she says, \"is that we seemed to have an incredible meeting of minds. The more tangly and intricate the conversations we had, the more it seemed that we had to keep having them, that no one else thought like this. It's only now Irealise that, because it was almost all through letters, emails and phone calls, Icould ignore the fact that Ididn't even physically fancy her, though I'd persuaded myself Idid. It could remain an affair that was about to happen, which was incredibly exciting. \"I'd sit at my desk rigid with anticipation for the bing of my email; there was nothing like the thrill of an enormous, involved email from her. It was like a speeded-up 18th-century romance - we were courting while pretending not to, and the speed made it all more exciting and feverish. Because it almost all took place at my desk, it was very easy to pigeonhole: it was a marvellous, stimulating life of the mind with nothing to do with either the sex or the arguments Iwas having with my girlfriend. Ididn't really feel guilty: it felt like this discovery of a soulmate that should be encouraged, and nothing to worry my girlfriend about. Even as it got more romantic - and it went on for nearly two years; it consumed me - there was a safety belt: nothing had actually happened.\" More partnerships are now formed through the workplace than through social life. Most adults spend more waking hours with colleagues than with their partners, making meaningful, exciting and even intimate workplace interactions inevitable. The mind is a sex organ, especially for women, a fact that is overlooked in a body-fixated and anti-intellectual era. In the workplace and by email, inventive brains thrive. Hall says this transformation of the workplace into one big touchy-feely melting pot of sensibilities has significant consequences at home. \"In terms of work, we all talk more openly: it's horribly American, but we're getting more and more into 'sharing' ourselves. The ethos of the workplace has changed a lot, too - there's more emphasis on self-awareness, on emotional intelligence and literacy, on teamwork, all things that are about building a community in the workplace. Increasingly, it's the right place to share more personal stuff. And then it can get dangerous.\" The office can be a sexy place. Carey, an events organiser, has been in a relationship for eight years but has formed a strong emotional relationship with someone at work. Her friends are similarly distracted. \"I've got a small group of friends. We've known each other for ever and we're all married or with someone. In the past few years, we've begun talking in a really excited, conspiratorial way about who we've got a thing for on the side. It reminds me of when we were in our early 20s. We've got children, we're older, but there's this wonderful excitement at having a mental crush, a fascination, a thing going on with someone you hope won't lead to anything. It's boring talking about your marriage, and somehow too revealing - you can't talk about married sex because it's too intimate. We talk about other people instead.\" Some would argue that emotional infidelity can actually help a primary relationship, but Hall disagrees: \"Just because chocolate makes you feel good, it doesn't make you healthy. There's a tendency to say, 'I'm getting my emotional needs met elsewhere, which cuts down my frustration with my partner.' Men have used that excuse for years to have sex.\" Names have been changed. · Joanna Briscoe's novel, Sleep With Me, is published on July 4 by Bloomsbury at £12.99.

It's an excerpt from 48 Rutgers Law\nReview 397, 448-468, ANIMAL RIGHTS AND ANIMAL WELFARE  Copyright 1995 by\nGary L. Francione. Portions of this article are taken from the book Rain\nWithout Thunder. Footnotes are omitted. CRITERION #1: An Incremental Change Must Constitute a Prohibition ...Thus the first criterion for any incremental change, beyond the\nincremental education of the public about the need to abolish\ninstitutionalized animal exploitation, is that it must prohibit some\nreasonably identifiable behavior. This prohibition must also correlate with\nthe ability of the animal to claim (through a representative) the protection\nof the right. The requirement that there be a prohibition, and not merely a regulation\nthat requires \"humane\" treatment, is sometimes phrased as requiring the\n\"abolition\" of a particular practice. Although this is a correct description\nof the matter, it can cause confusion by equating the abolition of\ninstitutionalized animal exploitation with incremental measures that, it is\nhoped, will lead to that abolition. On the first level of moral theory,\nanimal rights theory is clearly \"abolitionist\" in that its long-term goal is\nthe complete eradication of institutionalized animal exploitation. What we\nare examining now is whether there are adequate criteria that can be used to\nidentify incremental means to the long-term goal. To say that the incremental means must themselves be \"abolitionist\" is\ncorrect if the definition includes prohibitions against reasonably\nidentifiable conduct which, if engaged in, would constitute a failure to\nrespect a particular animal interest. But these incremental means are by\ndefinition not \"abolitionist\" in the sense that no one incremental\nprohibition will effect the long-term goal of ending animal slavery. In\norder to avoid confusion, it is better to reserve the use of \"abolition\" for\nthe long-term goal of rights theory, and \"prohibition\" as one criterion of\nincremental measures that seek to realize that long-term goal.... CRITERION #2: There Must Be a Prohibition of an Identifiable Activity That\nis Constitutive of the Exploitative Institution Consider the following proposals: Proposal 1: Reduce the number of hens confined in a battery cage (usually\nfloor space is a twelve inch square) from four hens to three hens. Proposal 2: Criminalize the use of animals in drug addiction experiments. These proposals cannot be distinguished using the first criterion alone,\nbecause, for the reasons stated above, both of these can be considered to\ninvolve prohibitions. Although Proposal 2 accords more with the notion of a\nprohibition, Proposal 1 can be conceptualized as a prohibition on keeping\nfour chickens in a cage. This is not to say, however, that there are no distinctions between Proposal\n1 and Proposal 2. With respect to the criminalization of the use of animals\nin a certain type of experiment, a particular activity that is constitutive\nof the general practice of vivisection has been stopped. ...[E]ven if the elimination of the battery cage and the substitution of the\nsmall hen house constitute a prohibition of an activity (i.e., the use of\nthe battery cage), that proposal implicates the problem that the change\nnevertheless continues to sanction the exploitation of the hens, albeit in a\ndifferent form. CRITERION #3: The Prohibition of a Constitutive Activity Must Recognize and\nRespect a Non-Institutional Animal Interest Although there is some controversy over whether animals can be said to have\n\"interests,\" as has been discussed elsewhere, for good reasons, most people,\nincluding those who exploit animals, regard nonhumans as having a wide range\nof interests. The law supposedly protects animal interests. The problem is\nthat for the most part, these interests are those that facilitate the\nexploitation of animals for a particular property use. For example, the law\nprotects the interests of animals used in experiments to the extent\nnecessary to ensure that the animal produces data of the quality considered\nacceptable by research scientists. Indeed, those who support the use of\nanimals in experiments assure the public that \"only those animals that are\ncared for properly will be good research subjects,\"  and that the federal\nAnimal Welfare Act and other sources of regulation provide for the requisite\ncare. In this sense, each form of institutionalized exploitation will have\nrules about the \"humane\" care of animals that are tailored to that\nparticular use of animal property and that reflect the particular concerns\nof that exploitative activity. To the extent that we seek the incremental eradication of the property\nstatus of animals, it is necessary that there is a corresponding recognition\nof the interests of animals in not being regarded as property, or, as Regan\nwould say, in not being treated exclusively as a means to human ends. ...To\neradicate the property status of animals, there must be a recognition of an\ninterest that is noninstitutional, or that is not simply an interest that\nensures the animal is used \"wisely\" in a context of exploitation. It is only\nthrough recognition of extra or noninstitutional interests that incremental\neradication of property status can be achieved; recognition of institutional\ninterests, such as the interest of a turkey destined for slaughter in being\nfed, merely reinforces and supports the property status of animals. ... CRITERION #4: Animal Interests Cannot Be \"Tradable\" ...If there is to be an incremental eradication of the property status of\nanimals, then there must be a recognition that animals have interests that\ngo beyond those interests that must be respected if we are to exploit\nanimals efficiently. And, following the second salient assumption of animal\nrights theory, these non-institutional interests cannot be tradable just\nbecause the aggregation of consequences indicates that the trade is\njustified to secure the human \"benefit.\" Indeed, animals are property\nprecisely because animals have no interests (beyond those that must be\nobserved if the animals are to serve their \"purpose\" as our property) that\nare safe from being balanced away as soon as some human \"benefit\" is\nidentified. In one sense, this criterion seeks to ensure that the incremental\neradication of property status is indeed an incremental \"assembly\" of\npersonhood status for nonhumans through the recognition of the inherent\nvalue of animals. At present, we do not recognize animals as having any\nvalue except for their value to us. For example, philosopher Joseph Raz\nclaims that although animals may have some value apart from their\ninstrumental use to people, animals cannot have inherent value because any\nvalue of the animal ultimately derives from the animal's contribution to the\nhappiness and well-being of some human or humans, who do have inherent\nvalue.  Raz's views are representative of many people's views. The fourth\ncriterion ensures that each incremental move provides for and protects some\nnotion of the inherent value of animals. In one sense, this criterion could be said to address the enforceability of\nprotection for recognized interests. One could say that under slavery as\npracticed in the United States, there were some laws that seemed to\nrecognize that slaves had interests other than ones directly related to\nkeeping a slave alive and fit for whatever purpose the slave was intended.\nFor the most part, however, these interests were ignored whenever they\nconflicted with the interests of the master whose property rights were held\nto outweigh the slave's interests. If animal interests are to be taken\nseriously, then, to the extent that the law regulates the use of animal\nproperty beyond what is necessary to exploit the animal property, that\nregulation must be held as eliminating the property right to the extent\nnecessary to protect the interest. Otherwise, the victory for animals will\nbe illusory; as soon as the rights of human property owners are triggered,\nthe animal interest will be ignored. Accordingly, the interest of the animal must be seen explicitly as an\ninterest that is to be protected as would a true \"right\" within the legal\nsystem. The interest would not be a \"right\" in the full sense in that since\nanimals would not yet possess the basic right not to be regarded as property\n(they would still be used for food and in experiments), they would have\nnonbasic rights that could be said to be building blocks of the basic right\nnot to be property. These nonbasic rights must, however, be treated as\nthough they were rights in the sense that they will be regarded as\nprotecting interests that are not subject to interest balancing. To protect animal interests in this manner would require a very deliberate\nand intentional recognition of a type of legal norm that our legal system\ndoes not yet recognize: a norm that functions like a true right in that it\nrecognizes an interest that cannot be balanced away, but that is held by a\nbeing who has not yet achieved the status of being a holder of the basic\nright not to be regarded exclusively as a means to an end. Indeed, every\ntime we recognize such a right, we move away from treating the being\nexclusively as a means to human ends; the problem is that the being's most\nfundamental interests in not being eaten or used in experiments or kept in a\nzoo have not yet been recognized. These incremental measures may be seen,\nhowever, as recognizing pieces of the basic right not to be regarded as\nproperty. So, although these interests represent nonbasic rights in one\nsense (the animal does not yet by definition have the basic right of not\nbeing property), the interests are more properly regarded as \"parts\" of the\nbasic right of animals not to be treated exclusively as means to human ends. ..In order to recognize that animals have such interests, it is necessary\nthat these interests be understood as trumping the interests of property\nowners. And in order to be effective, it would be necessary for the legal\nsystem to recognize that it is animals who hold this interest, and not their\nowners or government agencies, such as the USDA, which protects only\nthose animal interests that make animals property in the first place. It\nwould be necessary to recognize that animals (or, more properly\nspeaking, the guardians of animals) have standing to articulate these\ninterests against property owners, which would functionally require that\nsome sort of guardian be recognized. Because animals are regarded as property, and property is, by definition and\nseveral hundred years of accepted understanding, that which cannot have\nlegal relations with persons or other property, courts have developed\ndoctrines that preclude animals or their surrogates from articulating their\ninterests in courts of law and before regulatory agencies. This exclusion is\nbased on the supposed inability (in terms of the power of the court) to\nadjudicate claims made by property or those who purport to represent that\nproperty. So, if the ... non-institutional interests of animals are to be\nnon-tradable, then those interests, which must be seen as recognizing\n\"minitrumps\" of the property rights of animal owners, must be protected by\nthe legal system. This will require that animal interests have legal\nstanding and that some human actor (and this could be the police) have\nstanding to articulate those claims before the appropriate body. This is, of\ncourse, not a new idea. In Should Trees Have Standing? -- Toward Legal\nRights for Natural Objects, Christopher Stone argued that the inherent value\nof nonhumans could be recognized and protected by guardians just as are the\nrights (basic rights and nonbasic rights) of children or the mentally\ndisabled. CRITERION #5: The Prohibition Should Not Substitute an Alternative, and\nSupposedly More \"Humane\" Form of Exploitation This fifth criterion follows from both aspects of rights theory identified\nat the outset of this section: that rights theory requires eradication of\nthe property status of animals and that the right of animals not to be\nregarded as property cannot be compromised for consequential reasons. In\nmany respects, this fifth criterion is the most significant of the group\nbecause it often will be the most helpful in determining whether a proposed\nincremental measure is consistent with rights theory, although, like the\nother criteria, this one is not exact and will not provide an easy answer in\nall cases. But then, the idea is to try to make a morally informed decision,\nand not necessarily one that is always right. The fifth criterion holds that it is inconsistent with rights theory to\ntreat some animals exclusively as means to the ends of others, or as\nproperty, in order to secure some benefit that it is hoped will eventually\nsecure a higher moral status for other animals. This is a serious problem\nfor the new welfarist who purports to endorse the long-term goal of animal\nrights by using short-term welfarist reforms as a means to the end of\nabolition of institutionalized exploitation. The new welfarist disregards the inherent value of some animals in order to\nsecure a benefit for other animals. For example, the federal Animal Welfare\nAct provides that animals  may be used in biomedical experiments as long as\ntheir use is \"humane\" and they are not forced to suffer \"unnecessarily.\" The\nnew welfarists, who supported the 1985 amendments to the Act, believe that\nthe Act will itself reduce animal suffering, but more importantly, that laws\nlike the Act are \"stepping stones\" to the future recognition and respect of\nanimals other than the ones whose interests are now being ignored. This\nArticle argued earlier that there is simply no way to determine whether laws\nlike the Act actually reduce animal suffering, and that, given the\nstructural defects of welfare theory generally, such laws will generally be\nheld only to require that conduct that facilitates the use of the animal as\nproperty. Apart from the rather puzzling logic of how we get to a\nnon-property status of animals by persistent reinforcement of the property\nparadigm, there is something objectionable on a theoretical level when a\nrights advocate explicitly endorses the property status of animals as a way\nof eradicating that status on an incremental basis. ...So, for example, a complete prohibition on the use of chimpanzees in\ncertain procedures can reasonably be said to constitute the prohibition of a\nconstitutive activity, but to the extent that the advocate urges or accepts\nthat other animals, such as dogs, should be used instead...such a rule would\nviolate the fundamental proscription against speciesism. In order to understand more fully the point of this fifth criterion,\nconsider the following example: animal advocates propose to lobby for a law\nthe preamble of which explicitly recognizes that animals have moral\ninterests and the current configuration of battery hens per cage disrespects\nthose moral interests. The body of the law provides that in recognition of\nthe interests that hens have, no more than two shall be placed in battery\ncages, and these cages shall be enlarged to provide 196 inches of floorspace\nrather than 144 inches. The egg industry objects to this arrangement\nvehemently as it is \"unnecessary\" to maximize the value of animal property\nand will, in fact, impose a very significant cost on the ownership of animal\nproperty in this context. The law provides that this interest must be\nprotected irrespective of the economic consequences and contains penalties\nto ensure that the interests are not recognized subject to complete\ndefeasance through a claim of human \"benefit.\" The traditional welfarist would undoubtedly support this measure because it\nwill, in the welfarist's view, reduce animal suffering. The new welfarist,\nwho seeks as a long-term goal the abolition of animal exploitation, will\nalso undoubtedly support this, not only because it will supposedly reduce\nsuffering, but because it is a \"stepping stone\" or \"springboard\" into\nabolition at some future time. The new welfarist and the traditional\nwelfarist have the same view -- that the measure will reduce suffering --\nbut the new welfarist, unlike the traditional welfarist, believes that\nbecause the measure will reduce suffering, it will act as an incremental\nmeasure on the road to the long-term goal. The animal rights advocate first dismisses the view that avoiding pain and\nsuffering are the only interests that animals (human or nonhuman) have. If\npain and suffering were the only relevant moral interests, then what would\nprevent us from using small numbers of \"undesirable\" humans to eradicate\nlarge amounts of human pain and suffering? Obviously, although we all have\nstrong interests in avoiding pain and suffering, we do limit the ways in\nwhich pain and suffering can be alleviated so as to respect other\ninterests -- such as the rights of humans (and nonhumans) -- as well.\nSecond, the rights advocate dismisses the new welfarist view, also\narticulated by Singer, that a measure that reduces pain and suffering will\nlead to incremental achievement of the long-term goal of equal consideration\nfor equal interests (Singer) or the abolition of all institutionalized\nexploitation (Regan) simply because it supposedly reduces pain and\nsuffering. The rights advocate knows that some measures that supposedly\nreduce pain and suffering will do nothing more than assure that animals\nreceive protection that is consistent with their status as property, and\nthat facilitates their use as particular types of property. The rights advocate begins by asking whether the proposal contains a\nprohibition or a regulation, and concludes that the proposal prohibits\nkeeping more than two hens in the cage. She is unclear as to whether, even\nif the proposal is a prohibition, it constitutes a prohibition of an\nactivity that is constitutive of the overall form of exploitation. She errs\nin favor of regarding the measure as prohibiting a constitutive activity.\nShe is clear, however, that the proposal provides for the recognition of an\ninterest that is extra-institutional in that it provides for the recognition\nof an interest that is not tied to the property status of the hens. The\nproposal recognizes that the hens have inherent value beyond their status as\nproperty, which would justify only that level of regulation that facilitated\nanimal use. Moreover, the proposal provides that these interests cannot be\ntraded away and constitute proto-rights. The problem with the proposal is that it is, on its face, not only\nconsistent with the status of animals as property that, as a general matter,\nlacks inherent value, but does so in a way that explicitly trades away the\nbasic right of the hens not to be property in favor of a recognition of\nmoral status that falls short of recognition of the basic right, or the\ncomplete protection of some interest that the animal has in, for example,\nbodily movement. By agreeing to the two-hen arrangement, animal advocates\nare trying to achieve proto-rights while at the same time endorsing an\nalternative form of exploitation -- two hens in a cage -- that is supposedly\nmore \"humane.\" In the present case, it seems reasonable to say that the interest involved\nis the interest that the hens have -- all of them -- in not being in the\nbattery cage in the first place and in having freedom of movement that is\nappropriate to the species. To the extent that the proposal recognizes and\nrespects that interest, then the prohibition arguably does not substitute\nanother form of exploitation and is acceptable. That is, assume that a\nprohibition abolishes the battery cage entirely and replaces it with a\nrearing system that accommodates all of the hen's interests in freedom of\nmovement and thereby fully recognizes the interest of the hen's bodily\nintegrity. Such a state of affairs may be another way of saying that the\nprohibition ends a particular form of exploitation that has violated a\nparticular non-institutional, non-tradable interest that we have now decided\nto respect. But this sort of substitution differs considerably from merely\nremoving two of the hens from the cage in that although we have not yet\nabolished the institutionalized exploitation, the substitution eliminates\nthe exploitation involved in the confinement system through a full\nrecognition of the interest of the hens in their freedom of movement. In any event, any substitution of exploitation raises serious questions for\nthe rights advocate. If the incremental eradication of the property status\nof animals is going to be consistent with rights theory, it is important\nthat proposed measures not substitute one form of exploitation for another,\nsupposedly more \"humane\" form of exploitation. Oftentimes, the alternative\nform of exploitation will provide in general terms for \"humane\" treatment,\nwhich then feeds the whole matter right back through the mechanisms of legal\nwelfarism which, as argued before, are structurally defective and\nsystematically devalue animal interests. But even if the substitute form of\nexploitation is more definite (i.e., there shall be no more than two birds\nper cage), and even if the proposal recognizes that the animals have some\ninherent value that justifies the recognition of a non-institutional,\nnon-tradable interest, that recognition comes at the expense of endorsing\nanother form of exploitation that rests on the legitimacy of the status of\nanimals as property. This sacrifices the moral right of the animal not to be\nproperty for a proto-right that is designed to effect the incremental\neradication of property status. The substitution of exploitation raises\nissues of moral conflict with rights theory, and incoherence in light of the\nfundamental assumptions of that theory. This discussion does serve, however, to demonstrate that as a practical\nmatter, certain campaigns will be difficult for animal rights advocates to\npursue if they agree with this fifth criterion. It seems that the rights\nadvocate really has no choice but to condemn any form of substitute\nexploitation, unless that alternative arrangement completely eradicates an\nactivity constitutive of animal exploitation through the full recognition of\nrelevant animal interests. The animal advocate must not herself suggest an\nalternative, and must not agree to any alternative offered by the exploiter.\nTo do either would involve the rights advocate sacrificing the basic right\nof animals not to be property in order to secure a less-than-basic\nproto-right that, while it does recognize and respect that animals have\nperson-like interests that transcend their status as property, is achieved\nat the cost of reinforcing the notion that a \"better\" system of animal\nslavery is acceptable. These considerations would militate in favor of\nconducting the sort of campaign that may not succeed (at least initially),\nbut that will have a potentially powerful effect on educating members of the\npublic about animal exploitation. And in many respects, such education,\nwhether sought directly in the classroom or as part of a militant campaign\nsuch as one that supports a law to demand the end of the egg battery and\nthat urges no substitute form of exploitation (rather than a reactionary and\nconservative welfarist campaign to make the matters more \"humane\" for the\nhens) is probably the best thing that the animal rights advocate can do at\nthis stage of history in any event."}]}
